(Create an account if necessary)Strictly for NUS, NTU and SMU AY2019/20 only. For other unis please look up on their respective pages.Links will be updated from time to time.For chance rating: provide your (JC) grade profile & rank point - consider MT grade, rebase and take the higher of the two (original rank point or rebased rank point) or (Poly) poly course + 5th/6th sem CGPA + O Level L1R4, ranking of choices as well as citizenship status (Singaporean/ SPR/ International Student).15% of spaces for each university are reserved for DA. NUS and NTU still counts 20% O Level results for this round of admissions (the policy will be scrapped from 2020). For SMU, admission is based on 100% Poly GPA. All O Level subject requirements still apply. For NUS, first choice bonus admission points will apply to both A Level (1.25rp) and Poly (1pt) students for all non-interview courses, so please indicate if it is your first choice. [Poly to NUS SOC] Also note that if you are intending to apply to NUS Computing/ Computer Engineering and you do not have AMath/ Poly Math qualifications, your application to that course is considered a DA application no matter how high your GPA is.R/SGEXAMS UNI ADMISSION THREAD for referencehttps://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/com...ts_megathread/Previous year threads:2018-2019 (HWZ)2018-2019 (Reddit)2017-2018 Part 1 (HWZ)2017-2018 Part 2 (HWZ)2017-2018 (Reddit)2016-2017 Part 12016-2017 Part 22015-20162014-2015Useful Links:NUS IGP 2018/19NTU IGP 2018/19SMU IGP 2018/19Historical IGP Google SheetHistorical GES Google SheetMay the odds be ever in your favour", "timestamp": "04-12-2018, 12:32 AM#1"},

If you really wish to get into NTU, I suggest you re-take subjects you did badly/mediocre in your O'levels and try to score an A.cheeyarn wrote:  Hi, i have really no idea... it has bugging me for quite awhile. I took amaths and economics during my secondary and poly time respectively. I also applied for nus fass for the previous 2 years, but they rejected me too which i dunno why.  Could it be the reason that i am serving ns now? I kinda at a loss about what to do. I dont really wanna go SIM with my gpa! No! In fact, NS should be an advantage especially if you get into command school! (That is also considered a non-accademic achievement) Other awards like best soldier may help too! NS is the best time to talk about your experiences and what made you decide (forgive me if I sound too drama or cliche) on going into that dream course! NTU/NUS/SMU requires students to write more about themselves for the courses they require to get into/why and there is a portion for non-accademic achievements. Remember to fill that up! Don't think it is not important because there are many people with the same GPA as you, so how do they consider applicants? To see if they have any additional talents/achievements they can bring with them outside their GPA!!! I cannot stress this enough, especially if you are from a poly! Also, I feel you about not being able to get into a local university of my choice! I screwed up my admission to get into my several dream courses at various Local U's during the first year because I thought they only look at GPA, and hence I didn't really bother much with the interview/and did not fill my non-CCA achievements. I thought I would definitely secure a place butI was so FRIGGIN WRONG. I felt like I was going to die literally because I couldn't get into a Local U. It was awful because I worked so friggin hard in poly D': Fortunately, I managed to pull myself together and manage to not screw up the second time and got into a local U with a course of my choice  So, DONT GIVE UP BRO. Now that you are closer to ORD, find some time to improve yourself, hunt down your poly lecturer to write you that testimonial letter for your university admission as they will really help. You are a merit holder, I am sure you have worked hard for it and paid attention during leessons. Your lecturers \u4f1a\u7ed9\u4f60\u9762\u5b50 if you are sincere and ask nicely!   If all else fails, there is always a local university route outside of NTU/NUS and it can be even better than the two.. but I can't say here.. later people will think I am biased towards certain university...

For NTU accountacny, your chances are very very slim. Your GPA is somewhat moderately-far away from their 10th Percentile at a difference of 0.1.  Your O level seem to be decent. But nevertheless, if it is your dream course and you have a strong interest for it , go and apply  . Just be sure to get more testimonial letters/recommendation letters/do some cca's etc. After all, 10th Percentile of 3.79 for NTU accountancy is just a guide, not an actual cut off For SMU Accountancy, your GPA is relatively close to the 10th percentile of 3.72, so you may be shortlisted (I would say 40-55% chance) for the interview. Just be sure to fill in the non-accademic portion and the short essay /3 CCA's you think are most important to you. Those are very important because SMU does not just look at grades solely. They want to see if you have the potential to be holistically successful and be an all rounder. Same for what I recommend as the NTU one. If you do get shortlisted, you must do well for the group interview/single person interview (For SMU accountancy, I've heard they do either one of this) or you still won't get accepted. Take note that, this is based off the Indicative Grade Profile (IGP) based on year 2013 for year 2014 admissions. The  IGP based on year 2014 for 2015 admissions will be out within a month and you may have to wait and see to determine what course of action you need to take.", "timestamp": "21-11-2014, 01:56 PM#15"},

Can you all advise if SUSS or SIT would be better?", "timestamp": "27-12-2018, 09:40 PM#5"},

The key lies in the wording, 'provisional offer' would mean that NUS/NTU can still retract their offers if they deem that your cGPA is not up to par. But this is unlikely because most people with good 5sem cGPA will unlikely have a bad final cGPA. Additionally, please, for the 10000-th time, IGP is not cut-off. IGP is merely a guide. I know people who got in even though their scores were far off from the IGP, the IGPs don't matter at all. 3.6 vs 3.59, they won't kick you because of that.

Yes I know it isnt the cut-off, thus the inverted commas in my post, cause I do understand that there are many cases of people with even lower scores getting in.  But with regards to the cGPA drop, I am actually asking due to my personal experience. Due to circumstances and a rough internship experience, I forsee a small plunge in my personal cGPA by about 0.04 or worse case by 0.1 (depending on how much rougher things are gonna get). With my current 5sem cGPA, I am above the 10th percentile for both the courses I want, one of which is by a small 0.03 margin and another by a 0.1+ margin.  The main concern now is whether there's a major reason for me to be worried, be it for my grades itself, or a possible provisional offer rejection. I have also read on a post that in the conditional offer letters given by the Unis, there is no where stating a minimum gpa requirement with regards to the final semester, the only stated requirement being to pass and graduate without forwarding to a 7th semester.", "timestamp": "08-01-2014, 10:30 PM#8"},

Why are you so worked up about the IGP, the open and close inverted commas should alr mean that it isnt really a cut-off, the only reason I used it was for a rough gauge, because that is the closest thing any of us have to measure our chances of entering a course we want. What you say is true, but the chances of that happening can be as good as zero, though the IGP fluctuates every year and works similar to the polytechnic cut-off point, it is still the closes guide we have to choosing which course we have a chance to get into and which we don't. As for the situation, yea, not aiming for those 3, am actually aiming for FASS in NUS and trying to salvage my current situation anyway I can.  On a side-note, has anyone from poly purposely failed a semester that they did badly in to have a forward semester to actually do better? Does it have any other effects, like maybe a record of you failing a semester, or a maximum grade attainable for the forward semester, etc?", "timestamp": "09-01-2014, 09:52 AM#10"},

She said her A Level results were pretty decent, which might be why she got into the course. I tried again this year. I did a metric crap-ton of volunteering with 2 different Hospitals *AND* I managed to get a job as a Physiotherapy Assistant using that Volunteer experience. The pay is horrible, the hours are worse and it's an hour+ bus ride from my house to work each way. Though it's a small price to pay for the invaluable clinical experience *PLUS* the increased profile as far as potentially getting into the course. In addition, whole learning experience in these past 6 months has been incredible, to say the least...loveaddict wrote:  Can I ask why physio? There are other prog available also you can look at. Physio not easy... Suggest you go do some job shadowing first. Well, I can only speak for myself: I already did that!  I know it ain't easy, having to lift at least 2 high-dependency patients a week (I know that might not sound like much but it's inherently risky for both me and the patient) and the facilitation required for some patients to move properly is a *HUGE* learning curve and have already strained a few joints here and there, more than my entire decade as a Personal Trainer, PE Teacher, even as a Combatives & Self Defense Instructor with full-contact sparring hasn't seen this many strains in the 6 months on the job. A colleague has been on at least a month of light duties as a result of back strain she encountered while trying to assist a super-maximum-dependency patient (she failed, the patient fell  ).

There is also occupational therapy as well.  Heard physiotherapy is a pretty popular choice. What with all the hype about physio anyways? Me thinks it's a follow-on from the fact that the Poly course @ NYP is gone, which has been popular for the longest time. That and the fact that it may very well be seen as a \"glamorous\" potentially high-paying job (if you get into private practice, maybe, though I may be totally off on that), maybe add to the fact that it's also a way to get into a medical-type field without being a Doctor or Nurse... For me, I have an indelibly greater connection with the profession, on top of my work experience and education, as I am a living, breathing success-story, having suffered multiple injuries in a near-fatal car crash, successfully rehabilitated and fully recovered through intensive Physiotherapy.

Salary increments are also determined by your job performance grading and the experience as well. However I admit that what you said it's true, writing skills alone will not get you the job, so I slipped my mind on that one. My main point is, people from arts and social sciences do have their own special skill sets that is needed by many industries so we shouldn't downplay their capabilities too alright.

Not all courses are writing based courses, like Economics, it is very mathematical based in uni. Because I don't believe just good writing skills alone can land you in a very high position, without a \"actual\" strength or expertise.

It's a straight A course but many pharmacy graduates are struggling. Law also is oversaturated. Engineers no need to say, FT's are being brought in droves. Accountancy is facing threat of automation and oversaturation too, not to mention the work life that kills you. Business is too general of a degree etc. It's really how one uses university to springboard into the working life. I don't see how productive it is to be bashing on an entire faculty when it encompasses many areas of study. I can say engineer is useless since can just bring in FT's who are cheaper, better, faster but I'm not considering the different engineering fields am I like comp engineering, civil engineering, EEE and so on. I believe you are from FASS as you mentioned previously. You have been mentioning the cons of every other courses. So hence what is your view about your own home faculty? What are the advantages about being in FASS in terms of job prospects, salary, as well as employment. It is generally very true when razorlala has brought up the Graduate Employment Survey. What area/course in FASS are you pursuing? Are you pursuing it based on good career prospects, potential high salary, interests or passion to serve the community? So how does Arts and Social Sci is better than other courses when you mentioned about the cons of all other courses?(When it is an undeniable fact as it is clearly shown in the employment survey stats). It is good if you could clarify since it is your home faculty?", "timestamp": "03-06-2017, 11:45 PM#10"},

Eg if the university has decided an internal indicative cut off point 3.82, being a 3.81 with good record (subjective) of non-academic achievements/experiences would be the deciding factor if you get in or not. Thanks!!!  Hopefully, 10th percentile this year goes a bit lower. And just wondering..Will I stand a better chance if I bring up anything under discretionary admission?

Yup, better chance because you will be considered for the grades-based admission and non-academic admission (it has to be something that proves you can 'survive' the vigorous education structure in the university.) It may not be a leadership position that you have to elaborate on. It can be the things you have learnt from your CCA and how it has applied to the business environment too eg soft skills like time management and collaboration. It can also be things you have suggested and how they are successful or appreciated by your peers.", "timestamp": "07-08-2016, 04:45 PM#9993"},

I have been considering applying for a science course in either NUS or NTU ,such as chemistry,pharmacy,life sciences etc.  1) Medicine? I ruled out medicine as I thought it's out of the question, as I didn't expect to get nearly straight As + my lack of good CCA records &consistent CIP. However, seeing my results, my mum asked me to try for medicine, saying that I might have chance of getting in. I could only apply to NUS since I didn't take the BMAT for NTU. The main question would be of course:whether I have a passion in serving as a doctor.  To be honest, I don't really have a clear idea. I enjoyed learning the various body systems and diseases in Sec 4 Bio but have never seriously considered to enter medicine. My interest in Bio is reduced in JC as we started learning micro things instead of the human body.  Qn: What do medicine students really study? Would it be back to Sec4 Bio kind of syllabus but of higher level? I joined Red Cross as a CCA in JC because I don't really have other choices and I was slightly interested in the various first aid equipment like which is used to treat what. Throughout the 1.5 years, I've only volunteered a few times outside of school as a first aider(as I was struggling with JC academically). Seeing other fellow passionate first aiders I was inspired by their commitment. I also learnt the joy of serving as the casualty thanked me after I helped them bandage their wounds. However, I also discovered a problem with myself, that is I'm afraid to talk with strangers, let alone offering support/comfort for the casualty,using words. Although I care about them, I don't dare to show it. I have no idea why I have grown into such a shy person <- this is what I heard from quite a few people.  My other concern would be my mediocre CCA record, which is quite important to enter medicine apart from grades right? I have no CCA positions throughout my life and also no stellar CIP records(as I mentioned-have to keep mugging in jc). I don't think I still have chance for medicine =_= Actually I have applied for two attachments to hospitals so as to enrich my experience in the healthcare sector and also beef up my record, sadly both were rejected,one by JC and one by RMG. Through this experience, I'm convinced that I wouldn't fit as a doctor, so I stopped considering medicine. Besides, I'm also worried about the stress of being a medical student and subsequently as a doctor. I have experienced various weird symptoms in my body due to stress since secondary school. From bruxism leading to Temporomandibular Joint Disorders and sensitive teeth, stomachache before exams, to pimple outbreak before As, I am thinking what else would happen to me under the stress in medical school. Even though I have taken steps to relieve stress by exercising or whatsoever, I realised I'm a person who likes to overthink and give myself stress. If so, I think I wouldn't survive in medicine. All in all, do you think I should go for pharmacy instead of medicine? So that 1. I can still help others in a healthcare sector and take time to improve my social skills without killing a life if I were to enter medicine. 2. I can face less stress compared to being in medicine?? (Tbh, I can only visualize myself as a researcher making contribution towards science behind the scene instead of being a front-line person, although I havent had any true research experience lol) 2) Bio vs Chem As mentioned earlier, I liked Bio less in JC because the syllabus is full of micro-level stuff and also cuz of its rigidness (like there's tons to keywords to memorise). I enjoyed Chem in JC more probably because it's easier to learn. In my case, should I apply for chem course instead of bio(life sciences/biological science)?

From bruxism leading to Temporomandibular Joint Disorders and sensitive teeth, stomachache before exams, to pimple outbreak before As, I am thinking what else would happen to me under the stress in medical school. Even though I have taken steps to relieve stress by exercising or whatsoever, I realised I'm a person who likes to overthink and give myself stress. If so, I think I wouldn't survive in medicine. All in all, do you think I should go for pharmacy instead of medicine? So that 1. I can still help others in a healthcare sector and take time to improve my social skills without killing a life if I were to enter medicine. 2. I can face less stress compared to being in medicine?? (Tbh, I can only visualize myself as a researcher making contribution towards science behind the scene instead of being a front-line person, although I havent had any true research experience lol) 2) Bio vs Chem As mentioned earlier, I liked Bio less in JC because the syllabus is full of micro-level stuff and also cuz of its rigidness (like there's tons to keywords to memorise). I enjoyed Chem in JC more probably because it's easier to learn. In my case, should I apply for chem course instead of bio(life sciences/biological science)? Pardon me for the long post as I didn't really have someone to talk to...Your help is deeply appreciated!! Wow is this a GP essay hahaha.. Ya it's good to be a researcher too cos u still can contribute greatly to our society! \ud83d\udc4d", "timestamp": "05-03-2017, 10:41 PM#90"},

I can only say there are more opportunities for people like you to be able to be admitted via DA, however do note that there are a lot of people like you with the exact same circumstances. You could have a shot though 2. All poly students who applies during their third year (next Feb) will have to apply with 5sem. There isn't really much difference when applying with 5sem or with 6sem later unless your GPA falls or rises a lot more 3. For sports DAs please approach your coaches.

I am not interested in other universities. Both NTU and NUS do not offer my course, so the only local university option is SMU. However, i might be planning to work overseas and need some advice though i am more incline towards university of edinburgh due to its international reputation and overseas experience which will expose me to more stuffs. Heard good things about the business school of edinburgh and warwick but friends in the industry strongly reccomended edinburgh. I dont really care about rankings since they can be artifically manipulated but out of those you listed i would be more inclined to lean towards Warwick, the reputation in UK is really solid. Of course it also depends on what course your applying for.. I'd rather stay local than head to Edinburgh, unless yours is the insanely expensive medical course which I doubt so", "timestamp": "05-12-2014, 02:14 AM#4831"},

My sister from JC has a friend who scored all A's but got rejected by SMU because he flunked the interview. The uni is known to reject top graduates from RI/Hwa Chung (Kind of dumb to do so) but yeah.. not everyone who gets the interview will be able to get in. I would like to share my personal experience on my first group interview/test in 2013 admissions. Back than, there was a huge volume being interviewed for the students who applied for the course, and I was put in a relatively bigger than average group. It was really competitive and at every point in time, there would be people fighting for airtime. Sad to say, I screwed up for my first interview as I didn't~ really create a first good impression. Based on what I hear from my other friends and personal experience, the first interview you have with SMU (E.G of a total of 15-20 students attending the group interview) only 2-5 will be deemed \"good enough\" to pass If you recall in 2013 admissions, there was one news article headline \"7000 shortlisted students and SMU will interview them all\". However, if you look at the placing offered for the 2013, only 1933 out of the 7000 students were lucky enough to gain entry. That means that 27.61% of the shortlisted candidates managed to pass the interview, and succeeded in vying a spot in SMU against their poly/JC peers So, no. Getting shortlisted for the interview does not mean you definitely get a spot xD I learnt that the hard and painful way. a&w_rootbeerz wrote:  That's why. Really funny that guy.

The other courses are really passion-based jobs, like Philisophy, History, English, Chinese, Sociology, Pschology, these courses most likely become teachers or community or welfare-services based jobs.

Not all courses are writing based courses, like Economics, it is very mathematical based in uni. Because I don't believe just good writing skills alone can land you in a very high position, without a \"actual\" strength or expertise. Just like engineering students are equipped with engineering skills, accountancy students have a set of accounting skills. Just merely writing skills is not a specialised set of skills to enable you far., All the fields have their pros and cons. To say one is \"useless\" is a sweeping statement. Look at the NUS pharmacy. It's a straight A course but many pharmacy graduates are struggling. Law also is oversaturated. Engineers no need to say, FT's are being brought in droves. Accountancy is facing threat of automation and oversaturation too, not to mention the work life that kills you. Business is too general of a degree etc. It's really how one uses university to springboard into the working life. I don't see how productive it is to be bashing on an entire faculty when it encompasses many areas of study. I can say engineer is useless since can just bring in FT's who are cheaper, better, faster but I'm not considering the different engineering fields am I like comp engineering, civil engineering, EEE and so on.", "timestamp": "03-06-2017, 10:59 PM#9989"},

I've been in the government sector for two years and there are many (if not, nearly all) departments in the sector who are in need of arts and social sciences degrees because of their flair in writing and  policy making. Many of the people working there possess arts degrees If you're referring to specialised jobs such as engineering and information security then the demand isn't there but when you said it is the most useless degree in careers, that is not true. Speaking from experience and I hope you can provide some statistics to prove your statements. If not, let's just focus on the topic of admissions. I am looking at employment statistics of various schools with respect to course of study. Arts and social sciences are always the lowest, with psychology being the lowest. Arts and ss also has the lowest % of ppl securing full time employment.  If u expect citations on a forum, you should set the example. Show me your sources where you got the sweeping statement that nearly all govt sector needs art graduates for policymaking LOL", "timestamp": "03-06-2017, 11:00 PM#9990"},

Is the bachelor degree Accountancy harder to get in compared to the engineering degrees such as Chemical Engineering?  What are your thoughts on my chances of being admitted? Hmmm. I think engineering is easier to get in for international students. Reason being  A) there isn't a strong demand from Singaporeans for engineering courses in local universities. Singaporeans largely prefer courses like biz/acct, law, Med, even FASS over engineering. B) cohort size for engineering is really huge. NTU's College of Engin is probably the bigger than NBS. So there's a higher chance. But between accountancy and chemical engineering I would say both are equally hard to get in for foreigners. You might want to try mechanical engineering or electrical and electronic engineering at NTU. You have a chance for engineering but unlikely that you'll get into accountancy IMO.", "timestamp": "22-09-2016, 10:49 PM#65"},

{"name": "Jackel_Yang", "message": "tryingtohelp wrote:  Shdn't more business slot drive down the IGP for BA more? Haha. Good old econs concept: Demand & Supply curve both shift, but demand curve shifted more.  The increase demand for Biz slots outweighed the increase in supply. The decrease in demand for Acc outweighed the decrease in supply. Hence Biz (3.80) > Acc (3.79). This is evident from the transfer system this year. In the past, Acc students can freely switch to Biz, where Biz students need a certain GPA + interview to transfer to Acc. Since this year, it's equally difficult to transfer between the two.

So there are more options if one chooses biz, rather than accountancy. Yup, due to SQP, more (well-informed) students are opting for Biz over Acc.  Take note that I didn't mis-type. NBS did increase the number of slots for Business while reducing the slots for Accountancy. (There used to be an even number for both courses, but now there are more seats allocated for Biz than for Acc. ) As such, you would expect the cut off for Business to drop, and the cut off for Acc to increase. But the shift in demand among students was equal / greater than this effect. Had NBS not adjusted the intake, the effect would be very clear. Biz IGP would have spiked like crazy, while acc would drop.  2012: 607 Acc, 591 Biz. 2013: 595 Acc, 655 Biz.  Source:http://www3.ntu.edu.sg/oad2/website_...GP/NTU_IGP.pdfhttp://www3.ntu.edu.sg/oad2/website_...Y12-13_IGP.pdf Summary : More students are choosing Biz over Acc. Hence Biz is getting harder to get in. NBS adjusted intake to match market demand. Hence IGP is still relatively stable.", "timestamp": "12-11-2014, 11:29 AM#4823"},
