There were 11 others with me as well. So we were given a passage and 2 5-marks questions, with 30 minutes to complete the test. I would suggest you manage the time well, 10 min for reading, 10 min for each question. I don't think they'll be using the same passage, perhaps you can tell me your topic after your interview.  My passage was an extract from this rather 'ancient' philosopher's book. About 1.5 pages long with word size of probably 10. The 2 questions are based on the passage, somewhat like GP's comprehension; 1 question asking about the explanation of the content , the other asking for summary of arguments made by the author. I did manage to see how much my peers wrote, and to my horror, many of them wrote at least 1 page for each question. I just answered straight to the point with as much detailed and concise elaborations (probably barely half a page). So if you have the same worry as me, just remember that quality can definitely make up for quantity. At least I know that if I had written 1 page long, my answer will probably be worse off >.< No time for flowery language honestly. Second part was the actual interview by professors. It's a 1-1 interview in the prof's office. As there were 12 of us with 3 profs, they split us up into 3 groups. Most probably in alphabetical order. My name starts with 'A', so I was interviewed first in my group. 3 interviews were carried out simultaneously in various offices. There isn't a time limit per se, so I guess you could ramble on for as long as you prefer. During the interview, my interviewer ran through the process with me first. 3 main questions. 1. Something more academic, based on the written test. So it was like a chance to elaborate on what you've missed out, or for you to clarify on certain thoughts. No hard and fast rule with this. 2. Based on philosophy's fields of study, talk about what interests you in Philo. (It's basically why you chose Philosophy).  3. Elaborate on CCAs, what made you who you are, what changed your beliefs, any turning points in life etc (that kind of questions). Do take note though, the interviewer may refer (many times) to your application, be it choice of courses, CCA, results and what you wrote for discretionary etc. As for my interviewer, it seemed like he took a good look at the hardcopy of my application. Thank goodness I remembered the details of it.  Also, he actually made it very obvious that he's jotting down pointers of what you say from first question onwards, and he will write things that impresses him as you speak. So feel free to share your glorious history with your interviewer (of course it has to have some link with his main questions). Lastly, the interviewer will ask you if you have any queries. Ask something sensible and pertaining to philosophy or the school's pedagogy. You can PM me if you want to know what I asked. The interview process was a rather enjoyable one, semi-formal? We had a nice chat on some aspects of philosophy that I was interested in; and there's really nothing wrong if you're not sure on how to answer the questions. Just make a deliberate pause, at least to look like you're thinking through your answer, and do answer as logically as possible. Fact is, philosophy is based on logic.  Some tips for preparations: 1. Look up some of the famous philosophers and their background. You might kena one of them for your passage. 2. Look through the curriculum, and decide what you're interested in. Wiki is your best friend if you need explanations on the concepts. 3. Be honest with your background, but speak smartly and emphasize on your strengths. They just want to know you better. Best of luck for your interview tomorrow. PM me if you need anything else. Don't worry, the profs are really friendly. I heard much laughter coming from the other 2 rooms while I was in the interview. Hi! The written test was really challenging, it was about Rene. Everything was as expected for the interview portion, thank you so much for your help! I am not sure if I will be able to get in but thanks once again.",13.470880602362577

I took amaths and economics during my secondary and poly time respectively. I also applied for nus fass for the previous 2 years, but they rejected me too which i dunno why.  Could it be the reason that i am serving ns now? I kinda at a loss about what to do. I dont really wanna go SIM with my gpa! No! In fact, NS should be an advantage especially if you get into command school! (That is also considered a non-accademic achievement) Other awards like best soldier may help too! NS is the best time to talk about your experiences and what made you decide (forgive me if I sound too drama or cliche) on going into that dream course! NTU/NUS/SMU requires students to write more about themselves for the courses they require to get into/why and there is a portion for non-accademic achievements. Remember to fill that up! Don't think it is not important because there are many people with the same GPA as you, so how do they consider applicants? To see if they have any additional talents/achievements they can bring with them outside their GPA!!! I cannot stress this enough, especially if you are from a poly! Also, I feel you about not being able to get into a local university of my choice! I screwed up my admission to get into my several dream courses at various Local U's during the first year because I thought they only look at GPA, and hence I didn't really bother much with the interview/and did not fill my non-CCA achievements. I thought I would definitely secure a place butI was so FRIGGIN WRONG. I felt like I was going to die literally because I couldn't get into a Local U. It was awful because I worked so friggin hard in poly D': Fortunately, I managed to pull myself together and manage to not screw up the second time and got into a local U with a course of my choice  So, DONT GIVE UP BRO. Now that you are closer to ORD, find some time to improve yourself, hunt down your poly lecturer to write you that testimonial letter for your university admission as they will really help. You are a merit holder, I am sure you have worked hard for it and paid attention during leessons. Your lecturers 会给你面子 if you are sincere and ask nicely!   If all else fails, there is always a local university route outside of NTU/NUS and it can be even better than the two.. but I can't say here.. later people will think I am biased towards certain university...

I've been offered NTU Maritime Studies from 2012 and NUS Mechanical Engineering this year.  Initially, I swayed towards Maritime but am afraid that it is too specialized and am afraid that job prospects could be bad in 4 or so years time.  Mechanical Engineering is very broad and prospects seem better but I'm not really sure if I really wanna do it.  If both NUS and NTU offered me the same course, I'll choose NUS. But the different courses are making my choice difficult. Pls let me know your views. Any advice is greatly appreciated. Thanks Christ... For pete's sake, NUS and NTU - No f**king difference. When you graduate from either schools from the same course like mech eng to mech eng, employment will be the same. The school's name will not shortchange you of anything. Want to go with that ""NUS better branding"" thinking then please, be sure to tell your employer from the private sector that, instead of choosing the school with the modules you want to study so that you can score well. Same pay, same platform to begin, its not a private school, stop dwelling on it. Mech eng can look at companies like Pratt and Whitney, Rollys Royce, Hyflux, Shell, BP, basically companies that have automation require engineers to maintain, improve and develop them. Get FCH then you can try finance side too, iron rice bowl afterall. Maritime studies is interesting. Its a social science degree. You won't learn engineering there or in depth navigation. You will be taught things like international trade, international law I think, economics, basically the business side of the marine trading industry in Singapore. Can come out as a consultant. I see that NTU has affiliations with MPA so that's a good start. However, it is a niche field, its NOT engineering.  Honestly, I would take mech eng, not that maritime sounds bad. If you have interest in it, then gun it, do f**king well and get headhunted by stat board or private firms.  But please please, look at what you will be learning in these 2 distinct and different courses then make a decision. The modules are online, you can take a look at what you will learn, what tie ups does the school have, what internships can you be looking at, what is the cohort size to assess your competition like. Look at all this first, then make a sound decision rather than lament which school is better. You've already made it to a local U, your not going to do post grad studies after your degree at INSEAD of NUS MBA so, NUS/NTU - SAME PLAYING FIELD",11.653738994879557

I've a senior, an IP student from one of the top JCs who scored straight B's for his A levels did not get called for an interview for his 1st nor 2nd choice at SMU. Fella decided to go to SIM to pursue his studies in a similar field and is earning quite a lot working as a trader for a fund now.  There are a lot of ways you can monetize your degree - as long as you are doing what you want to do you will think of ways to do so. If you're going to do Jap studies but you're interested in Finance, then do take some finance mods if that is possible, join a finance CCA, take up CFA, participate in competitions, write a paper on Japan and show your employer that you are well versed with Jap culture and at the same time highly passionate (and active) in the finance side of things - you will be an amazing hire for a company looking to expand into / their operations in Japan.  It is important for us not to get caught up with the rankings. I cannot stress this enough - at the end of the day, it is who you are, what you've done and how you're working towards your goals that matter, not the reputation of your University.  Just to share: the decision for me was simple back then - I've sorted out my interests, understood what I needed to do... so I picked the one that's closest to where I live  And my parents are both members of KRGH so that made the choice even more obvious! Thanks for the great advice!  I am offered to do Linguistics in NTU, and it's a more attractive offer now especially since I am offered a scholarship there. The truth is, I love languages, and I'm obsessed with Japanese as well. Been learning the language since P5, over 9 years liao. Been exposed to the culture since I was born, so I am very influenced and in love with it. But still, I don't really see the point in doing Japanese Studies.  I am a Tourism/Business student in NP, so I have both business and hospitality backgrounds to fall upon. I am thinking of being a translator/interpreter, but doing Jap Studies would be pointless since I can't just concentrate on just one language. Being an Eng teacher in Japan would be nice as well, and that would require linguistics studies...

Okay lah, NTU did give me an interview for NAA then, but I was young, fresh out of school and had a really naive impression of the world. Also, back then, I barely had a year's worth of working experience, so when the interviewers bombarded me with questions, they basically stepped all over me ... I walked out of the room feeling dejected and at that point, it sank in that the odds stacked against me in getting a place in university were really high.   So for the past three years, I've been slogging my wits out at work at the same company (pretty reputable), and I do have some tiny accomplishments to show. I felt that if I was granted a chance to present myself, I would definitely be much better than in 2011, so I decided to give it another shot this year. Also haha, because zeh zeh old liao, need to go back to school, if not it's now or never. True enough, this year, I got called for two interviews, but I don't know the application results yet. Could answer the interview questions better with more matured viewpoints, but of course, was also thrown a few curveball questions such as, ""Why do you intend to go back to school since you've already entered the workforce?"" Hopefully I explained myself well enough to the interviewers, so can only hope for the best now.  Hahaha sorry for this terribly long post, but for all the poly kids who got rejected ... may my story remind you that it's definitely not the end, so don't give up ... You still have a few years to try for a place in local uni. In the meantime, you can always find a job like I did and work for a few years first.

2015,is|infosys|information systems|comsci|computer science|cs,"How Singapore's six public universities differ Published in ST on 3 March 2015http://www.straitstimes.com/singapor...rsities-differ With six public universities, students now have a diverse range of degrees to choose from. To attract the best students, the universities are striving to be different - in their programmes, tuition fees, student and faculty mix, accommodation options, financial help and overseas opportunities. Calvin Yang looks at the options offered. FULL-TIME DEGREE PROGRAMMES National University of Singapore (NUS): It has more than 50 full-time degrees, with exclusive ones such as those in dentistry, music and pharmacy. Nanyang Technological University (NTU): It has more than 50 degrees, with niche programmes such as communication studies, and sport science and management. Singapore Management University (SMU): It offers seven full-time programmes such as accountancy, law, information systems management and an SUTD-SMU dual degree programme in technology and management, launched last year. Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD): Its five degrees include architecture and sustainable design, engineering product development, engineering systems and design, and information systems technology and design. Singapore Institute of Technology (SIT): Catering mainly to polytechnic graduates, the university has 36 programmes - some offered by reputable partner universities and others run solely by SIT. The programmes include culinary arts management, criminology and security, game design and naval architecture. SIM University (UniSIM): The university synonymous with part-time degrees recently started offering full-time programmes in accountancy, finance and marketing. It will introduce a fourth full-time degree in human resource management this year. TUITION FEES These are for Singaporean students admitted in the academic year 2014/2015, except for UniSIM undergraduates. NUS: Annual tuition fees range between $7,850 - for courses like computing, engineering, and arts and social sciences - and $24,200 for medicine and dentistry. NTU: Fees are between $7,850 for most programmes, and $31,500 for medical students. SMU: Undergraduates who started last August are paying $11,100 per year, except for law students, who are paying $12,300. SUTD: An education at the university costs $11,650 per year. SIT: Annual fees range from $10,100 to $15,300. UniSIM: This year's accountancy students will pay about $33,000 for the entire degree programme, while students from other programmes will pay about $31,000. FINANCIAL HELP NUS: It has a wide range of scholarships and financial aid available. Over the past five years, it has seen a two-fold increase in students receiving scholarships, from about 800 in 2009 to 1,650 in 2013. There was a 60 per cent increase in the number of students receiving bursaries over the same period. NTU: For the new academic year that starts in August, it will be providing about 500 full-term scholarships, namely the Nanyang Scholarship and College Scholarship. Singaporean students interested in taking up a bursary each will receive assistance as long as their household per capita income is $1,900 or less per month. SMU: It has a comprehensive range of financial schemes. For scholarships, about 60 per cent of those who apply have been successful in securing a scholarship supported by the university or its donors. SUTD: It offers 173 scholarships and 43 bursaries, excluding government ones. SIT: More than 10 per cent of students are on scholarships or sponsorships by their employers or prospective employers. UniSIM: About a dozen scholarships, such as the SIM University Scholarship, and bursaries, such as the Ministry of Education Bursary, are available to students. STUDENT RESIDENCES NUS: The six halls of residence, four student residences and five residential colleges offer about 11,000 places in all for full-time students. A one-week stay in a typical single, non-air-conditioned room costs between $110 and $130. NTU: Its 18 residential halls house more than 10,400 undergraduates. Rental fees range from $225 to $280 monthly for a twin-sharing room. SMU: It does not have any student residences for local students. SUTD: It has three student housing blocks with a capacity of around 1,100 beds. Depending on the room type, an undergraduate typically pays around $350 to $480 per month. SIT: It does not offer any student residences. UniSIM: It does not have any student accommodation. OVERSEAS EXPOSURE NUS: About 70 per cent of undergraduates have at least an overseas exposure stint, such as summer school or internships. NTU: Some 80 per cent of students get some form of overseas exposure, such as taking classes at a partner university overseas. SMU: About 86 per cent of students have some form of overseas exposure, mainly through student exchange programmes. SUTD: Nearly 60 per cent of undergraduates have overseas experience. SIT: All students taking programmes offered by its partner universities abroad must go for an Overseas Immersion Programme as part of the curriculum. They spend between three and 17 weeks at the home campus of the university. Also, nearly all undergraduates doing SIT's own programmes have gone on study trips and work-study initiatives overseas. UniSIM: Its full-time students must go for an overseas stint during their studies. Currently, they have not started their stints, which may include a work attachment programme or a service learning project.",12.427045554287144

I have a friend who actually transferred from MAE to NBS lol.  Thing is, for a lot of people, A-level grades and poly GPA have little influence on University performance. My A-level grades were CDD but I'm maintaining a first class now lol. So its not impossible.  Maybe for poly people, your poly GPA and uni GPA is more related if your poly course is similar to your university course. But for the rest who are from JC or are from unrelated poly courses, you will never know how they perform in uni.  The process of switching course is very simple. In your first year, take NBS modules as electives, drop some of your cores in order to make space and time for those electives. Score well in those NBS modules and then apply for transfer. Of course, the scoring well part is usually the difficult part. But if you really want it its actually not that difficult. All you need is around the range of B+/A-. You need the range of A-/A. The threshold for a transfer in has increased considerably. You need a ~4.0+ for internal transfer (from biz to acc, but acc to biz is a free deal, gpa less than 3 also can), and 4.5+ from another faculty.  If you are a CCC student who manage to make a come back and get a First Class, then yes, this is the group that may stand a chance. But I daresay not many would be in this category. For poly students in particular, the correlation is very real. Mind you, I was the book prize winner (top student) in certain modules in poly, and I still get B+/A- here despite best efforts. If your poly GPA isn't high enough to get into business, then you are unlikely to score well enough in the same mods to transfer in, unless you work super hard. (And yes, everyone works super work in Year 1) Another hurdle you may face is with effect from 2015, many NBS modules are no longer available as Unrestricted Electives. This is due to some new 2nd Major partnership, and the 'extra seats' we had last time is now given to this group.

Which course of study?Aim for a course that best suits you, rather than enrol in the most lucrative one Tan Eng Chye Prof Tan is deputy president (academic affairs) and provost at the National University of Singapore. PUBLISHED 6 HOURS AGOhttp://www.straitstimes.com/singapor...ourse-of-study The university admissions season is in full swing, and this is an exciting time for students in Singapore. The tertiary education landscape here has expanded significantly, and there are now many varied and interesting pathways for students to choose from, from traditional professional degree courses in medicine or engineering, to music and the liberal arts and science. Many parents I met at the National University of Singapore's (NUS) Open Day last month remarked that they are envious of the plethora of choices their children have, and wish to be young once more. Some of you may have secured multiple offers from different universities in Singapore and overseas, and you will have to make an acceptance decision soon. But how should one decide? Every year, the Ministry of Education publishes the employment rates and median starting salaries of fresh graduates of the different degree programmes offered by local universities. I certainly hope students do not make decisions based solely on data obtained through the Graduate Employment Survey (GES). GES data provides an indication of starting salaries. Starting salaries are but a guide; they neither set the course nor determine one's career trajectory or destiny. In this volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous or ""Vuca"" world, one cannot predict the future or where the lucrative jobs will be. You would therefore want your university education to equip you with broad-based life skills, and develop you with the flexibility and resilience needed to pick up new knowledge, adapt to new circumstances, and exploit job opportunities across a variety of sectors throughout your lifetime of careers. Another consideration is whether and how the university course adds value to your educational journey. Some students (and parents) may look to university rankings as a measure of the strength of a university department. And there are definitely synergies between research and education. If the university department excels in research, and counts world-leading researchers in the field, it is likely that cutting-edge research will filter through to your learning experience. You will have the opportunity to be taught by highly regarded academics, and there will be plenty of opportunities to conduct research under the who's-who in the field. This is particularly valuable if you have a very strong interest in research or academia. Choosing a university that excels in your area of interest may also open up more specialised opportunities, such as advanced facilities, academic opportunities such as overseas study or research trips, as well as internships and employment opportunities with prestigious organisations in the industry. Beyond academic reputation, your choice of university will also affect your life intellectually, socially and professionally. You should evaluate the entire student experience, and whether it will suit you. Find out if the social setting on campus is what you would want to be part of. NUS has, for example, the Yale-NUS College and the University Town Residential College programmes, which offer an integrated living and learning experience, amid a collegial and intellectually vibrant setting. Another distinctive programme is the NUS Overseas Colleges programme, where students get to live, work and study in an entrepreneurial hub such as Silicon Valley, New York City or Stockholm, taking entrepreneurship classes at a partner university while working in promising entrepreneurial start-ups. All universities have carefully developed their own suite of programmes and it is worth your time and effort to find out what is on offer. Talk to the professors, and to current students. Universities hold Open Days and various outreach sessions where you can visit the campus and get first-hand information. The best-ranked university or the programme that offers you two degrees in the shortest duration may sound attractive, but they may not necessarily be what you are looking for.  Some of you may want an intensely academic experience, and to pick up as many degrees in the shortest possible time. Yet others may prefer to develop a broader range of capabilities, to try out new things, or to pursue more varied experiences. You should aim to identify a university and a course that best suits you, and not simply enrol in the most competitive or lucrative course. After all, you will be spending your next three to four years in this programme. For those of you whose grades may not meet the degree programme's published entry requirements, do not give up. All local universities have discretionary admissions schemes. Last year, NUS interviewed a record 1,600 students under the scheme, and admitted 670 students. This scheme allows universities to assess applicants more holistically, and to consider their passions and attributes such as leadership, resilience or entrepreneurial skills or talent in non-academic areas. The good news is that from the next academic year onwards, NUS, Nanyang Technological University and Singapore Management University can take in more students under the Discretionary Admissions Scheme, from 10 per cent of the annual intake currently, to up to 15 per cent. This will enable more students to enter universities on the basis of their strengths and talents, beyond academic performance. There is no perfect university. What is key is to make a considered decision with the resources and information that are available to you. Your degree should help start you on the journey to where you want to go. The knowledge, experiences and opportunities in your university life should also prepare you for life beyond your degree. As a student in Singapore, you will have up to the beginning of June to decide on your offers from most of the local universities. Whatever you eventually decide on, make the most of your university experience because, for many, it will be the best time of your life.",15.14796589939884

Some international students may apply for MOE tuition grants, in return these students will have to work in a singapore company and contribute to our economy. These students working as foreigners will also be paying higher taxes than locals, which in turn translates into money to spend in national programmes.

You may wish to update yourself with what is happening globally, many foreign countries, universities and companies are providing grants, bursaries, scholarships, fellowships to prospective students globally to study in their country, which includes many sinkies whom have benefited from such programmes.many of those sinkies are either buaykan parents got $ send them overseas, or are on scholarship. which reminds me, of the many scholarships offered for singapore, half are meant ONLY for foreigners. the other half got afew meant for locals n the rest for all to fight(thats like 2~3yrs back tho, not sure now) and mind enlightening me what grants other COUNTRIES are offering for foreigners to study in their country? many scholarships offered by priv companies are given to candidates whose parents are related to the company(eg biz partners, etc), often just to boost their portfolioread text in red",15.075554302895643

If you are talking about the population of international students at any given time, then it is definitely more than 20%, due to the movement of students globally across universities. There are no dumping grounds in our universities, each faculties have their own industry and merits.

2016,is|infosys|information systems|comsci|computer science|cs,"DISCLAIMER: I'd like to say that this post is not meant to flame anyone or put a negative spotlight on anyone. The examples I highlighted below are simply the comments/questions that I spotted which inspired me to write this. I wouldn't want to start a discussion about education in Singapore here, nor would this a debate for JC vs Poly. Just a little background about myself - I was a comms student in poly, did pretty average for my GPA (3.5x), missed the uni application in my first year of army, got rejected by NTU ADM last year, finally got a late acceptance letter from ADM this year. So trust me when I say I can empathise with those who are still waiting for their acceptance letter, and why some people are asking certain questions here.Spoiler!Hi guys, care to give your opinions and views on SMU Business VS NUS Statistics?  Which one will have higher demand by employers? The answer to this is simple, ask yourself where do you want to work? MNC? Local startup? The big 4? Starting your own business? Government sector? The 'value' of a degree is only given to by the people looking at it. Even then, there are those companies in each category that would defy the stereotypical hiring policy. So my advice to the poster who asked this question is to define who are your said 'employers' first. If you have no idea where you want to work or which sector of business you want to be in, it might serve you better to understand more about the course to see which specific programme/school/school culture might suit you better rather which degree appeals more to 'employers'. It's better to make an informed choice yourself.Spoiler!Actually, people do look at where you study. I got a couple of friends in HR. They told me that they would also look at the university, course, GPA/grades, modules taken, then any leadership roles regardless of how many years of relevant work experience a person has. Some say they tend to give more priority to old boys/girls, alum, that sort of thing. I'm not saying you're wrong here buddy, and in fact you're correct in saying this! But like I mentioned previously, it depends on where you're applying for work at, what is the company's hiring policy, what are they looking for etc. Comments like this might mislead some to think that this one degree/choice of school will make or break their future. What your friends experienced are the hiring policies of their particular companies they work at, but it's definitely not the same across various companies.There's no 'one size fits all' answer to certain questions. There is also no 'only one single path' to success. Some students don't realise it yet. This is the point that I'm driving at - Students should not be afraid to seek out multiple answers to a single question. There is always more than one way to solve a single question. Isn't that how it is for Math too? There may be one solution given in the answer book but it doesn't mean that that's the only one.If you do not get your university placing in the public schools this year, there are many other options! For poly students, you can take a gap year and work first, try again next year or the year after, like what I was planning to do myself should I not get my placing this year. Work experience ain't a bad idea too. For JC students, you can always take the A's again (like what some here are planning to do), to get a better grade for your dream course on the next application. I had a friend who couldn't get pharmaceutical, retook his A's while serving NS, scored a much better grade and went on to pharmaceutical on a scholarship in the end. If you really want to study this year, then private schools might be a viable idea as well. Yes things might not have gone according to plan for you. You might have been taught your whole life that you must get into NTU/NUS/SMU, or that might have been pressure on yourself. But fact is, if you're not getting in (even after appeal), then it's on you to take your next step forward. You have to keep moving forward in life despite the obstacles you face. If you're really rejected in the end, allow yourself to be sad for a little while, then pick yourself up, make plans, take the next step forward and move on. You might have to take a little detour, but it doesn't mean you can't get there. It's just how badly you want it. I hope this lengthy post written at 3am in the morning would encourage some of you even a little, because I know what it's like to constantly fail at every turn and have life keep pushing you down. If it did, then I'm glad. ",14.016217891681954

To you it may not be so, but it is pretty obvious to others in this thread that the debate you had with renshi is definitely in a way, not civil. Do note that the reason why there are additional base rules in this specific thread, is because of your ridiculous xenophobic comments made in last year's thread. The degree forum have one active moderator now, so if you do not want to rack up infraction points and offending people along the way, my advice to you is to read and reread your posts before you actually post it. This is NOT EDMW where there are minimal barriers to insults. And in before ""online forums are serious business"" - there are lots of people lurking in this thread, no one wants to read posts and posts of senseless arguments Calling courses as dumping ground and calling people names, are definitely not tolerated in this subforum. The same advice applies to everyone in this thread.Case closed.call ppl name i understand, but y call course dumping ground got problem? a course is called dumping ground when it has the largest population, and aside from those actually interested in the course, also accepts the lowest few ppl, whos grades dont meet the mark for the course of their choice.  dumping ground courses exist in all faculties.  also, in prev post, i was merely asking why he got accepted to smu(which i believe was quite hard to get in from my time) but not a dumping ground engineering course in ntu.  and incase you dont understand the meaning of matriculation. pretty sure applying bank loans dont fall under the following description, since its a contract/agreement between the student and the bank.http://www.ntu.edu.sg/Students/Under...s/default.aspxQuote:Matriculation Matriculation is a formal process where a person registers for study at the University and thus becomes a member of the University student community. All students enrolling in NTU academic programmes that lead to the award of a degree must matriculate with the University before commencing their studies. A person's status as a matriculated student will cease when he completes his study and is conferred his degree, or if he opts to withdraw from his study, or when his candidature is terminated by the University. Matriculation carries with it the agreement to abide by University rules and regulations, and codes of conduct. This includes payment of any fees required by the University.  also, highlight keyword for u. marigoldhl wrote: OP NOTE Stop arguing about the usefulness of arts degrees, this is considered out of topic here (not admission related).

I did not do the Singapore A levels but instead studied at an Indian School, here in Singapore. The curriculum I did is a reputed one actually, and NUS only needs my Year 12 results, and not any other exams like SAT, TOEFL etc. My year 12 (equivalent to A levels) grades are good. But, I think you can judge my grades too! Here are my grades, remember the maximum score for each subject is 100! English - 90 ; Math - 92 ; Chem - 88 ; Bio - 86 ; Phy -78 (physics score is bad)  (In the NUS admissions website, it says that the admission committee wants either Bio/Phy..since my bio is better would that be taken into consideration?) So do you think I stand a chance for dentistry? I have volunteer experience at the Science Centre, and have won prizes from two International Essay competitions! I am also a member of Mensa Singapore (High IQ society)! I am extremely passionate about becoming a dentist one day!! Thank you for reading this guys, and expecting your replies soon! The jury is out regarding the comparability of your ""reputed"" qualifications with the Cambridge A levels and whether your superior Biology score will take precedence over your Physics score. One can only presume a good admissions process to consider all facets of a candidate, not cherry picking only the scores which put said candidate in the best possible light. As a side point, I would like to add that the admission of a permanent resident into the Dentistry course is unheard of -- at least in my circle. For the Medicine course I believe there are but a handful of PRs every cohort (3-5). If this ratio is anything to go by, go figure for Dentistry. One pointer though, please do not parade your Mensa membership as though as it were a feather in your cap worthy of excessive display. Doubtless, entry into this select group is contingent upon your god-given faculties, however it in no way displays your conviction, perservance or aptitude for a dentistry course beyond the fact that you are able to make two and two of a logical problem with greater ease than your non-Mensa brethren. Strutting a Mensa badge of honour has lost its awe the same way the prestige of having the word ""Harvard"" haughtily emblazoned across your chest has been lost when people found out it really mean nothing, what with Harvard tees available en masse in online stores of every stripe and colour. Sorry if this paragraph about Mensa came on a little too strong but these are my personal feelings towards this matter, feelings which I'm sure are harboured by not just my person. Ultimately, what I and the other contributors on this forum provide are but speculations; they may, through serendipity, hit the bullseye, or they may only be the daydreams of delusional individuals disguised as sound advice. Chances are, the latter is likely to be true. Bear in mind that only someone from the NUS admissions office is able to provide any semblance of a true answer. Take heed, prepare well for the possibility of an interview if you are ever granted one, steel yourself for the outcome, ponder over alternatives and you will be fine.

2017,is|infosys|information systems|comsci|computer science|cs,"Hi all,  Signing up for an account and posting for the first time as this thread has given me a lot of information and insight into the whole application process.  Actually I have been reading the past few years' threads as well only to realise how I must really buck up on my GPA and thanks to the realisation of how difficult it is to get into uni, I eventually managed to pull up my grades, with lots of stress of course.  Would like to contribute what I can:  Local, CPGA 3.64, 4 sem GPA 3.53, LIR4 10? or 12? Can't really remember.  Applied to:  NUS FASS - application STILL processing NTU HSS - offered third choice Linguistics based on 4 sems, will appeal for PPGA or Sociology  SMU Social Science - application STILL processing  For those wondering, I could only apply with my 4 semesters as my internship was on my 5th semester, so no 5th sem results. For NUS and SMU, they have made it clear to me at the many times I asked that they will not be making a decision based on 4 semesters if I don't meet the cut-off and will wait for the full transcript. As for NTU, their policy is to process with 4 semesters anyway and will make decision based on it.  Thankfully, my 4-semesters GPA somehow got me an interview with Linguistics. I was called up in early April, went for the writing test and interview, and got offered 2 days after my interview. When I went, two girls I spoke to both did not put Linguistics as their first choice. I believe most in the room (about 7 of us) possibly also did not do so and they were processing applications pushed down from other courses.  Just like to ask a few things I didn't see answers for despite stalking this thread quite religiously:  1) Those who got rejected - you guys got explicit rejection letters via email?  2) Those who got FASS interview and writing test - may I know what is it about? I am still hoping to DA into FASS but up till now no calls, pretty much nothing.  3) For the NTU appeal, should I write about how I have improved a lot and actually qualify for both PPGA and Soci with my 6-sems or focus on why I want to tranfer into these courses instead? Also, do you appeal specifically into one course or do they just assume you are appealing for whatever courses you didn't get?  4) Anyone applied for CAPT and have gone for the interview already?  As for DA: I did not have a CCA in school but I actively volunteered outside of school and did take on one very big role in one of the biggest community events in SG. Its way above the average amount that students would volunteer so I am hopeful yet at the same time not expectant. Have not seen a case of someone admitted via DA for community service.  I do think that my application remains processing for both NUS and SMU due to the fact that I am very borderline plus my DA is via community service. They have much better applicants to offer to but I am just praying very hard that at the end of this waiting game is good news.  Some other info that may help:  SMU is appearing to be very generous with their Biz Ad interviews this year as I know 3 people with GPAs ranging from 3.5-3.6 being offered interviews, aka already one step in if they don't screw up the interview. Could help that they come from related courses but I hope this give others in the same shoe some hope! No news is good news!  Cheers everybody! I like the positive vibes going on for the NTU appeals. Hope everybody eventually get to where they belong! ",13.567548494099523

By Mr. Davidktw.  23/03/2012. ================================================= Both NTU and NUS Computing is Good if you are a good student. I don't believe in any local university offer particularly better courses. I graduated from NUS SOC and is a Senior Consultant in a local IT firm on web applications and security deployments. I also full time *nix user from Linux to Mac to Hp UX to Solaris. I don't believe NUS Computer Engineering students are any better or worse, but I do agree their courses are designed to gear towards a different sector in computing such as embedding systems and silicon design from Intel, AMD etc and semiconductors fabrication. But nothing is stopping them from taking more SoC 3rd/$th year modules. Same goes for SoC, you can also opt for engineer modules like I took a year 1 module from mechanical engineer and it still benefit me today even though my work doesn't rely on it. I do Arduino programming and also Solidworks design for my friend. So don't be mistaken that anyone tell you that it is better in any local university. That's my opinion. How much you can benefit from the lectures and tutorial is up to your own initiative. If you are passionate about Computing, then you will be interested to learn more even without lecturers and tutors. The courses merely scratches the surface on the relevant discipline, your work is to do your own research and be passionate about what you want to achieve in the near future. Find something you are good in and improve on that aspect. Google is your good friend, relevant forums is your playground, and tertiary university is your incubator. With 3/4 years there, learn what is taught and venture on your own to go in-depth. Get yourself those internship available to get a taste of the industry standard. These are not taught in universities and only through training on the job. If you want to set a good impression in among your future boss, show that you can be independent and doesn't need spoon feeding. They won't assume you know everything, but they will assume you know what is taught in your university. Get to know some of your seniors and communicate with them as and when possible to have them give you glimpse into what they encounter outside before you do. It will give you good gauge on what to expect in the near future. Everyday the industry expectation is changing, today is Java, tomorrow is Ruby, Python and other emerging languages and technologies. Technology is going real fast, so if you are not street smart enough, you are no better than others around you, then what is your advantages to get employed when going for interviews. These are my 2 cents worth for your consideration. Absorb at your disposal. Cheers. ",13.144370502718468
2017,is|infosys|information systems|comsci|computer science|cs,"geeniee wrote:  I don't think we are complaining about the odds against us as many of us know right from the start that it is harder for us than JC kids. What she is trying to say is that the entire admissions process, even with the grades required, is skewed towards the JC kids.  Some examples: 1) Poly application window is in Feb, basically when we are busiest with our last projects in poly life (poly kids will know this as hell week), we still have to complete our application. I am not sure if it applies to every JC, but I know some JC provide guidance to their students in writing their personal statement if required. Poly - I tried to ask for help, but no one could help me lol. I even went for further ed/career guidance counselling but it seems that I know the facts and the competitiveness better than the counselor. So yes, poly is expecting poly kids to go out and work after poly. (But let's be honest - so many of us still want to move onto uni, public or private) JC kids - you all basically on holiday when expected to make an application.  2) As she mentioned - Open House AFTER our application. When I was NUS' Open Day, I went to the admissions booth to ask about something and there was an Indian father with his son from IB, also asking why is the Open House after their application. Yeah, you could say that we can still find out information on our own, call NUS to ask them about their programs if we are interested etc but aren't we just as much of an applicant and prospective student as the JC kids are... But truth is that they are still looking to recruit JC kids that's why the Open Day is so conveniently dated after their A'Level results are released. (P.S.: IB even earlier, apply in Jan) 3) Considering us based on 4 or 5 sems - NTU considered only my 4-semesters worth of results when making an offer as I could only submit 4-sems at the point of application. I am now appealing to my first choice but as all of us here know, chances are very slim. So my question is - why can't they hold onto their decisions and decide with my full cert? My final sem results literally is my entire year 3 modules because 5th sem roll over to the final sem due to FYP judging. Their explanation is for those with 5 sems, usually not much of a diff by the time 6th sem come, which I agree to some extent, but I believe if the student manage to pull up his grades enough to qualify him for the course he wants, it is doing disservice to his efforts. It is like making a decision based on your prelim results for A'Level kids. I am not complaining about how the odds are against us to begin with. I am just asking for the universities to see all applicants as equal, and given an equally fair shot at being considered. Sorry for the long wall of text - I just want to give you guys some context, which I don't think JC kids would know if not.  ((Tbh, poly kids if you all don't have a preference, there are several engineering is not that hard to go in if you don't mind. GPA 3.4? 3.5? to safely secure a place. 3.4/3.5 should be manageable if you don't slack off too much and put in effort for your assignment/projects, and study for your exams.)) Guys stop arguing here. You just need to work hard whichever path you take that's all.  For myself, I went to Poly, achieved CGPA 3.99/4.00. Doing a SMU Double Degree in Business & Accountancy now and my CGPA is 3.90/4.00 - which is Summa Cum Laude, First Class Honours. And my GPA is obviously higher than quite alot of JC/IB students in SMU, even though I'm from Poly. At the end of the day, stop whining and crying over where you came from. Whether you came from a non-privileged or privileged background, if you did not get a spot in a Local Uni you only have yourself to blame because you did not work hard enough during 'A' levels or Poly.  And Poly students, you know fully well that more spots are allocated to JC students. It's a fact. Move on with it. You know that only the top 10 - 15% of the Poly cohort gets Local Uni admissions. So what if it's not equal, the government has been pushing for an increase in no. of spots allocated to Poly students.  And so what if it's not equal? Being the top 10-15% in poly shows your immense pedigree. Same logic goes to applying for Ivy Leagues with acceptance rates of 1%, you gonna complain to them to ask them to increase their acceptance rate? Or you going to work hard to be part of that 1%? Get over it.  And don't even talk about difference in opportunities because even I wasn't born with a silver spoon myself. Wherever you come from, work hard and succeed.

I have no CCA positions throughout my life and also no stellar CIP records(as I mentioned-have to keep mugging in jc). I don't think I still have chance for medicine =_= Actually I have applied for two attachments to hospitals so as to enrich my experience in the healthcare sector and also beef up my record, sadly both were rejected,one by JC and one by RMG. Through this experience, I'm convinced that I wouldn't fit as a doctor, so I stopped considering medicine. Besides, I'm also worried about the stress of being a medical student and subsequently as a doctor. I have experienced various weird symptoms in my body due to stress since secondary school. From bruxism leading to Temporomandibular Joint Disorders and sensitive teeth, stomachache before exams, to pimple outbreak before As, I am thinking what else would happen to me under the stress in medical school. Even though I have taken steps to relieve stress by exercising or whatsoever, I realised I'm a person who likes to overthink and give myself stress. If so, I think I wouldn't survive in medicine. All in all, do you think I should go for pharmacy instead of medicine? So that 1. I can still help others in a healthcare sector and take time to improve my social skills without killing a life if I were to enter medicine. 2. I can face less stress compared to being in medicine?? (Tbh, I can only visualize myself as a researcher making contribution towards science behind the scene instead of being a front-line person, although I havent had any true research experience lol) 2) Bio vs Chem As mentioned earlier, I liked Bio less in JC because the syllabus is full of micro-level stuff and also cuz of its rigidness (like there's tons to keywords to memorise). I enjoyed Chem in JC more probably because it's easier to learn. In my case, should I apply for chem course instead of bio(life sciences/biological science)?

He just has higher expectations than the general populace when it comes to retaking A levels. Yes,he might not have gotten crappy results,but I can offer an alternative side of the story since I known him during my JC days. During my JC days,I didn't know louie till J2,when my friend invited him over to join us for a game of badminton on a Saturday in our JC. Back then, I only knew louie as being one of the best in maths/chem in my JC and he did well for that in his first A levels,so I was amazed that he was considering of retaking A's  with his results during NS(1yr my senior). He later,told me that he wasn't satisfied with his A levels results,as he hopes to get into pharmacy in NUS.  I lost contact with him,till I finished NS and I was surprised to learn that he took a gap yr after his NS,to volunteer in hospitals and also retake the A levels. I guess at this point of time,girls should be able to empathise with him at the very least,since he went through an extra yr after NS to re-do his A's. In fact,he told me his plans to re-take As this yr,but I advised him not to and to apply for university instead,since it's counter-intuitive to not go into uni,given his financial circumstances.(He can't consider overseas) Though he didn't get to pharmacy(I guess it's pharmacy's loss to not accept him), he got into nanyang scholarship programme,after all the efforts invested. I feel it's a valiant effort,coming from someone who didn't have any tuition,academic guidance during his period of retakes and still managed to make unconventional decisions(that might not seem logical to the majority) that guaranteed his success. Don't judge the book by it's cover,is all I have to say,to anyone who doubts that he doesn't experience emotional pain after each admission cycle. Emotional pain after each admission cycle? This is weird, anyone who did worse than him is suffering worse than him during the admission cycle. He did well to qualify for 95% of the courses in local university, but he is just being bent on getting into Pharmacy.  What Eddie previously meant that Louie was not the most suited person to share his experience about a success story from past failures. An example of a ''real success story'' would be middleofnowhere. He has already been performing extremely well in school, as well in A Levels. But in terms of providing advice to students who are retaking A levels (because they have failed), he will not be able to provide helpful advice. It is not a loss that Pharmacy did not accept him, but he did not fulfil the requirements set by the administration. You mentioned it as a courageous effort of him to retake A levels countless of time despite his financial difficulties, no tuition, etc. But, bear in mind, is he can choose not to retake A levels 4 times and enter Uni straight after NS, but he chose not to. He chose merely because he is obsessed into getting the course he wished to enter. Frankly speaking, from your entire paragraph, what are you trying to conclude? You kept harping on the fact that he retook A levels as if he has no choice, difficult economic situations, people must empathise him, he is really bold in making such decisions, etc.. But, you must not be biased in your opinions just because he is your classmate. I mean, also do clarify what emotional pain that he has to undergo? Being not able to enter Pharmacy, despite having tons of other choices waiting for him to choose from? There are many people out there with so little options to choose from, their emotional pain is far much worse than what he is facing.. Nevertheless, it is great that he finally resigned to his fate and know that he has a slim chance into entering Pharmacy. He should have done that 2 years back, and not clinging on to the hope that he can enter Pharmacy one day. If he had entered any course 2 years back, he can graduate earlier and support his family earlier.",12.903622525388773

From bruxism leading to Temporomandibular Joint Disorders and sensitive teeth, stomachache before exams, to pimple outbreak before As, I am thinking what else would happen to me under the stress in medical school. Even though I have taken steps to relieve stress by exercising or whatsoever, I realised I'm a person who likes to overthink and give myself stress. If so, I think I wouldn't survive in medicine. All in all, do you think I should go for pharmacy instead of medicine? So that 1. I can still help others in a healthcare sector and take time to improve my social skills without killing a life if I were to enter medicine. 2. I can face less stress compared to being in medicine?? (Tbh, I can only visualize myself as a researcher making contribution towards science behind the scene instead of being a front-line person, although I havent had any true research experience lol) 2) Bio vs Chem As mentioned earlier, I liked Bio less in JC because the syllabus is full of micro-level stuff and also cuz of its rigidness (like there's tons to keywords to memorise). I enjoyed Chem in JC more probably because it's easier to learn. In my case, should I apply for chem course instead of bio(life sciences/biological science)? Pardon me for the long post as I didn't really have someone to talk to...Your help is deeply appreciated!!",12.79246745053988
2017,is|infosys|information systems|comsci|computer science|cs,"This post is over 5 years old, I have read it a couple of times.  By Mr. Davidktw.  23/03/2012. ================================================= Both NTU and NUS Computing is Good if you are a good student. I don't believe in any local university offer particularly better courses. I graduated from NUS SOC and is a Senior Consultant in a local IT firm on web applications and security deployments. I also full time *nix user from Linux to Mac to Hp UX to Solaris. I don't believe NUS Computer Engineering students are any better or worse, but I do agree their courses are designed to gear towards a different sector in computing such as embedding systems and silicon design from Intel, AMD etc and semiconductors fabrication. But nothing is stopping them from taking more SoC 3rd/$th year modules. Same goes for SoC, you can also opt for engineer modules like I took a year 1 module from mechanical engineer and it still benefit me today even though my work doesn't rely on it. I do Arduino programming and also Solidworks design for my friend. So don't be mistaken that anyone tell you that it is better in any local university. That's my opinion. How much you can benefit from the lectures and tutorial is up to your own initiative. If you are passionate about Computing, then you will be interested to learn more even without lecturers and tutors. The courses merely scratches the surface on the relevant discipline, your work is to do your own research and be passionate about what you want to achieve in the near future. Find something you are good in and improve on that aspect. Google is your good friend, relevant forums is your playground, and tertiary university is your incubator. With 3/4 years there, learn what is taught and venture on your own to go in-depth. Get yourself those internship available to get a taste of the industry standard. These are not taught in universities and only through training on the job. If you want to set a good impression in among your future boss, show that you can be independent and doesn't need spoon feeding. They won't assume you know everything, but they will assume you know what is taught in your university. Get to know some of your seniors and communicate with them as and when possible to have them give you glimpse into what they encounter outside before you do. It will give you good gauge on what to expect in the near future. Everyday the industry expectation is changing, today is Java, tomorrow is Ruby, Python and other emerging languages and technologies. Technology is going real fast, so if you are not street smart enough, you are no better than others around you, then what is your advantages to get employed when going for interviews. These are my 2 cents worth for your consideration. Absorb at your disposal. Cheers.",12.478906907718216

Prepared so much in the topic but apparently not on the dress code or speaking enough like an ang moh. I was the only one that came in jeans and sneakers while everyone else were wearing formal. Is that overdress or what's to be expected? (I don't get why the email even said smart casual, but I just followed the email...) NTU and NUS completely ignoring me forever. I've gotten so depressed I'm no longer depressed. Perhaps this is one way of curing yourself of depression: where everything becomes a delusion and nothing in life matters anymore. It sucks that everything to form a judgment on someone can just be based on a single event on a single day and nothing else, but well, that's life. You can say there's still time but I just can't take waiting up to 3 agonizing more months later. If anything, the only realistic thing in life that will ever happen is me writing that appeal letter. Before your comments get lost in the sea of comments on this very active forum, let me reply to your rant/concerns. I just want to say that I get you. I totally do. Why? I was once in your position last year. Unknowingly fell into depression during the waiting period from April to May because I waited hopelessly for things that eventually (and obviously) did not come true... Exactly 1 year ago on this date (13 April 2017), I received a devastating offer from NTU — environmental engineering, and that was my last choice. It was supposed to be a celebration, that I received an offer, but it was the absolute last thing I wanted, since it wasn't my first choice, and something that I knew I couldn't accept doing (and was stupid enough to even place it in my choices, ah well).  Subsequently I got rejected by NUS and SMU, because I simply didn't make the cut... With a heavy heart I signed up (late) for private A levels, and as much as I hated the idea of having to retake, having to suffer... I had no choice. I really wanted to prove to myself that I CAN get into local uni. It didn't help when I'm from one of the top JCs, and my friends are moving on happily to overseas unis with unconditional offers, scholarships, or medicine, law, dentistry... you name it. I was utterly alone. And I felt like I was the only loser in my school (and also a disgrace to my school) who had to retake A levels, who couldn't really make the cut for local uni. In the end, ALL my appeals failed. What's new? Reality slapped me hard in the face, and it hurt like a bitch, of course. What could I do? I had to move on. I then spent some time correcting my mindset before I was actually more mentally stable for my exams. But I just have to tell you that you are really doing yourself a huge disfavour right now. Yes you are disappointed, you are not receiving news, everything seems oh so damn hopeless. But self pity will only kill you, as well as the people around you who love and care for you... do know that YOU are not the only one suffering, your family and friends are too! Everything seems bleak right now yes, but once you get that offer, everything will be merry and bright...  For me, I knew that I wanted to go to uni. I spent that one more year not just preparing for retake, but also redefining my goals and aspirations in my life. Also, building on my character. Depression no more! There were many sacrifices made, many times that I felt like hiding in a cave... but I overcame that and grew so much stronger. As long as you YEARN it, you will get it no matter what, because no one can stop you!! So don't even let the demons in your head stop you, please do not give in to depression. No one can help you except yourself. I suggest you try meditation and yoga, those things saved my ass (': And here I am back this year, legitly exactly one year later. I received my offer from NTU business...... It took one more year, but it was so worth it. Although my story might not be the most impressive one, but I've proved to everyone and most importantly myself that if I want something, I'm gonna make sure I get it, even if it means one year later. Because this is my future, and I am the captain of my ship of fate. I hope that you realise this too, be proud of who you are, of your battlescars, failures and experiences. All these will shape you into who you are — a better you. Chin up!! ",14.882358349664864

If you are totally new to programming, having ICT1001 supplement these knowledge such as SQL query statement. ICT1001 doesn't teach how to write stored procedure and other more advanced SQL statement such as left join, right join, union etc, while project if you know these trick, it can decrease the burden of writing inefficient codes. Also freeloader in ICT is another problem, playing taichi and act blur not contributing to project while others doing the project, they use the time to study for class test and exam. Also known as ""being carried"". During exam for the first trimester, some wrote C code in PHP question, PHP code in Python question, Python code in JavaScript. You will have the confusion especially when you do not have the IDE to highlight code error. Yes, it was very obvious many people found memory allocation and pointers difficult for C. However, if you systematically did everything taught in the lecture. There wouldn't have been a problem. This is one of the parts that had to make sense to you.  But there are tons of many online materials that teach the same thing like on geeksforgeeks that approach the same concept from a different angle. Once it concept clicks, however, it's really hard to forget it. I see a of people spend more time complaining that C is really hard than actually trying to understand the concept.  Take me for example, I pretty much skipped reading and writing files lecture but I was assigned the reading and writing for the 1002 project among other things. To be helpful I had to understand the lecture, so I did that on my own time and because of that. I didn't have to 'memorize' reading and writing for the exam because I had first hand experience implementing it in the project and it was pretty much a giveaway when it came out for the exam. For 1004, yes, it felt like a sinking boat if half your teammates were useless. Now you just blamed the teammates. Which means the project itself, isn't that big of a deal for a 4 'non-useless' group. Many groups even had 5 members. How my group did it was there was a Javascript in charge, PHP in charge, SQL in charge. and the last guy designs with CSS and HTML5.  I'm pretty sure there was no need for jQuery. Also, putting CSS and HTML as another 'difficult' factor is laughable. The labs should have drilled some semantic sense into your skull if you had Dr A, so that shouldn't have been a problem There was some overlapping and confusion but hey this is group work and we figured it out. Also, the world isn't perfect someone is bound to be struggling and someone else has to help them out with it. But if time was managed properly, theres really no excuse even for this 1004 project. Did we take the same 1001 subject here? Since when was there a need for Left or Right join for 1001 SQL. All we needed to know was queries and nested queries. Simple stuff. The word union in itself is self explanatory. A 5 minute google would have explained the syntax. Literally everyone got a good grade for 1001 and this is not including those that exempted the subject for prior knowledge. It was a good introductory course and it didn't go too in depth into any topic. Yes, there might be less burden for projects. However, for that whole semester only 1004 needed SQL. It wouldn't have made much of a difference anyway. Freeloaders are a problem everywhere. People have their priorities. Some just want a degree and pass. While it's not right to freeload, its not right to impose your goals onto others. It's not that the freeloaders want to be freeloaders. From my experience, for the 'known freeloaders' if you ask them to do something specific and early enough. They will do it. Just passively remind them. You gotta take the effort to do so. It's people management. If you ask them to do something when tests starts piling up. Thats no good. My approach is to just carry. I learn a lot from carrying. Try it. Even if you are 'alone' in your group. I'm sure your friends from other groups are willing to help. If you don't have friends, thats another problem. Confusion in exam is a lame excuse. I think it happened to me for 1 paper but it was like 2 marks I can afford to give. It's not like you have 2 papers a day. You have 5 papers spread over 2 weeks. I thought the spread was quite nice. The concepts learnt in the different languages are SOO DIFFERENT. Sure, if you accidentally write var something for a python exam, it might be a problem syntactically. But, I have 100% confidence you don't get marked down for such silly mistakes.  Yes, the programming exams have 2 languages per paper. But python and C are SOO different that its an impossible issue. Heck the things you learn in C you probably don't even know how to do it in Python. Java and C++ might confuse some people I understand but 1.5 months of purely working in one language seems enough to get used to the differences.",14.361685817892457

I heard from a senior in fass that 1 module in fass is about 1 lecture & 1 tutorial per week btw. The benefits of smu: 1. You get to interact and actively engage yourself during lessons. 2. More internship and exchange opportunities than nus. 3. Many students take double majors and more % taking double degree. 4. More specialisation tracks. 5. Higher employment and salary on average according to the employment survey. The downsides of smu: 1. Competition in smu is fierce. 2. Less campus life (in terms of hall etc) 3. The % of honours students there is lower than fass as it is harder to achieve honours in smu. 4. Less opportunities to make friends (Depends on your personality) The advantages of fass: 1. Lecture-tutorial style of learning, good for shy students who prefer mugging in a corner 2. Higher % of honours 3. Greater cohort size >> bell curve affects students less 3. You can take double majors too by DA or in the 2nd/3rd year 4. More campus life 5. Can stay in RC/hall etc. 6. For eg. econs is more academic and math inclined 7. World QS ranking The disadvantages of NUS: 1. Must find internships & exchange opportunities via the student (?) office. 2. Heavier and more modules esp for double major students (be prepared). I was offered double majors via DA, I counted 4 more modules for NUS than smu for the same double major combination. 3. More in depth and harder modules than smu (from my senior). 4. Hall/RC life may affect your academics. 5. Less specialisation tracks than smu.  Disclaimer ** What I think is subjective, I don’t mean to offend any NUS/SMU students reading this 😅 This is the summary of my ‘research’ haha xD. I am also deciding between nus and smu. Currently reading some year 1 stuff to see which one I like more I got SMU econs,  NUS FASS DMP and NBS offer tooWow your research is so detailed! Haha  Some things I would like to clarify for the benefit of everyone, which is based on my own knowledge and experience talking to friends across all 3 universities.  First and foremost, please take the employment surveys as a pinch of salt. Your salary won't be guaranteed to be higher just because you are enrolled in a particular university that is reported to have higher gross starting pay. Trust me,  when I was deciding on uni like you guys many years ago, I was affected by the graduate employment survey as well but then after years in uni and finally working,  I realised the survey might be misleading... Just so you know, most of these times when the graduates answer these surveys, the schools don't even check whether the pay you entered is true or not...How much you will get for your starting pay depends on your EXPERIENCE, your GRADES, your NEGOTIATION SKILLS, the ECONOMIC OUTLOOK at that POINT IN TIME,  the INDUSTRY and JOB SCOPE. Which uni honestly doesn't matter, cos all 3 local unis are considered on par to one another in the employers' eyes.  and it's just gross pay. There are other components in a salary package like bonuses and benefits which are not captured in the employment surveys. Some people may have a lower gross pay but may have higher bonuses and benefits (eg more days of leave) than someone with higher gross pay who may have less attractive bonuses and benefits. And many times, these surveys are not even representative of the whole student population as not all 100% of the graduating cohort would have completed the survey. Maybe it's just that small handful of students who did the survey and skewed the data?  regarding the point about students in nus being only able to source for internships from career office... That is not true at all. You can always self source (meaning you apply via websites like linkedin for eg by yourself) Oh and student exchange definitely must apply via student office regardless of whether is it nus ntu or smu... Cos all uni already have a list of overseas exchange partner universities that students can apply to then the student office will facilitate the process lor. The process is more or less the same across all 3 uni de.  And one more thing about nus I thought is worth mentioning, they have this NUS Overseas College (NOC) programme where you get to spend 1 year overseas studying and interning... You get to accumulate overseas work exp and clear modules like exchange as well. And the internships are paid. And there are many countries u can go to via this programme - Europe, Asia, USA. Do look it up. I kinda regretted not going 😭 cos it's such a valuable opportunity esp if u are passionate about entrepreneurship.Even if u are not its fine it's still great overseas exposure and it value adds to your resume! Oh and every school is competitive, not just SMU because regardless of which course or uni you go to, the bell curve is everywhere.  Choose your school based on the curriculum, the non academic opportunities available and the culture. Talk to seniors Or students who are studying in the universities and courses you have in mind to find out more. Talk to the recent students who have just graduated to find out more about the actual employment prospects and salary trends across the various unis and courses.  Hope this helps more people to come to a decision on which school to choose.",14.071087084509415

Nevertheless, do bear in mind that your service to your school/course is not as valuable as say, someone who chose to volunteer in an area that is related to Medicine. For example, working at the pharmacy, volunteering simple first aid services to the elderly in need/staying alone.  4) Universities does not taking into consideration your past in NS, because JC kids who got in would be training to be medical doctors to serve in NS anyway.  You asked for people to rate your chances, and just because many rated it as very low or even impossible, you call people a wet blanket. If anything, you ought to know that prospective Medicine students have to go through 8 rounds of interview (last heard from a year 3 med student herself) to get in, each testing for different values in you. You are not showing me that you are able to take constructive feedback and given the competitiveness of the places for Medicine, you would most likely have failed the interview, if you even get called up.  I hope you see that your chances are as good as impossible, simply because anyone with a GPA of below 3 would NOT stand a chance for ANY courses in ANY local university. Universities admit based on grades, that's why they have a IGP, and very little on your CCA. Heck, even the Ivy League universities who are considerably more open with their admissions policies still have a minimum baseline for SAT results.  Do update us in time to come when you have received a decision from the universities.  Well Said Geeniee! Totally spot on the equally good L1R5. Meatboi96  Just My 2 Cents: I would like to tell you good luck but sometimes its good to take a step back and absorb all the comments in the forums. I don't think that they're trying to be a 'wet blanket' to pull you down but trying to process  some thoughts. From your comments you seemed like a confident person but maybe a little hung onto your past, you may have scored well during O lvls for L1R4 but maybe things happen which caused you to not do well. However consoling yourself that you're the second of your clique doesn't seem to me as a good mindset as you're just limiting yourself. (Staying in your comfort zone.)  Maybe you can try studying for SATs and A lvls for next year or maybe for when you ORD like little by little during the weekends or something. It could be helpful  And you don't have to challenge me about my grades i scored 2.1 G.P.A during poly hahaha Honestly wish you the best for your application ",13.78455767837337

Its not surprising that these people end up getting rejected after being interviewed.

Agreed the point you mentioned regarding how you manage your projects and freeloader issue. Think of it this way, since each student have different priority, if it doesn't affect you, just ignores about them. They paid their school fees,  if they don't learn anything meaningful during the course of study by not even attempt to study or do project, it is at their own disadvantage. In ICT, it is really the experience that counts, the more you do, the more you learn. The true practice oriented degree program provide in Singapore. After all, no point to argue on this kind of topics. In ICT we are 1 big family, so far those I met in my course of study is approachable. Sometime tips can be acquire from the seniors.

Universities admit based on grades, that's why they have a IGP, and very little on your CCA. Heck, even the Ivy League universities who are considerably more open with their admissions policies still have a minimum baseline for SAT results.  Do update us in time to come when you have received a decision from the universities. ",12.83395716666809

Anyway, I'm here to get my chances rated in getting into uni this year. I noticed some of the COP increased and decreased across the Big Three. These are my grades: A for PW, B for GP, BDD/B for my 3H2 1H1 (subject combi is MPC/E) and pass in MTL B. I was working under contract for the 1 gap year as a support/customer service before moving into the admin support and then I resigned end Feb this year to focus on my uni applications. If it helps, I can also give info on my CCA/extra-curricular contributions: I was Student Conductor when I was in my JC's choir, and we did some voluntary works - once at an old aged home and another with single parents and their kids. We also got a Silver Award at the Singapore International Choral Festival 2015 and my JC recognized my efforts with awards for leadership and team (merit and distinction respectively). I'm aiming for either NTU's English/History/Philosophy/NIE Arts Education or NUS FASS. I know my RP is very borderline, but I want to know what are my chances. I also filled up all DA components for all the unis and even applied for SIT and SUSS. Would appreciate the advice from you guys! You can try but I'll be honest, what kills you is the 2 D's for H2. If you were rejected the first time, I will say that it's quite likely the 2nd round may not be much different. I calculated and unless I'm wrong, that's 70RP which is very borderline for a lot of arts course for NTU. NUS FASS eh..I don't think so to be honest. SUSS is probably your best option at this point.

The reason for this is they design the program in such a way that you need to know how to code before enroll to the program. ICT SE and IS is very intensive, beginners will have a hard time to catch up. For example, one of our project is to write a web crawler and do data analysis and come out application(s) in C++, it must complete within 4 weeks. Those who have zero programming background will suffer very badly. The lecture slides only teach you how to sit, but project expect you to fly. We have other project running concurrently, including class test. Once project submission is up, next week (two days later) our first exam paper. ICT student with a different perspective here. Yes the director said that. Yes the deadlines are like that.  But, noone said you can't submit projects early. Also this is university. Anyone who expects projects to be scoped to only what is learnt in lectures needs a wake up call. Also, the fear mongering here is a little overdone. Its all about the aptitude for absorbing information. I know a guy from an unrelated diploma with 0 coding knowledge on track for first class while a 3.6 it diploma person is struggling to pass. I come from a decent secondary school. 80% of my class went to A levels. Majority dont even consider SIT. Those good enough to go to NTU SMU NUS SUTD will go there instead. The students in ICT right now are basically guinea pigs. Its a risk they dont have to take.  For those that don't do well enough probably don't like studying altogether and would rather go to sim for a faster degree or will choose to retake a levels. That leaves us with the ones that do badly for A levels and are desperate to get into a 'local uni' without wasting time. Its not surprising that these people end up getting rejected after being interviewed. Edit: One thing that I need to mention is the program is in NO WAY designed that you NEED to know how to code before coming. Saying so is discrediting the professors that work hard to design the program.  The ramp up is fast I admit, but thats the nature of computer science ask anyone in nus/ntu comp sci or smu is, they will tell you the same thing. The first semester subject starts the knowledge train from SCRATCH. If you don't believe me, ask the famous yanying/guyz92 to send you the first few lectures for 1002, which module title is literally programming fundamentals.  I challenge anyone who has seen that to tell me that its not meant for someone with 0 background in coding. The professors themselves reiterate in the first lecture to tell us not to worry if you have no background because they will teach the basics to you.",12.580120680920631

Thanks whuttt wrote:  Good news for those borderline cases eyeing NUS "" . . . . the plan to award up to 1.25 bonus points (equivalent of one H1 grade) to students applying for their first choice programme. The bonus points, applicable to programmes not requiring a pre-entry interview, will be added to the student’s University Admission Score. "" http://news.nus.edu.sg/highlights/nu...on-initiatives NUS applicants to get bonus points for 1st-choice courses Passion for a field of study will count for admission to the National University of Singapore (NUS) from this year. Those applying for a place at NUS will be given 1.25 bonus points for their first choice - equivalent to going from C to B or B to A in an A-level H1 subject. This applies only to courses where entry is based purely on converting a student's grades into points, and not to courses such as medicine and law where students are assessed on their aptitude and interests through interviews. NUS senior deputy president and provost Ho Teck Hua, who announced the move at a press conference on Monday, said NUS analysis of admission data showed the bonus point can make a difference. ""Let's say one student with 81 points applies for communications as his first choice, and another with 82 points applies to the same course as his second choice. With the 1.25 points, the student who lists the course as his first choice will get ahead of the person with 82 points,"" he said. On why NUS decided on the move, he said: ""If you have done well and are passionate about a career in business or computing, for example, then we want to say to you that we support your passion."" ""We want to help you pursue your passion,"" he said, adding that students passionate about what they study tend to perform better. Professor Ho revealed that, currently, 65 per cent of students given a place in their first-choice course take up the offer, while only 45 per cent of those given their second-choice course do so. Noting NUS graduates' good job prospects, Prof Ho also announced that NUS will be increasing the number of double majors to increase career options for its graduates. ""The nature of work is changing very rapidly, and we need to prepare students for a lifetime of diverse careers,"" he said. He said NUS, which currently offers 94 double major and major-minor combinations, will add another 86 such programmes. ""Someone doing data science and entrepreneurship, for example, can go and work for a range of industries in data science, and also go and do a start-up."" On top of the double majors, NUS also offers 71 double degrees, 33 joint degrees with partner universities and 24 concurrent degrees. Adding all this, currently 15 per cent of NUS students are trained in more than one discipline. Prof Ho said he hopes half of all NUS students will graduate with knowledge and skills in two different fields, so they will have more job offers to choose from. He also announced two new degree programmes for this year, one in pharmaceutical science and the other in veterinary science. Students taking up the 5 1/2-year concurrent veterinary degree programme will graduate with an NUS degree in life sciences and a Doctor of Veterinary Medicine from the University of Melbourne. NUS, which now offers 230 bond-free merit scholarships, will add 200 more scholarships for the new academic year. Ms Geraldine Tan, 19, welcomed the move by NUS and said it is important for young people to get into a field that excites them. She said: ""I really want to study business and maybe go on an overseas college stint as I want to start a social enterprise. Business courses are hard to get into, so I am hoping the bonus points will help me get the edge."" Hwa Chong Institution student Hannah Ganesh, 18, said increasing double degree options is good as students can diversify their learning and ""challenge themselves"".http://www.straitstimes.com/singapor...choice-courses NUS' new offerings BONUS POINTS FOR FIRST CHOICE Students applying to NUS will be given 1.25 bonus points for their first-choice course.

It currently offers 94 double major and major-minor combinations and will add another 86 such programmes. NEW DEGREES A new concurrent degree combines NUS' Bachelor of Science and the Doctor of Veterinary Medicine offered by the University of Melbourne. Students can complete the programmes in 5-1/2 years. NUS is also offering a new joint degree in pharmaceutical science with the University of Dundee in Scotland.

I grew fondly for social science (i.e. psychology) even though I am a poly student who studies accountancy and have a mixture of accounting and business knowledge. 2. I feel that I want to study with a deeper meaning and that it would benefit both society and myself. (I love to make people smile and be happy, thinking on the positive side) 3. I would not only just basically want to study on psychology, I want to expand my knowledge such as taking extra courses that would broaden my career prospects. The above facts are there to briefly describe what are my thoughts now because I do not want to regret choosing the wrong course in the end but still I'm planning to enter a local uni as of now. I would really appreciate any feedbacks or suggestions from any point of view.  Thanks guys!    Hi, im currently a y1 psych student in NTU! I believe NTU/NUS would be a better choice given your goals and aims in life! In ntu, besides taking the psych core mods, many NTU psych majors also take up NIE mods as their minors (such as in counselling, special needs, early childhood, youth pathopsychology, educational psychology and the list goes on HAHA) In nus, i believe there are social work modules that you can take either as a second major, minor or free electives (which seems to suit your passion of helping others!) I feel that SMU is more geared towards business and may not necessarily suits your future career aspirations (not because it's not as good but it doesn't seem in line with your goals) Also, maybe you can take into consideration the environment you work best in and maybe travelling time (because tbh, there shouldn't be that much diff between the 3 uni in terms of prestige- psychology in the 3 uni aren't ranked very highly in the world actually- most of my coursemates would love to enrol in overseas uni if they got the $$$)  also, I am not in the position to speak for poly students since Im from the JC route (so im not very sure ^^""; all I know is that NUS FASS cop is BBC/B and NTU psych cop is AAC/C to apply; I didnt apply to SMU psych- however, i heard it's based more on interviews rather than just your rp like for NTU/NUS? Im not very sure) Actually, you may also consider that NTU psych is a direct honours track, and direct honours is basically what it is; however, if you are not planning to take masters (in which having honours makes it easier to), you should save your money and just go NUS FASS (3 years if you cant/dont want to get honours) Hope this helps!

I think the whole “3 vs 4 years” debate comes up every intake, and it’s easy to think linearly and say that NBS > SMU Biz/Acc. However, would like to point out that: 1) Depending on the number of exemptions, one may be able to complete the program in 3 or 3.5 years, rather than four. 2) SMU’s curriculum is more holistic in that you don’t just take courses specific to your domain, but are able to take a second major to learn a complementary discipline (ie Accounting w/ second major in Finance or Finance w/ a second major in Economics, and there are so many other combinations as well). The core modules also address topics that are quite pertinent to self-improvement, which I think is beneficial.  3) SMU is a management school, and so you get a number of inherent advantages from studying Biz/Acc here. The emphasis on corporate skills, the professors, the school culture, and the proximity to the CBD all contribute to making students more effective management professionals.  4) SMU may not be known for the hostel experience, but the vibrancy of the CCAs more than makes up for it.  Ultimately, I believe the choice has to made by oneself. But I do think the preceding points could definitely aid in one’s research to see what best fits him or her.

You can graduate faster in 3 years and start working earlier, but 4 years lets you do more internships and take more modules. Up to individual preference. 2) The nbs second major is severely limited. It is almost impossible to do a non-traditional second major because you only have 3 years to graduate and very few units for electives. 3) Contrary to popular belief, nbs is not well-known outside Singapore at all , although the ntu brand does have some mileage in asia. 4) CCA is a moot point becauase all unis have CCAs. However, it is true that hall life may be an important consideration for some applicants. And lastly, SMU has way better career services because: - They are located in the city, it is easy to get companies to come down or to get students to attend talks - Because they are located in the city, it is also easy for their students to do part-time internships - They have a much stronger alumni network - Their career service office is much more pro-active than nbs The nbs career office always jokes about how smu students are only good at talking/presentation.

I really hope to get into NUS IS (I am interested in the modules offered) but no news till now so I am already prepared to face the worst scenario. I did receive an offer from SMU so I still got Plan B.  However, SMU school fees is higher than NUS by over 10k, which really makes me think whether should I take up SMU offer.  Personally, I like both SMU and NUS but school fees is really a factor that I must take into account of. Moreover, I do not have an extensive knowledge on how SMU IS curriculum. I wonder is it the same as NUS? or does it differ a lot?  So if NUS rejects me this year, I intend to reject SMU offer, and apply next year to NUS. The reason being university will no longer take into account of O Level result from Y2020 onwards. I was a PFP student and does not have an O Level result thus the long wait or possible rejection from NUS. So I would like to ask what are some of your thoughts on this?  1) Should I reject SMU this year and apply for NUS next year?  2) Do I stand a higher chance in getting accepted if I apply next year? (My CGPA is above 3.9)  Thank you everyone for reading this long post lol just wanna listen to some of your advices/opinions. Thanks! Hi! I'm in similar situation. I graduated in 2017, coming from relevant Diploma with Merit CGPA 3.95.  I'm a PFP student as well but I do not meet the maths requirement. Thus, I've been trying DA as I have good CCA records (I won several awards in local IT competitions, represented SG in international competition before, worked as freelance developer as well as startup biz as well). I got invited for DA in 2017, but didn't manage to secure a spot. Applied last year & was rejected without interview and this year is my last year of applying as I managed to disrupt from National Service (I enlisted late). I currently accepted NTU Computer Science. I'm thinking whether to take a gap year to take O Level Maths to increase my chance as well as from Y2020 onwards, O level will not be taken into consideration. However, due to my family circumstances as well as discouragement from friends I most likely will be enrolling into NTU meanwhile just praying for some good news from NUS side. Haha. Are you a male or female?  If you are a male serving NS, You can accept SMU offer first and reapply next year.  I wish you all the best and hope you will get news from NUS soon!",11.12424218875301

But some top students I know are choosing NTU simply because they would rather start doing psych instead of waiting to claim their major. This is the key reason why people flock to NTU. If you have no worries about doing really badly in uni, the direct honors isn't really that important since you can easily qualify it if you hit a certain gpa in NUS (3.0/5.0). NTU honours degree with a really low GPA isn't seen favourably, anyway. So imo, it may not be that important for you. I'm personally leaning towards NUS simply because it's near my place, and I would like to familiarise myself with the clinical psychology department (since NUS offers a Masters). The S/U option for NUS is pretty good too, you can look at your grades and choose which subjects you don't want to count in your gpa. But in NTU, you must choose it before seeing those grades. Most of my coursemates are upset about this as well, but they're probably going to go with NTU.  As I took statistics and intro to psych in poly, amongst other psych modules (duh), I think i'm confident in getting a B and higher? But of course, I am pretty fearful that something may happen during these tests. That's the main thing that is making me doubt my choice at the moment. NUS allows you to S/U a total of 8 modules, twice the number of NTU in addition to being able to wait for results before S/Uing. If I was under the NTU system, I would have S/Ued a sociology module that I got an A for  As for ""doing psych immediately"", I don't see the rush. The two intro modules helps build up a decent foundation and there are general education modules and basket modules to clear anyway. Not to mention, the NUS system allows freedom to explore different kinds of combination.  As for whether NUS or NTU is better, there's not much difference. NUS psych don't care if NTU psych is better or not and I doubt NTU psych cares if NUS is better or not.  I know some friends who rush to clear their psych mods but for the most part, many prefer to spread it out over semesters to not overload. Nobody wants to do statistics 2, abnormal psychology, Biological Psychology, cognitive psychology, developmental psychology and social psychology in one go  The content alone is enough to kill you when you are dealing with bell curves of 70-80 regularly.",11.05761993569368

However, I'm not the most optimistic person about my chances since:  (1) I'm aware of how limited and competitive the opportunities for post-grad in the psych field are in SG, and priority for these opportunities would probably go to those under government (or whatever full) scholarships which I do not have, unfortunately (I guess it is thus very important for me to have excellent grades/portfolio in a said field) (2) my grades for my core mods are pretty mediocre-ish (My grades for the mods as reflected in last sem results comprises an equal number of A & B+ which is roughly average in the cohort) To be very frank tho, I'm quite fine with pursuing something in the direction of counselling/education and that's probably why I'm planning to take several counselling mods in NIE (to declare some minor in NIE) edit: for those who are choosing between the diff uni for psych, honestly, I would you urge you to consider the distance (if you stay close to NUS, just go NUS; vice versa for NTU/SMU). Staying in hall may be fun and all but like, 4 years of it would kinda devoid you of seeing your family regularly which sucks (at least for me, i will sometimes miss them even if its fun to stay in hall).  The minister said every school is a good school anyway (whether you find this sarcastically amusing or not, there's not much disparity in the reputation of the 3 uni in psych), and if you are smart and passionate towards psych, you will somehow excel in it in any of the 3 uni and be prominent enough to stand out.
