There were 11 others with me as well. So we were given a passage and 2 5-marks questions, with 30 minutes to complete the test. I would suggest you manage the time well, 10 min for reading, 10 min for each question. I don't think they'll be using the same passage, perhaps you can tell me your topic after your interview.  My passage was an extract from this rather 'ancient' philosopher's book. About 1.5 pages long with word size of probably 10. The 2 questions are based on the passage, somewhat like GP's comprehension; 1 question asking about the explanation of the content , the other asking for summary of arguments made by the author. I did manage to see how much my peers wrote, and to my horror, many of them wrote at least 1 page for each question. I just answered straight to the point with as much detailed and concise elaborations (probably barely half a page). So if you have the same worry as me, just remember that quality can definitely make up for quantity. At least I know that if I had written 1 page long, my answer will probably be worse off >.< No time for flowery language honestly. Second part was the actual interview by professors. It's a 1-1 interview in the prof's office. As there were 12 of us with 3 profs, they split us up into 3 groups. Most probably in alphabetical order. My name starts with 'A', so I was interviewed first in my group. 3 interviews were carried out simultaneously in various offices. There isn't a time limit per se, so I guess you could ramble on for as long as you prefer. During the interview, my interviewer ran through the process with me first. 3 main questions. 1. Something more academic, based on the written test. So it was like a chance to elaborate on what you've missed out, or for you to clarify on certain thoughts. No hard and fast rule with this. 2. Based on philosophy's fields of study, talk about what interests you in Philo. (It's basically why you chose Philosophy).  3. Elaborate on CCAs, what made you who you are, what changed your beliefs, any turning points in life etc (that kind of questions). Do take note though, the interviewer may refer (many times) to your application, be it choice of courses, CCA, results and what you wrote for discretionary etc. As for my interviewer, it seemed like he took a good look at the hardcopy of my application. Thank goodness I remembered the details of it.  Also, he actually made it very obvious that he's jotting down pointers of what you say from first question onwards, and he will write things that impresses him as you speak. So feel free to share your glorious history with your interviewer (of course it has to have some link with his main questions). Lastly, the interviewer will ask you if you have any queries. Ask something sensible and pertaining to philosophy or the school's pedagogy. You can PM me if you want to know what I asked. The interview process was a rather enjoyable one, semi-formal? We had a nice chat on some aspects of philosophy that I was interested in; and there's really nothing wrong if you're not sure on how to answer the questions. Just make a deliberate pause, at least to look like you're thinking through your answer, and do answer as logically as possible. Fact is, philosophy is based on logic.  Some tips for preparations: 1. Look up some of the famous philosophers and their background. You might kena one of them for your passage. 2. Look through the curriculum, and decide what you're interested in. Wiki is your best friend if you need explanations on the concepts. 3. Be honest with your background, but speak smartly and emphasize on your strengths. They just want to know you better. Best of luck for your interview tomorrow. PM me if you need anything else. Don't worry, the profs are really friendly. I heard much laughter coming from the other 2 rooms while I was in the interview. Hi! The written test was really challenging, it was about Rene. Everything was as expected for the interview portion, thank you so much for your help! I am not sure if I will be able to get in but thanks once again.",13.752187641782706

Cheeyarn, you may wish to take note of the above point^. This reason may prove to be true for some NTU courses. If you really wish to get into NTU, I suggest you re-take subjects you did badly/mediocre in your O'levels and try to score an A.cheeyarn wrote:  Hi, i have really no idea... it has bugging me for quite awhile. I took amaths and economics during my secondary and poly time respectively. I also applied for nus fass for the previous 2 years, but they rejected me too which i dunno why.  Could it be the reason that i am serving ns now? I kinda at a loss about what to do. I dont really wanna go SIM with my gpa! No! In fact, NS should be an advantage especially if you get into command school! (That is also considered a non-accademic achievement) Other awards like best soldier may help too! NS is the best time to talk about your experiences and what made you decide (forgive me if I sound too drama or cliche) on going into that dream course! NTU/NUS/SMU requires students to write more about themselves for the courses they require to get into/why and there is a portion for non-accademic achievements. Remember to fill that up! Don't think it is not important because there are many people with the same GPA as you, so how do they consider applicants? To see if they have any additional talents/achievements they can bring with them outside their GPA!!! I cannot stress this enough, especially if you are from a poly! Also, I feel you about not being able to get into a local university of my choice! I screwed up my admission to get into my several dream courses at various Local U's during the first year because I thought they only look at GPA, and hence I didn't really bother much with the interview/and did not fill my non-CCA achievements. I thought I would definitely secure a place butI was so FRIGGIN WRONG. I felt like I was going to die literally because I couldn't get into a Local U. It was awful because I worked so friggin hard in poly D': Fortunately, I managed to pull myself together and manage to not screw up the second time and got into a local U with a course of my choice  So, DONT GIVE UP BRO. Now that you are closer to ORD, find some time to improve yourself, hunt down your poly lecturer to write you that testimonial letter for your university admission as they will really help. You are a merit holder, I am sure you have worked hard for it and paid attention during leessons. Your lecturers 会给你面子 if you are sincere and ask nicely!   If all else fails, there is always a local university route outside of NTU/NUS and it can be even better than the two.. but I can't say here.. later people will think I am biased towards certain university...

I think you shouldn't get too caught up with reputation right now, it is something that shouldn't take precedence over your interests and your desired career - mainly because it isn't as important as you think it is. I've a senior, an IP student from one of the top JCs who scored straight B's for his A levels did not get called for an interview for his 1st nor 2nd choice at SMU. Fella decided to go to SIM to pursue his studies in a similar field and is earning quite a lot working as a trader for a fund now.  There are a lot of ways you can monetize your degree - as long as you are doing what you want to do you will think of ways to do so. If you're going to do Jap studies but you're interested in Finance, then do take some finance mods if that is possible, join a finance CCA, take up CFA, participate in competitions, write a paper on Japan and show your employer that you are well versed with Jap culture and at the same time highly passionate (and active) in the finance side of things - you will be an amazing hire for a company looking to expand into / their operations in Japan.  It is important for us not to get caught up with the rankings. I cannot stress this enough - at the end of the day, it is who you are, what you've done and how you're working towards your goals that matter, not the reputation of your University.  Just to share: the decision for me was simple back then - I've sorted out my interests, understood what I needed to do... so I picked the one that's closest to where I live  And my parents are both members of KRGH so that made the choice even more obvious! Thanks for the great advice!  I am offered to do Linguistics in NTU, and it's a more attractive offer now especially since I am offered a scholarship there. The truth is, I love languages, and I'm obsessed with Japanese as well. Been learning the language since P5, over 9 years liao. Been exposed to the culture since I was born, so I am very influenced and in love with it. But still, I don't really see the point in doing Japanese Studies.  I am a Tourism/Business student in NP, so I have both business and hospitality backgrounds to fall upon. I am thinking of being a translator/interpreter, but doing Jap Studies would be pointless since I can't just concentrate on just one language. Being an Eng teacher in Japan would be nice as well, and that would require linguistics studies... The worst thing is, both degrees have one of the lowest starting salary among all the degrees, am now hesitating on whether to appeal to NBS instead... :/ cGPA: ard 3.82 O level: L1R5=4, L1R4=6",11.512436941388003

Hey! Congrats on being shortlisted for SMU SIS interview! First and foremost, you can find numerous blogs and forums with information about the interview. That aside, I've just went for the interview on 9th April and have just received an acceptance email today. So I will be actually telling you what to expect for the interview but it may differ. Firstly, it is a group interview which  consists of 2 interviewers (professors) and 6 interviewees including you. Upon arrival, you will be led to a room by current SIS student volunteers where they will brief you through the interview progress. You will then be given 15 minutes to complete a form whereby you have to state specific examples of certain characteristics and traits (eg. Leadership, curiosity etc). On the same form you have to list down 3 questions you wanna ask the professors. Another 15 minutes will be given to you to design (sketch on a black paper) a Web page depending on the case study. Once completed, you will be led to another room where the interviewers will already be seated. One by one, you have to present your design to everybody. Do expect some questions to be asked by the professors pertaining to your design.  Next comes the famous SMU estimation question and you have 4 minutes to write down your answer on a piece of paper. The question I received was, ""How many A4 sized papers are used for exam questions in SMU per semester."" They do not care about your final answer but are more concern on your thought process. So make realistic and sound assumptions before arriving to your final answer. The professors may ask the origin of your assumption. So make sure you know how to explain. Lastly, the interview will end of with a Q&A session whereby questions you have listed on earlier will be answered. Do not list down questions which can be easily found on SMU's website.  Be confident and show your passion towards IS while presenting your ideas. SMU SIS looks for students who are able to analyse problems fast with critical thinking skills. As long as you make an effort to prepare for the interview, you have won half of the battle. With that,  I wish you all the best for the interview",11.311514782810246

NUS cannot choose their specialisation as what they wish, CAP is still a consideration. So far the only subject I have trouble understanding the lecturer is stats, most prof are Singaporean and speak rather well. Also, I survive 80% of my modules without the textbooks, notes are generally sufficient. Lastly, I have more NUS friends regretting not coming NBS instead.

When you graduate from either schools from the same course like mech eng to mech eng, employment will be the same. The school's name will not shortchange you of anything. Want to go with that ""NUS better branding"" thinking then please, be sure to tell your employer from the private sector that, instead of choosing the school with the modules you want to study so that you can score well.

For NTU, that's 4 years for normal students and 3 for biz/acct. If you take longer than the stipulated time to graduate, you will be spending that extra semesters paying in full. However, NTU is gracious enough to still subsidise you at the same rate but this time. Refer here for the prices: -edit-  AFTER subsidy, the price is about 7.8k/year. Before subsidy, its 28.6k/year. Not many people actually realise how much MOE actually subsidises tuition fees. There is no need to repay them, even if you fail your course and drop out half way. However, you can only get tuition grant once in your life. Meaning if you spend 4 years and drop out/graduate. You wont get tuition grant again. 28.6k/year! So much! That's like the tuition fee for an international student already O_O  Thanks for the reply. I still have two more questions, if you don't mind.  1) Do you need to meet a maximum household income requirement to qualify for the MOE Tuition Grant? Because I felt that it is targeted more for ""lower-income"" families, so they can afford to pay the tuition fees. For example, per capita household income of $1k or something like that.  2)  According to this:  htt p://admiss ions.ntu.ed u.sg/UndergraduateAdmissi ons/FinancialAssista nce/Pages/Bursary byNTU.aspx For full-time undergraduates, it seems like the PCI is $950, yet it also says $1900 per month.

There isn't a time limit per se, so I guess you could ramble on for as long as you prefer. During the interview, my interviewer ran through the process with me first. 3 main questions. 1. Something more academic, based on the written test. So it was like a chance to elaborate on what you've missed out, or for you to clarify on certain thoughts. No hard and fast rule with this. 2. Based on philosophy's fields of study, talk about what interests you in Philo. (It's basically why you chose Philosophy).  3.

In fact, NS should be an advantage especially if you get into command school! (That is also considered a non-accademic achievement) Other awards like best soldier may help too! NS is the best time to talk about your experiences and what made you decide (forgive me if I sound too drama or cliche) on going into that dream course! NTU/NUS/SMU requires students to write more about themselves for the courses they require to get into/why and there is a portion for non-accademic achievements. Remember to fill that up! Don't think it is not important because there are many people with the same GPA as you, so how do they consider applicants? To see if they have any additional talents/achievements they can bring with them outside their GPA!!! I cannot stress this enough, especially if you are from a poly! Also, I feel you about not being able to get into a local university of my choice! I screwed up my admission to get into my several dream courses at various Local U's during the first year because I thought they only look at GPA, and hence I didn't really bother much with the interview/and did not fill my non-CCA achievements. I thought I would definitely secure a place butI was so FRIGGIN WRONG. I felt like I was going to die literally because I couldn't get into a Local U. It was awful because I worked so friggin hard in poly D': Fortunately, I managed to pull myself together and manage to not screw up the second time and got into a local U with a course of my choice  So, DONT GIVE UP BRO. Now that you are closer to ORD, find some time to improve yourself, hunt down your poly lecturer to write you that testimonial letter for your university admission as they will really help. You are a merit holder, I am sure you have worked hard for it and paid attention during leessons. Your lecturers 会给你面子 if you are sincere and ask nicely!   If all else fails, there is always a local university route outside of NTU/NUS and it can be even better than the two.. but I can't say here.. later people will think I am biased towards certain university...

This is as unisim graduates have to go through a relevant 6 months internship and more networking opportunities as some of their modules is taken together with part time students who are already working full time. Ntu sociology does offer internship opportunities but from what I was told by the ntu sociology processor during my interview, only about 50 percent will go for it.  5) post-degree education  After working some time, I will be aiming to get a Mba. From what I understand, both degrees are recognised by the big 3 for Mba (hope I am not wrong on this. The info online is quite sparse on this)  My dilemma; to a pick a less reputable but more specialised and relevant degree or pick one that's more reputable and general in nature.  Side note : For those whose first response is to appeal, I have already started on my appealing processes. However, I do have to make a choice between this 2 offers by 2nd June and I do not want to rely on my appeal results in the event it turns sour. I am also not interested in taking a gap year.  Thank you for reading till the end of this post and I look forward to your input. 4) NTU Soci does have internships, but scoring one is rather difficult. Its not that only 50% want to do it. Rather only 50% can actually get it. In terms of employment. NTU soci is at an abysmal 55.8% full-time employment rate. If it was any other course, I would ask you to go to NTU, but since its soci, I think you should think twice about it. Even ADM has a higher full-time employment rate at 61.4%. Source: http://www.moe.gov.sg/education/post...es/ges-ntu.pdf 5)  In terms of post-degree education, NTU would give you a better shot. But on the other hand, you are looking to take an MBA, not any other post-grad course. MBA usually requires candidates to have an excellent work portfolio, so coming from unisim wouldn't really matter. As long as your achievements at work is better than your peers from NTU, you will be granted an opportunity to pursue an MBA in the local institutes here.",10.517456061516237

Right now I am just relying on my SAT score and entrepreneurship ventures. And I can't help but to think that a SAT score of 2110 is not good enough.

I wonder if there are similar cases to mine that made successful applications to SMU. On a less personal note, has anyone been called for SOSS interview?  Hey bro, I wish you all the best. Take a gap year if you must. I understand how you feel when you said that the opportunity cost is too high. 2 years in NS is no joke too. But trust me when I say this - if you are willing to fight hard and explore meaningful opportunities / venture, then the gap year may just very well change your life. Your SAT is fairly well done (so don't put yourself down), as compared to many others that I know of. A friend from Oxford attained a score around that region as well, but of course, if you wanted it to make up for your O levels and GPA then yeah, it needs to be a lot higher. To be very very honest, it will be a tough to get called for an interview (i'm assuming you applied for business since you mentioned entrepreneurship, but a GPA of <3.0 makes it hard for most courses, too).
