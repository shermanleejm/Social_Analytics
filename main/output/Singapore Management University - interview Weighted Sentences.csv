2014,interview,"piggyondemove wrote:  There will be 2 parts to the interview. First off is a written test in some meeting room. There were 11 others with me as well. So we were given a passage and 2 5-marks questions, with 30 minutes to complete the test. I would suggest you manage the time well, 10 min for reading, 10 min for each question. I don't think they'll be using the same passage, perhaps you can tell me your topic after your interview.  My passage was an extract from this rather 'ancient' philosopher's book. About 1.5 pages long with word size of probably 10. The 2 questions are based on the passage, somewhat like GP's comprehension; 1 question asking about the explanation of the content , the other asking for summary of arguments made by the author. I did manage to see how much my peers wrote, and to my horror, many of them wrote at least 1 page for each question. I just answered straight to the point with as much detailed and concise elaborations (probably barely half a page). So if you have the same worry as me, just remember that quality can definitely make up for quantity. At least I know that if I had written 1 page long, my answer will probably be worse off >.< No time for flowery language honestly. Second part was the actual interview by professors. It's a 1-1 interview in the prof's office. As there were 12 of us with 3 profs, they split us up into 3 groups. Most probably in alphabetical order. My name starts with 'A', so I was interviewed first in my group. 3 interviews were carried out simultaneously in various offices. There isn't a time limit per se, so I guess you could ramble on for as long as you prefer. During the interview, my interviewer ran through the process with me first. 3 main questions. 1. Something more academic, based on the written test. So it was like a chance to elaborate on what you've missed out, or for you to clarify on certain thoughts. No hard and fast rule with this. 2. Based on philosophy's fields of study, talk about what interests you in Philo. (It's basically why you chose Philosophy).  3. Elaborate on CCAs, what made you who you are, what changed your beliefs, any turning points in life etc (that kind of questions). Do take note though, the interviewer may refer (many times) to your application, be it choice of courses, CCA, results and what you wrote for discretionary etc. As for my interviewer, it seemed like he took a good look at the hardcopy of my application. Thank goodness I remembered the details of it.  Also, he actually made it very obvious that he's jotting down pointers of what you say from first question onwards, and he will write things that impresses him as you speak. So feel free to share your glorious history with your interviewer (of course it has to have some link with his main questions). Lastly, the interviewer will ask you if you have any queries. Ask something sensible and pertaining to philosophy or the school's pedagogy. You can PM me if you want to know what I asked. The interview process was a rather enjoyable one, semi-formal? We had a nice chat on some aspects of philosophy that I was interested in; and there's really nothing wrong if you're not sure on how to answer the questions. Just make a deliberate pause, at least to look like you're thinking through your answer, and do answer as logically as possible. Fact is, philosophy is based on logic.  Some tips for preparations: 1. Look up some of the famous philosophers and their background. You might kena one of them for your passage. 2. Look through the curriculum, and decide what you're interested in. Wiki is your best friend if you need explanations on the concepts. 3. Be honest with your background, but speak smartly and emphasize on your strengths. They just want to know you better. Best of luck for your interview tomorrow. PM me if you need anything else. Don't worry, the profs are really friendly. I heard much laughter coming from the other 2 rooms while I was in the interview. Hi! The written test was really challenging, it was about Rene. Everything was as expected for the interview portion, thank you so much for your help! I am not sure if I will be able to get in but thanks once again.",13.780719434958751

Cheeyarn, you may wish to take note of the above point^. This reason may prove to be true for some NTU courses. If you really wish to get into NTU, I suggest you re-take subjects you did badly/mediocre in your O'levels and try to score an A.cheeyarn wrote:  Hi, i have really no idea... it has bugging me for quite awhile. I took amaths and economics during my secondary and poly time respectively. I also applied for nus fass for the previous 2 years, but they rejected me too which i dunno why.  Could it be the reason that i am serving ns now? I kinda at a loss about what to do. I dont really wanna go SIM with my gpa! No! In fact, NS should be an advantage especially if you get into command school! (That is also considered a non-accademic achievement) Other awards like best soldier may help too! NS is the best time to talk about your experiences and what made you decide (forgive me if I sound too drama or cliche) on going into that dream course! NTU/NUS/SMU requires students to write more about themselves for the courses they require to get into/why and there is a portion for non-accademic achievements. Remember to fill that up! Don't think it is not important because there are many people with the same GPA as you, so how do they consider applicants? To see if they have any additional talents/achievements they can bring with them outside their GPA!!! I cannot stress this enough, especially if you are from a poly! Also, I feel you about not being able to get into a local university of my choice! I screwed up my admission to get into my several dream courses at various Local U's during the first year because I thought they only look at GPA, and hence I didn't really bother much with the interview/and did not fill my non-CCA achievements. I thought I would definitely secure a place butI was so FRIGGIN WRONG. I felt like I was going to die literally because I couldn't get into a Local U. It was awful because I worked so friggin hard in poly D': Fortunately, I managed to pull myself together and manage to not screw up the second time and got into a local U with a course of my choice  So, DONT GIVE UP BRO. Now that you are closer to ORD, find some time to improve yourself, hunt down your poly lecturer to write you that testimonial letter for your university admission as they will really help. You are a merit holder, I am sure you have worked hard for it and paid attention during leessons. Your lecturers 会给你面子 if you are sincere and ask nicely!   If all else fails, there is always a local university route outside of NTU/NUS and it can be even better than the two.. but I can't say here.. later people will think I am biased towards certain university...  Just request for a PM if you want more info!",12.276695876870702

I think you shouldn't get too caught up with reputation right now, it is something that shouldn't take precedence over your interests and your desired career - mainly because it isn't as important as you think it is. I've a senior, an IP student from one of the top JCs who scored straight B's for his A levels did not get called for an interview for his 1st nor 2nd choice at SMU. Fella decided to go to SIM to pursue his studies in a similar field and is earning quite a lot working as a trader for a fund now.  There are a lot of ways you can monetize your degree - as long as you are doing what you want to do you will think of ways to do so. If you're going to do Jap studies but you're interested in Finance, then do take some finance mods if that is possible, join a finance CCA, take up CFA, participate in competitions, write a paper on Japan and show your employer that you are well versed with Jap culture and at the same time highly passionate (and active) in the finance side of things - you will be an amazing hire for a company looking to expand into / their operations in Japan.  It is important for us not to get caught up with the rankings. I cannot stress this enough - at the end of the day, it is who you are, what you've done and how you're working towards your goals that matter, not the reputation of your University.  Just to share: the decision for me was simple back then - I've sorted out my interests, understood what I needed to do... so I picked the one that's closest to where I live  And my parents are both members of KRGH so that made the choice even more obvious! Thanks for the great advice!  I am offered to do Linguistics in NTU, and it's a more attractive offer now especially since I am offered a scholarship there. The truth is, I love languages, and I'm obsessed with Japanese as well. Been learning the language since P5, over 9 years liao. Been exposed to the culture since I was born, so I am very influenced and in love with it. But still, I don't really see the point in doing Japanese Studies.  I am a Tourism/Business student in NP, so I have both business and hospitality backgrounds to fall upon. I am thinking of being a translator/interpreter, but doing Jap Studies would be pointless since I can't just concentrate on just one language. Being an Eng teacher in Japan would be nice as well, and that would require linguistics studies... The worst thing is, both degrees have one of the lowest starting salary among all the degrees, am now hesitating on whether to appeal to NBS instead... :/ cGPA: ard 3.82 O level: L1R5=4, L1R4=6",11.413017326844262

Hey! Congrats on being shortlisted for SMU SIS interview! First and foremost, you can find numerous blogs and forums with information about the interview. That aside, I've just went for the interview on 9th April and have just received an acceptance email today. So I will be actually telling you what to expect for the interview but it may differ. Firstly, it is a group interview which  consists of 2 interviewers (professors) and 6 interviewees including you. Upon arrival, you will be led to a room by current SIS student volunteers where they will brief you through the interview progress. You will then be given 15 minutes to complete a form whereby you have to state specific examples of certain characteristics and traits (eg. Leadership, curiosity etc). On the same form you have to list down 3 questions you wanna ask the professors. Another 15 minutes will be given to you to design (sketch on a black paper) a Web page depending on the case study. Once completed, you will be led to another room where the interviewers will already be seated. One by one, you have to present your design to everybody. Do expect some questions to be asked by the professors pertaining to your design.  Next comes the famous SMU estimation question and you have 4 minutes to write down your answer on a piece of paper. The question I received was, ""How many A4 sized papers are used for exam questions in SMU per semester."" They do not care about your final answer but are more concern on your thought process. So make realistic and sound assumptions before arriving to your final answer. The professors may ask the origin of your assumption. So make sure you know how to explain. Lastly, the interview will end of with a Q&A session whereby questions you have listed on earlier will be answered. Do not list down questions which can be easily found on SMU's website.  Be confident and show your passion towards IS while presenting your ideas. SMU SIS looks for students who are able to analyse problems fast with critical thinking skills. As long as you make an effort to prepare for the interview, you have won half of the battle. With that,  I wish you all the best for the interview",11.339469113231361
