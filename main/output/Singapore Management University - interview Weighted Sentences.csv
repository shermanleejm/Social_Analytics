So we were given a passage and 2 5-marks questions, with 30 minutes to complete the test. I would suggest you manage the time well, 10 min for reading, 10 min for each question. I don't think they'll be using the same passage, perhaps you can tell me your topic after your interview.  My passage was an extract from this rather 'ancient' philosopher's book. About 1.5 pages long with word size of probably 10. The 2 questions are based on the passage, somewhat like GP's comprehension; 1 question asking about the explanation of the content , the other asking for summary of arguments made by the author. I did manage to see how much my peers wrote, and to my horror, many of them wrote at least 1 page for each question. I just answered straight to the point with as much detailed and concise elaborations (probably barely half a page). So if you have the same worry as me, just remember that quality can definitely make up for quantity. At least I know that if I had written 1 page long, my answer will probably be worse off >.< No time for flowery language honestly. Second part was the actual interview by professors. It's a 1-1 interview in the prof's office. As there were 12 of us with 3 profs, they split us up into 3 groups. Most probably in alphabetical order. My name starts with 'A', so I was interviewed first in my group. 3 interviews were carried out simultaneously in various offices. There isn't a time limit per se, so I guess you could ramble on for as long as you prefer. During the interview, my interviewer ran through the process with me first. 3 main questions. 1. Something more academic, based on the written test. So it was like a chance to elaborate on what you've missed out, or for you to clarify on certain thoughts. No hard and fast rule with this. 2. Based on philosophy's fields of study, talk about what interests you in Philo. (It's basically why you chose Philosophy).  3. Elaborate on CCAs, what made you who you are, what changed your beliefs, any turning points in life etc (that kind of questions). Do take note though, the interviewer may refer (many times) to your application, be it choice of courses, CCA, results and what you wrote for discretionary etc. As for my interviewer, it seemed like he took a good look at the hardcopy of my application. Thank goodness I remembered the details of it.  Also, he actually made it very obvious that he's jotting down pointers of what you say from first question onwards, and he will write things that impresses him as you speak. So feel free to share your glorious history with your interviewer (of course it has to have some link with his main questions). Lastly, the interviewer will ask you if you have any queries. Ask something sensible and pertaining to philosophy or the school's pedagogy. You can PM me if you want to know what I asked. The interview process was a rather enjoyable one, semi-formal? We had a nice chat on some aspects of philosophy that I was interested in; and there's really nothing wrong if you're not sure on how to answer the questions. Just make a deliberate pause, at least to look like you're thinking through your answer, and do answer as logically as possible. Fact is, philosophy is based on logic.  Some tips for preparations: 1. Look up some of the famous philosophers and their background. You might kena one of them for your passage. 2. Look through the curriculum, and decide what you're interested in. Wiki is your best friend if you need explanations on the concepts. 3. Be honest with your background, but speak smartly and emphasize on your strengths. They just want to know you better. Best of luck for your interview tomorrow. PM me if you need anything else. Don't worry, the profs are really friendly. I heard much laughter coming from the other 2 rooms while I was in the interview. Hi! The written test was really challenging, it was about Rene. Everything was as expected for the interview portion, thank you so much for your help! I am not sure if I will be able to get in but thanks once again.",13.780719434958751

Cheeyarn, you may wish to take note of the above point^. This reason may prove to be true for some NTU courses. If you really wish to get into NTU, I suggest you re-take subjects you did badly/mediocre in your O'levels and try to score an A.cheeyarn wrote:  Hi, i have really no idea... it has bugging me for quite awhile. I took amaths and economics during my secondary and poly time respectively. I also applied for nus fass for the previous 2 years, but they rejected me too which i dunno why.  Could it be the reason that i am serving ns now? I kinda at a loss about what to do. I dont really wanna go SIM with my gpa! No! In fact, NS should be an advantage especially if you get into command school! (That is also considered a non-accademic achievement) Other awards like best soldier may help too! NS is the best time to talk about your experiences and what made you decide (forgive me if I sound too drama or cliche) on going into that dream course! NTU/NUS/SMU requires students to write more about themselves for the courses they require to get into/why and there is a portion for non-accademic achievements. Remember to fill that up! Don't think it is not important because there are many people with the same GPA as you, so how do they consider applicants? To see if they have any additional talents/achievements they can bring with them outside their GPA!!! I cannot stress this enough, especially if you are from a poly! Also, I feel you about not being able to get into a local university of my choice! I screwed up my admission to get into my several dream courses at various Local U's during the first year because I thought they only look at GPA, and hence I didn't really bother much with the interview/and did not fill my non-CCA achievements. I thought I would definitely secure a place butI was so FRIGGIN WRONG. I felt like I was going to die literally because I couldn't get into a Local U. It was awful because I worked so friggin hard in poly D': Fortunately, I managed to pull myself together and manage to not screw up the second time and got into a local U with a course of my choice  So, DONT GIVE UP BRO. Now that you are closer to ORD, find some time to improve yourself, hunt down your poly lecturer to write you that testimonial letter for your university admission as they will really help. You are a merit holder, I am sure you have worked hard for it and paid attention during leessons. Your lecturers 会给你面子 if you are sincere and ask nicely!   If all else fails, there is always a local university route outside of NTU/NUS and it can be even better than the two.. but I can't say here.. later people will think I am biased towards certain university...

I think you shouldn't get too caught up with reputation right now, it is something that shouldn't take precedence over your interests and your desired career - mainly because it isn't as important as you think it is. I've a senior, an IP student from one of the top JCs who scored straight B's for his A levels did not get called for an interview for his 1st nor 2nd choice at SMU. Fella decided to go to SIM to pursue his studies in a similar field and is earning quite a lot working as a trader for a fund now.  There are a lot of ways you can monetize your degree - as long as you are doing what you want to do you will think of ways to do so. If you're going to do Jap studies but you're interested in Finance, then do take some finance mods if that is possible, join a finance CCA, take up CFA, participate in competitions, write a paper on Japan and show your employer that you are well versed with Jap culture and at the same time highly passionate (and active) in the finance side of things - you will be an amazing hire for a company looking to expand into / their operations in Japan.  It is important for us not to get caught up with the rankings. I cannot stress this enough - at the end of the day, it is who you are, what you've done and how you're working towards your goals that matter, not the reputation of your University.  Just to share: the decision for me was simple back then - I've sorted out my interests, understood what I needed to do... so I picked the one that's closest to where I live  And my parents are both members of KRGH so that made the choice even more obvious! Thanks for the great advice!  I am offered to do Linguistics in NTU, and it's a more attractive offer now especially since I am offered a scholarship there. The truth is, I love languages, and I'm obsessed with Japanese as well. Been learning the language since P5, over 9 years liao. Been exposed to the culture since I was born, so I am very influenced and in love with it. But still, I don't really see the point in doing Japanese Studies.  I am a Tourism/Business student in NP, so I have both business and hospitality backgrounds to fall upon. I am thinking of being a translator/interpreter, but doing Jap Studies would be pointless since I can't just concentrate on just one language. Being an Eng teacher in Japan would be nice as well, and that would require linguistics studies... The worst thing is, both degrees have one of the lowest starting salary among all the degrees, am now hesitating on whether to appeal to NBS instead... :/ cGPA: ard 3.82 O level: L1R5=4, L1R4=6",11.413017326844262

Hey! Congrats on being shortlisted for SMU SIS interview! First and foremost, you can find numerous blogs and forums with information about the interview. That aside, I've just went for the interview on 9th April and have just received an acceptance email today. So I will be actually telling you what to expect for the interview but it may differ. Firstly, it is a group interview which  consists of 2 interviewers (professors) and 6 interviewees including you. Upon arrival, you will be led to a room by current SIS student volunteers where they will brief you through the interview progress. You will then be given 15 minutes to complete a form whereby you have to state specific examples of certain characteristics and traits (eg. Leadership, curiosity etc). On the same form you have to list down 3 questions you wanna ask the professors. Another 15 minutes will be given to you to design (sketch on a black paper) a Web page depending on the case study. Once completed, you will be led to another room where the interviewers will already be seated. One by one, you have to present your design to everybody. Do expect some questions to be asked by the professors pertaining to your design.  Next comes the famous SMU estimation question and you have 4 minutes to write down your answer on a piece of paper. The question I received was, ""How many A4 sized papers are used for exam questions in SMU per semester."" They do not care about your final answer but are more concern on your thought process. So make realistic and sound assumptions before arriving to your final answer. The professors may ask the origin of your assumption. So make sure you know how to explain. Lastly, the interview will end of with a Q&A session whereby questions you have listed on earlier will be answered. Do not list down questions which can be easily found on SMU's website.  Be confident and show your passion towards IS while presenting your ideas. SMU SIS looks for students who are able to analyse problems fast with critical thinking skills. As long as you make an effort to prepare for the interview, you have won half of the battle. With that,  I wish you all the best for the interview",11.339469113231361

This piece of news is a huge personal blow to me but I decided to share it here despite personal pain because I had benefited from the advice of forumers here (and some who took the time and effort to reply me through PM) and I hope that in turn, through my sharing, it can possibly help another person gain a more complete insight into the uni's application process.   That said, I'm pretty devastated. I think the most infuriating part is not knowing what I had done wrong to be rejected. My GPA sits well within the IGP range and I personally know of people who had a lower GPA than mine but successfully secured a place in Sociology. I can only deduce that my poor O levels spoiled the chances for me. BUT whether it is truly because of this reason, I cannot be really sure - and this is the frustrating part.  What do they use to calculate the O levels component? Is it L1R5 or L1B4?    What should I do now? Can any seniors advise me please? (( I believe they take L1R5. If GPA is not the problem, it could be your interview? Were you called up to attend an interview?  It might not have been a problem with you per se, however, it might be possible that this year, the IGP increased. Note that soci has a small intake, so the IGP can fluctuate quickly each year depending on demand. We will only know in December when the new IGP for this year's successful applicants is released. As for advise, I cant give much. You cant retake your As since its already June. You could try emailing your appeal directly to the soci dept. If you believe that your GPA is high enough then you should emphasise it.  Im not sure if you can still apply for any other private universities at this point in time, I'm not sure when their applications close.",10.397413174601699

I have not been called up for an interview though & my gpa is 3.58 with diploma in biz admin. Also I was wondering despite this failed appeal can I send a reappeal to the dean of admissions and possibly ask for a chance to be interviewed? I did send out an appeal to the Dean of comms during the appeal period but didn't get any response from him. 2. I'm pretty confused with regards to the whole first window second window of appeal thingy. Would help if someone can get back to me on this 3. I'm thinking of appealing to smu biz since the appeal period is still open but I heard from the staff there that whatever accolades u have (I have prev ran my own business as my FYP with healthy profits) is pretty much secondary. Is it really true? In this case how should I draft my appeal letter cus I was pretty much banking on this to get my way into smu. 4. Is there any NTU sociology students out there? I have a placing there but I'm worried that I might not be measure up in terms of the style of assignments being like GP since I came from poly. What kind of assignments do they have and the mode of testings? Thank you guys1. Dont appeal to the Deans directly. Dean level are too high, they dont micro-manage down to the undergraduate admissions level. At most they do get involved in grad students admissions. Try appealing to an Assoc Prof or an Asst Prof.  2. I believe there is only one window of official appeal. Any appeals outside of the NTU system(ie. directly to the prof) would be counted as informal appeals. 4. Soci is essay and exam based.

This piece of news is a huge personal blow to me but I decided to share it here despite personal pain because I had benefited from the advice of forumers here (and some who took the time and effort to reply me through PM) and I hope that in turn, through my sharing, it can possibly help another person gain a more complete insight into the uni's application process.   That said, I'm pretty devastated. I think the most infuriating part is not knowing what I had done wrong to be rejected. My GPA sits well within the IGP range and I personally know of people who had a lower GPA than mine but successfully secured a place in Sociology. I can only deduce that my poor O levels spoiled the chances for me. BUT whether it is truly because of this reason, I cannot be really sure - and this is the frustrating part.

2016,interview,"Which university? Which course of study?Aim for a course that best suits you, rather than enrol in the most lucrative one Tan Eng Chye Prof Tan is deputy president (academic affairs) and provost at the National University of Singapore. PUBLISHED 6 HOURS AGOhttp://www.straitstimes.com/singapor...ourse-of-study The university admissions season is in full swing, and this is an exciting time for students in Singapore. The tertiary education landscape here has expanded significantly, and there are now many varied and interesting pathways for students to choose from, from traditional professional degree courses in medicine or engineering, to music and the liberal arts and science. Many parents I met at the National University of Singapore's (NUS) Open Day last month remarked that they are envious of the plethora of choices their children have, and wish to be young once more. Some of you may have secured multiple offers from different universities in Singapore and overseas, and you will have to make an acceptance decision soon. But how should one decide? Every year, the Ministry of Education publishes the employment rates and median starting salaries of fresh graduates of the different degree programmes offered by local universities. I certainly hope students do not make decisions based solely on data obtained through the Graduate Employment Survey (GES). GES data provides an indication of starting salaries. Starting salaries are but a guide; they neither set the course nor determine one's career trajectory or destiny. In this volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous or ""Vuca"" world, one cannot predict the future or where the lucrative jobs will be. You would therefore want your university education to equip you with broad-based life skills, and develop you with the flexibility and resilience needed to pick up new knowledge, adapt to new circumstances, and exploit job opportunities across a variety of sectors throughout your lifetime of careers. Another consideration is whether and how the university course adds value to your educational journey. Some students (and parents) may look to university rankings as a measure of the strength of a university department. And there are definitely synergies between research and education. If the university department excels in research, and counts world-leading researchers in the field, it is likely that cutting-edge research will filter through to your learning experience. You will have the opportunity to be taught by highly regarded academics, and there will be plenty of opportunities to conduct research under the who's-who in the field. This is particularly valuable if you have a very strong interest in research or academia. Choosing a university that excels in your area of interest may also open up more specialised opportunities, such as advanced facilities, academic opportunities such as overseas study or research trips, as well as internships and employment opportunities with prestigious organisations in the industry. Beyond academic reputation, your choice of university will also affect your life intellectually, socially and professionally. You should evaluate the entire student experience, and whether it will suit you. Find out if the social setting on campus is what you would want to be part of. NUS has, for example, the Yale-NUS College and the University Town Residential College programmes, which offer an integrated living and learning experience, amid a collegial and intellectually vibrant setting. Another distinctive programme is the NUS Overseas Colleges programme, where students get to live, work and study in an entrepreneurial hub such as Silicon Valley, New York City or Stockholm, taking entrepreneurship classes at a partner university while working in promising entrepreneurial start-ups. All universities have carefully developed their own suite of programmes and it is worth your time and effort to find out what is on offer. Talk to the professors, and to current students. Universities hold Open Days and various outreach sessions where you can visit the campus and get first-hand information. The best-ranked university or the programme that offers you two degrees in the shortest duration may sound attractive, but they may not necessarily be what you are looking for.  Some of you may want an intensely academic experience, and to pick up as many degrees in the shortest possible time. Yet others may prefer to develop a broader range of capabilities, to try out new things, or to pursue more varied experiences. You should aim to identify a university and a course that best suits you, and not simply enrol in the most competitive or lucrative course. After all, you will be spending your next three to four years in this programme. For those of you whose grades may not meet the degree programme's published entry requirements, do not give up. All local universities have discretionary admissions schemes. Last year, NUS interviewed a record 1,600 students under the scheme, and admitted 670 students. This scheme allows universities to assess applicants more holistically, and to consider their passions and attributes such as leadership, resilience or entrepreneurial skills or talent in non-academic areas. The good news is that from the next academic year onwards, NUS, Nanyang Technological University and Singapore Management University can take in more students under the Discretionary Admissions Scheme, from 10 per cent of the annual intake currently, to up to 15 per cent. This will enable more students to enter universities on the basis of their strengths and talents, beyond academic performance. There is no perfect university. What is key is to make a considered decision with the resources and information that are available to you. Your degree should help start you on the journey to where you want to go. The knowledge, experiences and opportunities in your university life should also prepare you for life beyond your degree. As a student in Singapore, you will have up to the beginning of June to decide on your offers from most of the local universities. Whatever you eventually decide on, make the most of your university experience because, for many, it will be the best time of your life.",14.495187433335659

OMG now that I think of it I think I really ran out of topic ... And I even blurted ""I don't know what I'm talking about"" The prof was like ""I'm not trying to make fun of you but I think we are talking about discrimination (blahblahblah), but you're pointing out their usefulness"" T_T I think your answer is correct eh, heard that they are not so strict w the interviewees' answers. At least you answered their Q!!! The others in my group also gave very strong and reasonable points to the profs' Q, with news as backup somemore. Wa fk man I feel that I left a bad impression on them, like I'm damn dumb or something I climb out of my bed at 2 am to post this haha.  If I'm the one in the interview i would answer this it's justifiable to discriminate based on race Discrimination in work should't be based on race but rather the person's ability to accept that there's people better than him/her, the person's ability to adapt to the environment and situation. A company with a diverse culture and background will be able to adept to different client based on their background making them feel like home while working with the company. A great team leader or boss will understand that there's always people better than them and their ability to accept them and not be jealous or potentially fearing that they may one day be replacing them will help the company push towards greater height.  As such, there's really no reason to discriminate others based on their race, rather we should be looking at the individual's potential contribution and ability to adept. Because i'm not sure how to understand this, i try to swing the question away. Another way is to provide a agree and disagree argument. You can also try to use points mention by your group such as ""I agree with simon and sam that bla bla bla. To add on to their point...bla bla bla. This shows you are thinking and listening to what others are saying and not just thinking of what to say making you a team player as well As for the age 1.  Age discrimination has and will always be an issue. We used to discriminate the younger generation, thinking they lack the experience to work as productivity as the older generation and being overly sheltered. But as we advance rapidly in technology, shifting towards work automation having machines replacing humans. it makes more sense to hire younger people that's capable of instantly understand how a machine works without much explanation or guidance.  The society is cruel and I simply do not see a value in hiring the older PMET while the younger one are capable of doing much more at half the cost. While hypocrite may suggest that the elderly are gems and should be highly value, they are simply talk the talk and not walk the talk. And as such age discrimination is a fact and it's a problem deeply rooted into society. I just strongly lean towards one side based on what i think. The question no right and wrong 1 la.

The interview ended surprisingly faster than expected - far less than 10 minutes. However, there were no questions related to assess my competency for ACBS, and I guess that these questions are completely the same as single degree interview. Also, I doubt they even know what I actually applied for. So for those who are applying ACBS as well, do rest assure.  Comparing NTU and SMU, I find that NTU is more rigid in the way they conduct their interviews. They seem to have a list of standardized questions to be asked. Whereas for SMU, after I spoken about my attachment in one of the Big 4, the whole conversation was all about the work I did, and how I was able to cope with stress in the environment. Very friendly professors. As such, it is much easier to control your conversation topic for SMU. Again, in my opinion, NTU is more interested in how you can contribute to NTU. Whilst for SMU, the professors really want to know you as an individual. Also, the interviewers in NTU seem to be expressionless; it feels that I was talking to robots, but at the very least they did hold eye contact with me. Both are equally efficient in conducting their interviews nevertheless. Generally agree with Aomatsu.  Just to add on, I went for the ACBS interview back in 2014, because, you know, NS, and the main interviewer was Prof Valerie. We had a rather entertaining conversation and it was more of a chit-chat session than an interview. NTU knows what courses you applied for. She had my application form in hard copy on the table (in full view) and asked me why I applied for REP as my 2nd choice, and only put Accountancy (single degree) as the 3rd choice. Other than that, the main focus was definitely on how I would contribute NTU if they offered me a place/scholarship. Of course I talked about joining some clubs in NBS, my career goals and the various competitions/events at NTU which interest me. They didn't ask me those ""essay"" kind of questions though, but we chatted for around 20 minutes. It was a very light-hearted and enjoyable session and it felt really short in fact. After the interview, the prof invited me to apply for the USP. I also went for the SMU interview (also in 2014) for the double degree programme in Accountancy and Business. I remember being interviewed by Prof Seow and Prof Gary Pan. They seemed really concerned about whether I applied to NUS/NTU and asked me which I would pick if I was offered all 3. It somehow gave me the impression that they were being insecure/desperate. However, I liked the fact that they gave more attention to my hobbies and interests and focused less on academic achievements. I guess this is one example of SMU's holistic admissions process. They were also constantly marketing their school throughout the interview by asking me if I knew that their school of accountancy was ranked xxx in the BYU rankings etc, and kept comparing them to the other 2 unis. What I got out of that interview was that the profs at SMU are really passionate about what they do and that they're incredibly driven especially when it comes to building the school's reputation.  At the end of the day, both are local universities. Employers will lump NUS/NTU/SMU together anyway. So in terms of employability, no difference really.

2016,interview,"SINGAPORE: Three of Singapore's autonomous universities are refining the way they admit students under the Discretionary Admissions Scheme, which looks beyond a person's academic achievements. It comes as the universities prepare to take in more students under the scheme, when the current cap of 10 per cent allowed for discretionary admissions goes up to 15 per cent next year. ADVERTISING inRead invented by Teads National University of Singapore (NUS) is offering 7,000 places for the coming academic year, but it has received four times the number of applicants. While it has started handing out offers to those who made the cut based on their grades, about 1,800 students who did not are undergoing interviews to be considered for discretionary admissions this year. NUS has been evaluating and admitting more students under the scheme over the years. Last year, it evaluated 1,600 students, 400 more than 2014. 670 of them got in, 70 more than 2014. With more students expected to be considered for discretionary admissions, the process at NUS may be refined. Said Professor Tan Eng Chye, deputy president of academic affairs at NUS: “We are evolving; for instance, we have gotten alumni to help us with the interviews. I find that very useful because the alumni have a lot of experience in sizing up people and candidates, and they ask very useful questions. “We also provide more data on what to look out for and if the numbers get to be big, we may decide that maybe we can have sort of a test first - not an academic test per se, but perhaps a test to look at other non-academic aspects of that person. It could be an aptitude test.” Prof Tan added: “Exercising flexibility is one aspect; you also have to be fairly sharp on what to look for - it is not simply: 'OK, meet the numbers.' Our interest is to look for attributes of the applicants that would make the student community more interesting, more diversified, and enhance the interaction within the student community. “Those who can adequately and can eloquently convey their passions and interests - that would be advantageous. But we also have to look out for students who may not be able to communicate as well, but yet they have the potential for us to groom them to be able graduates.” At the Singapore Management University (SMU), discretionary admissions currently form about 5 to 8 per cent of the annual intake. With the higher cap of 15 per cent for such admissions next year, the university will have ""more leeway"" when assessing students. Professor Pang Yang Hoong, vice provost for undergraduate matters and student development at SMU, said: “For SMU, looking at students with other qualifications is not something terribly new because we always been holistic in the way we assess students and their suitability for admission. We will be more flexible. “(We look for) passion, the aptitude for the course for which we are admitting them into. It would also be ideal if students have demonstrated that they are successful to be in time management, that they also possess resilience and the ability to overcome difficult situations. This will help us to assess if that person has got the resilience and the determination to do well in the programme.” SMU is expecting more polytechnic graduates to apply through the discretionary route with the cap being raised to 15 per cent of the annual intake. Nanyang Technological University (NTU) will also ""broaden the criteria"", to give more people a shot at securing a place. It will favourably consider those who possess ""enthusiasm and relevant work experience"". Professor Kam Chan Hin, senior associate provost for undergraduate education at NTU, commented: “Normally, they will look at other achievements that they have - whether in sports, in arts … or even if they are very passionate about community service, leadership. So these are the things that we usually look for. “We are going to encourage all the schools to broaden the criteria, to allow more people who have a very strong passion, to be given the opportunity to be interviewed. We should be more adventurous, open it a bit more and ask more questions, outside of the usual parameters, and if you find somebody who is really very interesting and very passionate … give them a chance.” NTU had evaluated 1,400 students under the scheme last year and about 600 were given a place. All three universities said that even as they exercise flexibility, it is still important for students to show that they possess the ""adequate academic competence"" to go through the rigour and demands of a university education.  - CNA/ms",13.16363725774696
2016,interview,"photobuff wrote: New SMU course: 1,108 vying for 45 placesCombination of politics, law and economics proves a winner; total number of applications up 6% to 14,000 Sandra Davie, Senior Education Correspondenthttp://www.straitstimes.com/singapor...-for-45-places A new degree course at Singapore Management University (SMU) which offers a combination of politics, law and economics (PLE) is a hit with young Singaporeans hoping to land a university place this year. SMU received 1,108 applications for the 45 places in the course, which means about 25 students are vying for every place. The demand for the new course has also led to a rise in total number of applications - 14,000 in all this year, a 6 per cent rise over last year. Earlier this year, when SMU announced the new course, its officials likened it to Oxford University's prestigious politics, philosophy and economics course. It is aimed at giving students a broad understanding of how the world works and will prepare them for a range of careers. Students who had applied for the course said it is an unusual combination since it includes the study of law with economics and politics - and prestigious to boot as it is being offered to only a select group of high-calibre students. Many were also drawn by the fact that the course would prepare them for a wide range of jobs, including in journalism, foreign affairs, public service, consulting and research. SMU provost Lily Kong said she was delighted with the response. She added: ""From all our engagement sessions, it is clear that students, parents and employers recognise the value that the PLE combination of disciplines can bring in preparing graduates who can handle multifaceted careers... ""Through a deeper understanding of how politics, law and economics intersect to shape the world in which we live, we hope to groom a new generation of leaders and thinkers for Singapore."" The 45 students selected for the course will take all three subjects in the first year, before specialising in one of four areas - global studies, distribution and justice, public policy and governance, or choice and behaviour - from year two. Students will also have to go on a 10-week internship during which they will work on a project to find solutions to a real-world problem. SMU said several firms have indicated their interest in offering internships to those on the course. They include the Economic Development Board as well as consultancies like Bain and Company. SMU officials said close to 5,000 of the 14,000 applicants have been shortlisted so far. They will be further assessed via interviews. Professor Kong said that, besides academic results, SMU uses other criteria for admission. ""Exam grades are a valid measure, but they cannot be the sole measure of a student's ability."" The university is the first in Singapore to require all [shortlisted] candidates to attend an interview. It started the practice 16 years ago, when 2,000 students applied to become part of its pioneer batch. Interviews are still required now, although the number of candidates shortlisted for the six undergraduate degree courses has trebled. They are conducted individually or in groups, with professors on the lookout for intellectual curiosity and leadership qualities. SMU said a select group of students - about 1,000 - with strong academic and other abilities were invited to visit the university on ""SMU Discovery Day"" this year. Prof Kong said: ""Our engagement is directed at confirming that they are indeed an excellent match for the education that SMU offers, and for them to confirm that SMU is the university of choice for them."" A-level holder Benedict Lim, 20, who applied for the PLE course, said: ""I have an interest in both (law and economics) and had a hard time picking one, so when I heard about SMU's new course, I jumped at the chance."" He is keen on a broad-based education as he believes it will train him to be versatile and adaptable and enable him to switch careers. ""You know what they say about students having to take on jobs that don't exist today. ""I really do believe that.

2016,interview,"New SMU course: 1,108 vying for 45 placesCombination of politics, law and economics proves a winner; total number of applications up 6% to 14,000 Sandra Davie, Senior Education Correspondenthttp://www.straitstimes.com/singapor...-for-45-places A new degree course at Singapore Management University (SMU) which offers a combination of politics, law and economics (PLE) is a hit with young Singaporeans hoping to land a university place this year. SMU received 1,108 applications for the 45 places in the course, which means about 25 students are vying for every place. The demand for the new course has also led to a rise in total number of applications - 14,000 in all this year, a 6 per cent rise over last year. Earlier this year, when SMU announced the new course, its officials likened it to Oxford University's prestigious politics, philosophy and economics course. It is aimed at giving students a broad understanding of how the world works and will prepare them for a range of careers. Students who had applied for the course said it is an unusual combination since it includes the study of law with economics and politics - and prestigious to boot as it is being offered to only a select group of high-calibre students. Many were also drawn by the fact that the course would prepare them for a wide range of jobs, including in journalism, foreign affairs, public service, consulting and research. SMU provost Lily Kong said she was delighted with the response. She added: ""From all our engagement sessions, it is clear that students, parents and employers recognise the value that the PLE combination of disciplines can bring in preparing graduates who can handle multifaceted careers... ""Through a deeper understanding of how politics, law and economics intersect to shape the world in which we live, we hope to groom a new generation of leaders and thinkers for Singapore."" The 45 students selected for the course will take all three subjects in the first year, before specialising in one of four areas - global studies, distribution and justice, public policy and governance, or choice and behaviour - from year two. Students will also have to go on a 10-week internship during which they will work on a project to find solutions to a real-world problem. SMU said several firms have indicated their interest in offering internships to those on the course. They include the Economic Development Board as well as consultancies like Bain and Company. SMU officials said close to 5,000 of the 14,000 applicants have been shortlisted so far. They will be further assessed via interviews. Professor Kong said that, besides academic results, SMU uses other criteria for admission. ""Exam grades are a valid measure, but they cannot be the sole measure of a student's ability."" The university is the first in Singapore to require all [shortlisted] candidates to attend an interview. It started the practice 16 years ago, when 2,000 students applied to become part of its pioneer batch. Interviews are still required now, although the number of candidates shortlisted for the six undergraduate degree courses has trebled. They are conducted individually or in groups, with professors on the lookout for intellectual curiosity and leadership qualities. SMU said a select group of students - about 1,000 - with strong academic and other abilities were invited to visit the university on ""SMU Discovery Day"" this year. Prof Kong said: ""Our engagement is directed at confirming that they are indeed an excellent match for the education that SMU offers, and for them to confirm that SMU is the university of choice for them."" A-level holder Benedict Lim, 20, who applied for the PLE course, said: ""I have an interest in both (law and economics) and had a hard time picking one, so when I heard about SMU's new course, I jumped at the chance."" He is keen on a broad-based education as he believes it will train him to be versatile and adaptable and enable him to switch careers. ""You know what they say about students having to take on jobs that don't exist today. ""I really do believe that. That's why it is best to have a broad-based education, so that you have a broad understanding of issues and how the world works.""",12.844284130182803

2016,interview,"Mistwald04 wrote:  I understand what you mean, just that your post got me thinking. For the applicants using UAS for admission, maybe the people behind the scene needs to consider both the UAS and the ranking of choices. (E.g. If B who obtain UAS of 75 put Course X as first choice and C who obtain UAS of 80 put Course X as second choice, who should be admitted?) This is just a simple scenario but imagine there are many more cases like this. The admission office is not the one who make the final decision and each application needs to circulate through the different faculties? For those non quantifiable components, computer will not be able to do the job and the profs need to go through one by one to see who deserve an interview. But the most important point is that in this working society, people procrastinate. No one will be sitting there 8 hrs a day to deal with applications only. Most likely have some coffee breaks in between or chit chat or do other stuff while dealing with the mountains of applications.ChocolateCat wrote:  The non-quantifiable components like CCA, awards, other achievements are only for those who apply through/with non-academic achievements which has a separate 10% quota. The overwhelming majority of applicants is just based on their university admission score - Rank points for JC students, 80% GPA + 20% O's for poly students. This part should be simple sorting. Doesn't matter got 1000 or 10000 applicants.. computer can easily organize it almost instantly what. but yes, my point was it's not as simple as we think. just curious what is going on behind the scenes that is responsible for the delay. In case you missed my other post:  Feel free to correct me if anyone else has more info about this.  I've gotten a variety of answers from all different unis, some giving the politically correct answer of ""equal chances"", however it is indeed true that it is pretty much computerized when they tabulate your scores and your choices. From what I heard from the stuff, if your scores are too far from the cut-off, your application will not be reviewed by the respective faculties. Instead it will end off at the admission committee The admission committee consists of profs from the respective faculties, coming together to evaluate individuals who have applied for NAA or are of borderline. An interview is then held at the faculty for students they are interested in, where they'll write comments for the students, followed by a scoring rubric. This sheet is then passed back to the admission committee to make the FINAL call to give you an offer or not. (At least for NAA I know this is the procedure la). The faculty can only SUGGEST that you're a promising candidate. If you think about it, its the sad truth cause no way are they able to evaluate thousands of applicants manually and in detail, thus they always ask you to list your most important/outstanding qualities first. Appeals are normally quite hard, and is generally for students that have just gotten a new achievement, work experience, sat etc. Hope this helps",12.533238716822778

I did not do the Singapore A levels but instead studied at an Indian School, here in Singapore. The curriculum I did is a reputed one actually, and NUS only needs my Year 12 results, and not any other exams like SAT, TOEFL etc. My year 12 (equivalent to A levels) grades are good. But, I think you can judge my grades too! Here are my grades, remember the maximum score for each subject is 100! English - 90 ; Math - 92 ; Chem - 88 ; Bio - 86 ; Phy -78 (physics score is bad)  (In the NUS admissions website, it says that the admission committee wants either Bio/Phy..since my bio is better would that be taken into consideration?)

I am also a member of Mensa Singapore (High IQ society)! I am extremely passionate about becoming a dentist one day!! Thank you for reading this guys, and expecting your replies soon! The jury is out regarding the comparability of your ""reputed"" qualifications with the Cambridge A levels and whether your superior Biology score will take precedence over your Physics score. One can only presume a good admissions process to consider all facets of a candidate, not cherry picking only the scores which put said candidate in the best possible light. As a side point, I would like to add that the admission of a permanent resident into the Dentistry course is unheard of -- at least in my circle. For the Medicine course I believe there are but a handful of PRs every cohort (3-5). If this ratio is anything to go by, go figure for Dentistry. One pointer though, please do not parade your Mensa membership as though as it were a feather in your cap worthy of excessive display. Doubtless, entry into this select group is contingent upon your god-given faculties, however it in no way displays your conviction, perservance or aptitude for a dentistry course beyond the fact that you are able to make two and two of a logical problem with greater ease than your non-Mensa brethren.

2017,interview,"Hi all,  Signing up for an account and posting for the first time as this thread has given me a lot of information and insight into the whole application process.  Actually I have been reading the past few years' threads as well only to realise how I must really buck up on my GPA and thanks to the realisation of how difficult it is to get into uni, I eventually managed to pull up my grades, with lots of stress of course.  Would like to contribute what I can:  Local, CPGA 3.64, 4 sem GPA 3.53, LIR4 10? or 12? Can't really remember.  Applied to:  NUS FASS - application STILL processing NTU HSS - offered third choice Linguistics based on 4 sems, will appeal for PPGA or Sociology  SMU Social Science - application STILL processing  For those wondering, I could only apply with my 4 semesters as my internship was on my 5th semester, so no 5th sem results. For NUS and SMU, they have made it clear to me at the many times I asked that they will not be making a decision based on 4 semesters if I don't meet the cut-off and will wait for the full transcript. As for NTU, their policy is to process with 4 semesters anyway and will make decision based on it.  Thankfully, my 4-semesters GPA somehow got me an interview with Linguistics. I was called up in early April, went for the writing test and interview, and got offered 2 days after my interview. When I went, two girls I spoke to both did not put Linguistics as their first choice. I believe most in the room (about 7 of us) possibly also did not do so and they were processing applications pushed down from other courses.  Just like to ask a few things I didn't see answers for despite stalking this thread quite religiously:  1) Those who got rejected - you guys got explicit rejection letters via email?  2) Those who got FASS interview and writing test - may I know what is it about? I am still hoping to DA into FASS but up till now no calls, pretty much nothing.  3) For the NTU appeal, should I write about how I have improved a lot and actually qualify for both PPGA and Soci with my 6-sems or focus on why I want to tranfer into these courses instead? Also, do you appeal specifically into one course or do they just assume you are appealing for whatever courses you didn't get?  4) Anyone applied for CAPT and have gone for the interview already?  As for DA: I did not have a CCA in school but I actively volunteered outside of school and did take on one very big role in one of the biggest community events in SG. Its way above the average amount that students would volunteer so I am hopeful yet at the same time not expectant. Have not seen a case of someone admitted via DA for community service.  I do think that my application remains processing for both NUS and SMU due to the fact that I am very borderline plus my DA is via community service. They have much better applicants to offer to but I am just praying very hard that at the end of this waiting game is good news.  Some other info that may help:  SMU is appearing to be very generous with their Biz Ad interviews this year as I know 3 people with GPAs ranging from 3.5-3.6 being offered interviews, aka already one step in if they don't screw up the interview. Could help that they come from related courses but I hope this give others in the same shoe some hope! No news is good news!  Cheers everybody! I like the positive vibes going on for the NTU appeals. Hope everybody eventually get to where they belong! ",13.565324743832468

I have friends studying at NUS Medical and Dental. From their feedback, I share: Both fields attract top JC/Poly grads. Your CCA/Achievements portfolios are what most potential candidates had too. For Medicine: The interviews decide one fate cos almost everyone is RP 90 points. For Dentistry: One's dexterity is tested during the interviews.

Thanks so much for your reply sorry had to make you repeat  But erm I understand the merit part but my reasoning is that even though I have a merit (top 10% of graduating cohort), I don't have stellar GPA. I think this is mostly because I'm from a humanities dip which is more project based so hence more subjective in gradings. I know of friends in engineering with 3.9 GPA but no merit. So if I had a merit in let say a business course, I would have a 3.9 GPA and I believe that would give me a better shot at my course. You know what I mean? haha like there's no fair benchmark here so I tried to emphasise that a little in my appeal and requested for an interview.  I'm not from mass comm but I did talk about my experiences in marketing (i know it's slightly diff from advertising) like big scale projects and internship, as well as skills in designing, video editing etc in my personal statement (for DA) as well as appeal. I even mailed (not email lol) the dean and the programme department lol.  But I guess my chances are slim  maybe my O levels as well, didn't do very well ELR2B2 of 15. But if I had a 3.9 gpa?? Doubt that would make a diff lol. Life. Oh yes Humanities really much harder to score, but yeah glad you realise there's no fair benchmark. I think you can try to bank on your portfolio so far to give you an interview, but just don't hope so much?  Tbh speaking from my friends who were in mass comm, its already hard for them to make it into WKW, even if they meet the cut-off for poly. Not sure why but despite being a very hands-on, practical industry, they still favour JC kids more. I know an acquaintance who was offered scholarship simply because he had good A' Level results. I also have friends, who despite having a good portfolio of experience (internship with big companies, recommendation letter from their supervisors, took on side jobs related to the media), and did not manage to appeal successfully into WKW. But those who were from poly mass comm courses can get up to one year worth of exemption if I did not remember wrongly - on the provision if you get in lol.

You asked for people to rate your chances, and just because many rated it as very low or even impossible, you call people a wet blanket.

From your comments you seemed like a confident person but maybe a little hung onto your past, you may have scored well during O lvls for L1R4 but maybe things happen which caused you to not do well. However consoling yourself that you're the second of your clique doesn't seem to me as a good mindset as you're just limiting yourself. (Staying in your comfort zone.)  Maybe you can try studying for SATs and A lvls for next year or maybe for when you ORD like little by little during the weekends or something.

Agreed on the part for ICT1002 Programming Fundamental, Python is for beginners to learn as var in Python is loosely assign, don't have to care about memory allocation etc. Once student touch C will be another extreme. Memory allocation now is important, assigning var with wrong format and precision will cause C application to crash.

2018,interview,"Hi,friend. May I know roughly how many places are offered for allied health courses? I was rejected by SIT this week, I am not even on the waitlist. I wonder is it worth for me to appeal if the intake for DR is very low. I cant find any information online.dontgiveup wrote:  Hi ! ~  I just wanna say good job to those who completed the interview for SIT allied health whether or not you have succeeded in being accepted.  For those whom will be attending the upcoming Tea Session, you will actually find out that how lucky u r to get it cos the numbers arent exactly very large (particularly RT cos the intake is only about 18 students).  Those who got shortlisted for interview is already considered very good. Because majority of the students would have gotten rejected from the start. And from the interview itself only about 1-2/8 students will get accepted.  So dont feel too upset about it as well.  To those who plans to try again, GO FOR IT! But do prepare your portfolio in the 1 year apart. Because once u have been shortlisted for interview, results and all no longer matters. It is merely about who u r ... interviewers have 0 knowledge or background on u , it is just how u r reacting. It is normal to fail one or two stations, but more importantly is not letting it affect you.  After all , if u want to be an Allied Health professional u have to strong mentally.  The interview gives u a glimpse of school life. In SIT we go by Trimesters, so this mean to say it is definitely more stressful. U will need to write at least an essay per trimester , so be prepared.  Even for those who got accepted, the tip is just PLAY WHILE U CAN NOW.  Just to share a personal story for those who didnt got in :  2017 was the first year this course started , to be honest i found out the minimum GPA for that year from friends who got in ... it was at least 3.7 just for interview.  I attempted as well (i wanted medicine), but i didnt even got shortlisted.  Yes, it is sad to be rejected ( in fact i applied to NTU, NUS and SIT i got rejected for all of them). But what is more important is , what u plan to do.  Getting sad is inevitable , but it doesnt get u anywhere. Why not let it be ur motivation ? Go for shadowing programmes- see if u r really in for it (we have ppl who realised it isnt their thing after getting in). Volunteer - Gain some experience and show them healthcare is for you.  Lastly, for me ... it was hard but as a poly grad i had issues finding jobs even. Eventually, i lowered myself and worked as a hospital patient assistant for a year. No doubt, it was difficult but at the end of it i do learn something.  I made use of my time in the healthcare setting understanding more on it, being look down is common but it makes u a better healthcare professional when u have experience what it is like to be the one being looked down before u become the one ordering people ard.  Eventually i got in and it was a miracle.  So it is not impossible to get in again but of course success is yours only if u have worked hard for it.  So, dont give up if it is really what u want.  And congratulations to those who got in .... ",12.553805139645613

"" http://news.nus.edu.sg/highlights/nu...on-initiatives NUS applicants to get bonus points for 1st-choice courses Passion for a field of study will count for admission to the National University of Singapore (NUS) from this year. Those applying for a place at NUS will be given 1.25 bonus points for their first choice - equivalent to going from C to B or B to A in an A-level H1 subject. This applies only to courses where entry is based purely on converting a student's grades into points, and not to courses such as medicine and law where students are assessed on their aptitude and interests through interviews. NUS senior deputy president and provost Ho Teck Hua, who announced the move at a press conference on Monday, said NUS analysis of admission data showed the bonus point can make a difference. ""Let's say one student with 81 points applies for communications as his first choice, and another with 82 points applies to the same course as his second choice. With the 1.25 points, the student who lists the course as his first choice will get ahead of the person with 82 points,"" he said. On why NUS decided on the move, he said: ""If you have done well and are passionate about a career in business or computing, for example, then we want to say to you that we support your passion."" ""We want to help you pursue your passion,"" he said, adding that students passionate about what they study tend to perform better. Professor Ho revealed that, currently, 65 per cent of students given a place in their first-choice course take up the offer, while only 45 per cent of those given their second-choice course do so. Noting NUS graduates' good job prospects, Prof Ho also announced that NUS will be increasing the number of double majors to increase career options for its graduates. ""The nature of work is changing very rapidly, and we need to prepare students for a lifetime of diverse careers,"" he said. He said NUS, which currently offers 94 double major and major-minor combinations, will add another 86 such programmes. ""Someone doing data science and entrepreneurship, for example, can go and work for a range of industries in data science, and also go and do a start-up."" On top of the double majors, NUS also offers 71 double degrees, 33 joint degrees with partner universities and 24 concurrent degrees. Adding all this, currently 15 per cent of NUS students are trained in more than one discipline. Prof Ho said he hopes half of all NUS students will graduate with knowledge and skills in two different fields, so they will have more job offers to choose from. He also announced two new degree programmes for this year, one in pharmaceutical science and the other in veterinary science. Students taking up the 5 1/2-year concurrent veterinary degree programme will graduate with an NUS degree in life sciences and a Doctor of Veterinary Medicine from the University of Melbourne. NUS, which now offers 230 bond-free merit scholarships, will add 200 more scholarships for the new academic year. Ms Geraldine Tan, 19, welcomed the move by NUS and said it is important for young people to get into a field that excites them. She said: ""I really want to study business and maybe go on an overseas college stint as I want to start a social enterprise. Business courses are hard to get into, so I am hoping the bonus points will help me get the edge."" Hwa Chong Institution student Hannah Ganesh, 18, said increasing double degree options is good as students can diversify their learning and ""challenge themselves"".http://www.straitstimes.com/singapor...choice-courses NUS' new offerings BONUS POINTS FOR FIRST CHOICE Students applying to NUS will be given 1.25 bonus points for their first-choice course.

2018,interview,"Good news for those borderline cases eyeing NUS "" . . . . the plan to award up to 1.25 bonus points (equivalent of one H1 grade) to students applying for their first choice programme. The bonus points, applicable to programmes not requiring a pre-entry interview, will be added to the student’s University Admission Score. "" http://news.nus.edu.sg/highlights/nu...on-initiatives NUS applicants to get bonus points for 1st-choice courses Passion for a field of study will count for admission to the National University of Singapore (NUS) from this year. Those applying for a place at NUS will be given 1.25 bonus points for their first choice - equivalent to going from C to B or B to A in an A-level H1 subject. This applies only to courses where entry is based purely on converting a student's grades into points, and not to courses such as medicine and law where students are assessed on their aptitude and interests through interviews. NUS senior deputy president and provost Ho Teck Hua, who announced the move at a press conference on Monday, said NUS analysis of admission data showed the bonus point can make a difference. ""Let's say one student with 81 points applies for communications as his first choice, and another with 82 points applies to the same course as his second choice. With the 1.25 points, the student who lists the course as his first choice will get ahead of the person with 82 points,"" he said. On why NUS decided on the move, he said: ""If you have done well and are passionate about a career in business or computing, for example, then we want to say to you that we support your passion."" ""We want to help you pursue your passion,"" he said, adding that students passionate about what they study tend to perform better. Professor Ho revealed that, currently, 65 per cent of students given a place in their first-choice course take up the offer, while only 45 per cent of those given their second-choice course do so. Noting NUS graduates' good job prospects, Prof Ho also announced that NUS will be increasing the number of double majors to increase career options for its graduates. ""The nature of work is changing very rapidly, and we need to prepare students for a lifetime of diverse careers,"" he said. He said NUS, which currently offers 94 double major and major-minor combinations, will add another 86 such programmes. ""Someone doing data science and entrepreneurship, for example, can go and work for a range of industries in data science, and also go and do a start-up."" On top of the double majors, NUS also offers 71 double degrees, 33 joint degrees with partner universities and 24 concurrent degrees. Adding all this, currently 15 per cent of NUS students are trained in more than one discipline. Prof Ho said he hopes half of all NUS students will graduate with knowledge and skills in two different fields, so they will have more job offers to choose from. He also announced two new degree programmes for this year, one in pharmaceutical science and the other in veterinary science. Students taking up the 5 1/2-year concurrent veterinary degree programme will graduate with an NUS degree in life sciences and a Doctor of Veterinary Medicine from the University of Melbourne. NUS, which now offers 230 bond-free merit scholarships, will add 200 more scholarships for the new academic year. Ms Geraldine Tan, 19, welcomed the move by NUS and said it is important for young people to get into a field that excites them. She said: ""I really want to study business and maybe go on an overseas college stint as I want to start a social enterprise. Business courses are hard to get into, so I am hoping the bonus points will help me get the edge."" Hwa Chong Institution student Hannah Ganesh, 18, said increasing double degree options is good as students can diversify their learning and ""challenge themselves"".http://www.straitstimes.com/singapor...choice-courses NUS' new offerings BONUS POINTS FOR FIRST CHOICE Students applying to NUS will be given 1.25 bonus points for their first-choice course.

2018,interview,"Hi ! ~  I just wanna say good job to those who completed the interview for SIT allied health whether or not you have succeeded in being accepted.  For those whom will be attending the upcoming Tea Session, you will actually find out that how lucky u r to get it cos the numbers arent exactly very large (particularly RT cos the intake is only about 18 students).  Those who got shortlisted for interview is already considered very good. Because majority of the students would have gotten rejected from the start. And from the interview itself only about 1-2/8 students will get accepted.  So dont feel too upset about it as well.  To those who plans to try again, GO FOR IT! But do prepare your portfolio in the 1 year apart. Because once u have been shortlisted for interview, results and all no longer matters. It is merely about who u r ... interviewers have 0 knowledge or background on u , it is just how u r reacting. It is normal to fail one or two stations, but more importantly is not letting it affect you.  After all , if u want to be an Allied Health professional u have to strong mentally.  The interview gives u a glimpse of school life. In SIT we go by Trimesters, so this mean to say it is definitely more stressful. U will need to write at least an essay per trimester , so be prepared.  Even for those who got accepted, the tip is just PLAY WHILE U CAN NOW.  Just to share a personal story for those who didnt got in :  2017 was the first year this course started , to be honest i found out the minimum GPA for that year from friends who got in ... it was at least 3.7 just for interview.  I attempted as well (i wanted medicine), but i didnt even got shortlisted.  Yes, it is sad to be rejected ( in fact i applied to NTU, NUS and SIT i got rejected for all of them). But what is more important is , what u plan to do.  Getting sad is inevitable , but it doesnt get u anywhere. Why not let it be ur motivation ? Go for shadowing programmes- see if u r really in for it (we have ppl who realised it isnt their thing after getting in). Volunteer - Gain some experience and show them healthcare is for you.  Lastly, for me ... it was hard but as a poly grad i had issues finding jobs even. Eventually, i lowered myself and worked as a hospital patient assistant for a year. No doubt, it was difficult but at the end of it i do learn something.  I made use of my time in the healthcare setting understanding more on it, being look down is common but it makes u a better healthcare professional when u have experience what it is like to be the one being looked down before u become the one ordering people ard.  Eventually i got in and it was a miracle.  So it is not impossible to get in again but of course success is yours only if u have worked hard for it.  So, dont give up if it is really what u want.  And congratulations to those who got in .... ",12.11383068927782
2018,interview,"Poty321 wrote:  Hello there! Totally agree with you that scholarship should not be awarded based on academic performance only, which I did mention in my earlier post. The primary objective of my earlier post aims to encourage individuals who are currently applying/appealing for admission and/or scholarship - through the sharing of my education journey and the challenges experienced as an individual with a disadvantaged background. Subsequently, the post also seeks to highlight the flaws in the basis of selection for the scholarship interview. Today, institutions are still using a uniform assessment method to evaluate people of diverse backgrounds. The assessment for academic potential is pretty straightforward - cGPA, awards, and other academic achievement obtained from other sources (e.g. competitions, courses, etc.). The tricky part lies in the assessment of non-academic components - institutions seek individuals with certain attributes, qualities, and skills (e.g. leadership, teamwork, entrepreneurship, integrity, sports achievement, etc.). And often, institutions only consider school-related activities and/or co-curricular activities as the samples for their assessment.  On a personal note, I believed that those attributes, qualities, and skillscould also beidentified and assessed through employment experience (e.g. customers' testimonials, appraisals by superiors, awards attained, etc.).  In general, institutions should also look beyond the school-related activities and co-curricular activities when assessing the non-academic components of individuals. Hence, granting more flexibility for underprivileged students whose non-academic profile were considered as ""insubstantial"" and thereby allowing  them to have the opportunity to share their stories. Ultimately, an interview is all we need.P.s. I'm glad that your hard work paid off, and congrats on securing that scholarship offered by a private company  (I missed the application deadline for private & government scholarship ) To be shortlisted for interview on the government scholarship with 3.5GPA, you must have some really outstanding non-academic achievements! Do you mind to share with us? And hello senior , assuming you are an SMU student (based on the GPA capped at 4.0). As an individual with similar experience, juggling between full-time work and study is really no joke, not to mention that you are doing it at the University-level and still managed to scored a decent grade. Mind to share what full-time job you work as? Do you study in the day, and work at night/after-school hours? Did you, perhaps, packed all modules into that few days so that you could work for the rest of the days in the week? Sincerely hope that you can share some tips with us/me Networking/cloud computing consultant. And if you can get some really well-known individual in the industry to write recommendation letter would really be helpful.  I think due to my competition award as well as the system I build for one of the major hospital which became part of the national healthcare system.

I grew fondly for social science (i.e. psychology) even though I am a poly student who studies accountancy and have a mixture of accounting and business knowledge. 2. I feel that I want to study with a deeper meaning and that it would benefit both society and myself. (I love to make people smile and be happy, thinking on the positive side) 3. I would not only just basically want to study on psychology, I want to expand my knowledge such as taking extra courses that would broaden my career prospects. The above facts are there to briefly describe what are my thoughts now because I do not want to regret choosing the wrong course in the end but still I'm planning to enter a local uni as of now. I would really appreciate any feedbacks or suggestions from any point of view.  Thanks guys!    Hi, im currently a y1 psych student in NTU! I believe NTU/NUS would be a better choice given your goals and aims in life! In ntu, besides taking the psych core mods, many NTU psych majors also take up NIE mods as their minors (such as in counselling, special needs, early childhood, youth pathopsychology, educational psychology and the list goes on HAHA) In nus, i believe there are social work modules that you can take either as a second major, minor or free electives (which seems to suit your passion of helping others!) I feel that SMU is more geared towards business and may not necessarily suits your future career aspirations (not because it's not as good but it doesn't seem in line with your goals) Also, maybe you can take into consideration the environment you work best in and maybe travelling time (because tbh, there shouldn't be that much diff between the 3 uni in terms of prestige- psychology in the 3 uni aren't ranked very highly in the world actually- most of my coursemates would love to enrol in overseas uni if they got the $$$)  also, I am not in the position to speak for poly students since Im from the JC route (so im not very sure ^^""; all I know is that NUS FASS cop is BBC/B and NTU psych cop is AAC/C to apply; I didnt apply to SMU psych- however, i heard it's based more on interviews rather than just your rp like for NTU/NUS? Im not very sure) Actually, you may also consider that NTU psych is a direct honours track, and direct honours is basically what it is; however, if you are not planning to take masters (in which having honours makes it easier to), you should save your money and just go NUS FASS (3 years if you cant/dont want to get honours) Hope this helps!

I really hope to get into NUS IS (I am interested in the modules offered) but no news till now so I am already prepared to face the worst scenario. I did receive an offer from SMU so I still got Plan B.  However, SMU school fees is higher than NUS by over 10k, which really makes me think whether should I take up SMU offer.  Personally, I like both SMU and NUS but school fees is really a factor that I must take into account of. Moreover, I do not have an extensive knowledge on how SMU IS curriculum. I wonder is it the same as NUS? or does it differ a lot?  So if NUS rejects me this year, I intend to reject SMU offer, and apply next year to NUS.

What are the pros and cons for both schools? I'm not sure about NTU, but I can share some from my perspective as an SMU Accountancy student.Similarities1. Content: NTU and SMU accounting modules are similar according to my NTU Accountancy friends.  More or less the same, but the depth may vary according to the electives taken. 2. Seminar style: SMU has it for all classes. NTU has it, but I'm not sure.3. Exemptions: - For professional qualifications, for SMU, you can get 12 out of 15 exemptions (provided you pass the requisite papers) for ICAEW. - For NTU, I'm not sure, but I've a friend who took advanced tax and (i heard) is exempted from CA Singapore's Tax paper. (Need to confirm.)Differences1. Cost SMU = $11k per annum for 4 years = $44k NTU = $8k per annum for 3 years = $24k Yup the cost difference is quite large (assuming we don't factor in hostel fees).2. Exemptions - This is more applicable if you're a poly student. If your poly's CGPA is >= 3.8, you can get a maximum of 10+ exemptions from SMU. This means you can graduate in 3 years from SMU even without overloading modules. 3. Location - SMU is more accessible, unless you stay in the west then NTU is more accessible.4. Ability to SU modules! - SMU: Has the option to SU two elective modules only when you file for graduation.  - NTU: Can SU some electives according to their website. 5. Graduate starting pay Already mentioned by SiaoLengKeng earlier in this thread, the starting pay for big 4 for both NTU and SMU graduates are similar. $3,000+ for audit.6. Other misc requirements - SMU has a compulsory 80 hours community service requirement + 1x overseas trip requirement. Overall, if we compare just by cost alone, NTU would be better because it is more cost efficient, but if we consider other factors, then there's no uni that's ""better"".

To add on, all the best in your university journey as a year 1 student studying psych in NTU! Really enjoyed the process of exchanging views! Oh, and i forget to add, according to one of my TA (those currently on their path to PhD), to get into clinical and criminal psychology (the two most competitive branch for post-grad), you would first apply for some assistant role under some certified psychologist in that field before you can undertake master's. In both cases, it requires you to be able to analyze and read research papers and calculate/understand the statistical results for the papers (this will be under their technical interviews). Therefore, to successfully pursue a path in clinical or criminal psychology, it is very important to be able to be critical in reading research papers and also being good in your statistics HAHA (i would think both the NUS and NTU psychology do emphasize on this) I would urge you to take on research assistant roles when you enter university to allow you to be more familiar with the roles. Additionally, to kind of understand better which uni you would be more inclined to, FASS openhouse (the second openhouse) would occur somewhere in may if I don't remember wrongly! You can then get a better idea of how psychology is like (you can ask the psych seniors there). Btw I didn't choose FASS psychology not because of any supposed flaws it has in comparison to the other universities, but rather I just feel the FASS open house doesnt send off the right feels for me as NTU's (this is very superficial lel but I feel having the right feels is very important to me)",9.322382487842829

2020,interview,"We haven't had an updated version for some time after the latest GES was released. Now this is one of the kinds of analysis that when interpreting the visualisation you must have in mind a few caveats. Although it is generally advised not to pick a course solely on remuneration, undoubtedly some are willing to sacrifice their happiness working in a field they later find they dislike for a higher pay, and this is their decision.   That being said, this plot is still interesting enough although with a few important things to note:  \- 10% IGP is not the minimum and may be a good measure, but A lvl Rank points does not solely determine the difficulty of entrance for some courses. Especially for courses with interviews, it is quite often the case where the real difficulty lies in passing the interview and not the RP filtering stage  \- For 85 RP courses, it is obvious that quite a few could, and will be greater than 85 RP. This is just a result of the published IGPs holding GP to be a 'C' grade, a decision made by the universities/MOE.  \- This does not take into account non-normal admission like discretionary admission scheme  \- <Honour> variants of the majors were assumed to have the same IGP. If this does not seem to make sense do point out!  \- Horizontal and Vertical lines are the major-wise mean of the courses analysed here. If your major is not here, it must have meant I could not obtain the data for either dimension.  \- One last thing to add is that starting salary is not necessarily the best measure for some majors. For one example, accountancy is known to have lower starting pay but more well-known for its increment/progression.

2020,interview,"   The old National Theatre was the biggest inspiration for the upcoming  Founders' Memorial, as the team behind the design scoured monuments and  icons throughout Singapore's history for ideas during the creative  process.  The new memorial, which honours Singapore's pioneer leaders, will be a  linear building, which features multiple green paths that converge on  an amphitheatre.  The winning design, announced last Monday, was submitted by a team  led by Japanese firm Kengo Kuma & Associates and Singapore firm K2LD  Architects, and won against four other shortlisted designs.  During the brainstorming process, the team said, they were  particularly interested in the old National Theatre as it was an  important landmark in the Republic's history before it was demolished.  ""We were inspired by her beautiful overarching cantilevered roof and  the semi-open seating along the slopes of Fort Canning Hill,"" said the  team in an e-mail interview with The Straits Times.  They also wanted to bring back the spirit of the ""People's Theatre"",  as the old National Theatre was known back then, as a gathering place  for all Singaporeans - and the design evolved to accommodate that  vision.  ""We had multiple iterations of how best to respond to the site and  programme requirements. We went from one memorial slope to two slopes;  one path to multiple paths,"" they said.  ""We also had the idea of the building as a garden, to pay homage to the founders' vision of a garden city.""  The memorial, which sits on a 5ha site in Bay East Garden, seeks to  commemorate the values and ideals exemplified by the late founding prime  minister Lee Kuan Yew and Singapore's first-generation leaders, and  others who played key roles in the nation's early years.  The memorial will have a viewing gallery, a lake, a discovery forest trail, as well as an amphitheatre for gatherings.  The seven-member jury which unanimously selected the winning design  commended it as ""a bold and imaginative new type of memorial which rises  out of the landscape"".     Construction work is expected to start in 2022, with the memorial ready by 2027.  In its heyday, the old National Theatre, located at the corner of  Clemenceau Avenue and River Valley Road, was used for performances,  concerts and conferences.  Designed by local pioneer architect Alfred Wong and opened in 1963,  the 3,420-seat theatre had a distinctive facade with five vertical  diamond-shaped bays and an open-air auditorium with a cantilevered roof.  The theatre was closed in 1984 after it was found to be structurally  unsafe. In 1986, it was demolished to make way for a flyover that became  part of the Central Expressway.  For the upcoming memorial, the team noted it was important that it  creates ""a new dialogue and relationship between the people, nature, and  the city"" where members of the public can gather close to nature, while  looking at the city skyline.  The team, made up of consultants from architecture, engineering and  landscape design disciplines, started work on the project last January.  Mr Ko Shiou Hee from K2LD Architects said the partnership comes  naturally as both firms have collaborated on projects for over seven  years.  ""Being Japanese, Kengo Kuma has a finely tuned sensitivity to local  materials, cultures and expressions. We're familiar with his unique way  of incorporating local elements while reinterpreting with his Japanese  sensibility; a design philosophy that K2LD shares,"" he said.  The team will work with the National Heritage Board and Gardens by  the Bay to ensure the design of the memorial fits cohesively into the  masterplan of the area.  Mr Kuma, design lead of the winning team, said: ""As a marker along  the transformative history of Singapore, I hope the Founders' Memorial  would grow into a living memorial over time, where all Singaporeans can  be inspired amidst the lush gardens for generations to come.""",12.483417182732962
2020,interview,"Read what I wrote about travel bans and how they work.  If you lack reading comprehension, there's no point in continuing this discussion, especially when you continue to throw out random irrelevant points/quotes unrelated to the arguments at hand.  If you do not understand the ways in which basic diplomacy and public health measures work, re-read my recommendations on how you may educate yourself with reliable sources.     To your random quote from Tedros: What Tedros said was true \*at that time given the information they had on hand\*.  And the virus' relatively low spread to the majority of other Chinese provinces remains a fact, when you look at the data on a city-by-city, province-by-province basis.  Outside the epicenter, other Chinese provinces have had relatively low numbers of cases.  In fact, during the early phases of the epidemic (now pandemic) around early-mid February, Singapore had more cases than most other Chinese cities (Singapore was ranked among the top 10 cities - \*including\* all Chinese cities - for confirmed cases).  The virus could have been contained to a much greater extent had \*all\* countries treated the situation seriously as Singapore (and the other major Asian hubs).  Tedros was not wrong in saying that the virus had the potential to be contained and mitigated - however, this containment and mitigation hinged on the cooperation of all countries around the world, and very few countries outside Asia complied with the WHO's recommendations.  For example, if someone assigns you a project and says it is doable - after which you fail to take any steps to research the project and execute on it - it makes very little sense for you to then come complaining that the project is not doable and that the teacher/supervisor assigned an impractical/unrealistic project.  Containment and mitigation was indeed possible, especially at the time Tedros made that statement.  But many countries failed to act.  Singapore government ministers have also acknowledged this point - of the way other countries' inaction have impacted the outcome, despite Singapore's best individual efforts - in interviews.     I reiterate: if you don't understand why countries or international organizations act the way they do, or why epidemiologists make certain recommendations or forecasts, study reliable sources and academic journals.  The field of public health and the field of international studies interact in very interesting ways during a pandemic, and if you are sincerely interested in learning more instead of asking kneejerk rhetorical questions based on skimmed news articles, there are many ways you can actually educate yourself during this time.  (Especially when many academic - particularly public health-related - journals are now free for the general public to access, specifically during this time.  Normally they charge exorbitant access fees to those not affiliated with research/educational institutions - but they have recently waived those fees for the general public due to the pandemic.)",11.66732817103857
2020,interview,"You apply to teach. At the point of application you may indicate whether you wish to be a primary school, secondary school or JC teacher, and which subjects you would like to teach. Ultimately the decision lies with the ministry and you may be given something out of your indicated preferences if it serves the organisational needs better.  You are interviewed. If you clear it you are posted to a school at your assigned teaching level to do a contract teaching stint of 6 months to a year. If your school gives its blessings, you progress on to teacher training.  If you are a degree holder, you go to NIE to get a PGDE (postgraduate diploma in education). You are immediately posted to a school, where your exact deployment will depend on the school's needs. You do not necessarily always start as a lower sec teacher teaching the ""good"" classes. In my first year of service I taught all four levels across various abilities.  The pay is the same for equally qualified and equally well performing teachers across all levels. Your pay will depend on your grade and not whether you are in primary school, secondary school or JC. The only exception is if you're a direct hire in an independent school - meaning you're not within the MOE system and pay structure.  You may be cross-deployed to a different level (e.g. trained in Sec, but move to JC or Pri) at any time, either by request or, rarely, based on some urgent need - this is more common if you teach subjects with smaller cohort sizes and smaller teacher strength. You will not have a pay cut if you move from JC to Pri/Sec or Sec to Pri, unless you are relinquishing a management position like a HOD role.  The salary varies quite a bit after just a few years of service because it depends on the rate of promotion and size of your increments. The salaries upon graduation from NIE are in the region of 4k for dudes and 3.5k for ladies, but you get your first cohort promotion pretty quickly and it's a bump of about 500. The salary is cushy with the bonuses but won't make you filthy rich. The highest monthly salary for a normal teacher who isn't holding a management position or teacher leader position is about 7.8k, and we get on average a 15 - 15.5 month annual package.  The work life depends greatly on your school's staff culture, department culture, and the expectations your reporting officer has of you. I know teachers who work 15 hours a day and I know those who are chilling at cafes or getting pedicures by 4pm. There is no right or wrong but you also have some influence over it - whether you want to 'chiong' for good performance appraisals and fast advancement, or whether you just want to do your job, collect your pay, and be done with the competitive nature of life and work in Singapore for good.  I'm so fucking tired rn, can the March holidays start two days early?",11.170325375408428
2020,interview,"The university admission season is in full swing.  It is timely to reflect on whether admission processes can be improved to manage the increased diversity of prospective university students.  I am a recent graduate from the National University of Singapore’s (NUS) Master of Architecture programme from the polytechnic route.  But I initially faced significant challenges securing a place in local universities, though I came third in my interior architecture diploma from Temasek Polytechnic, one of two diplomas recognised by the Board of Architects Singapore for training waivers.  NUS and the Singapore University of Technology and Design rejected my application and appeals for admission to their bachelor’s degrees in architecture.  My grade point average (GPA) as the third-highest-scoring student was not enough to even land me an interview under a discretionary admissions scheme.  An appeal letter from a Member of Parliament was the saving grace that secured me an interview. I was offered a place in the NUS bachelor’s degree in architecture in 2015 and completed it in 2018. I finished the master’s course last year.  It was disquieting to observe, for instance, that students from Singapore Polytechnic’s environment-design-related diplomas disproportionately dominated the pool of polytechnic students in the bachelor’s and master’s courses in architecture at NUS.  My checks in 2015 revealed that the GPA of the bottom 10th percentile of polytechnic students admitted to the architecture programme was higher than that of the top scorer from my Temasek Polytechnic diploma cohort. This raises the question of whether it is equitable to use the polytechnic GPA as a standard for admission to courses in local universities.     While the A-Level examinations provide a level playing field for junior college students, can we assume that the GPAs between polytechnics are a similar and fair equivalent for our polytechnic students?  Do not get me wrong. This is not a public appeal to increase places for polytechnic students. It is about ensuring that these limited seats go to the best students from the various polytechnics.  Can the Ministry of Education clarify if there are measures to ensure similar levels of rigour in the curricula of diploma courses from the different polytechnics?  And is there a similar standard for assessment and grading?  The current practice in some diploma courses to invite university academics to review the work of their final-year students is commendable and should be better structured to serve as an objective means of assessing the competence of students.    An additional GPA score, perhaps moderated at a national level and reflective of the student’s position in his course, can help universities more fairly process these applications.  Polytechnics should also publish the proportion of their diploma graduates who enter local universities, so that prospective students can make informed choices. Students who are certain that they want to pursue further education after their diplomas can thus better gauge which course will offer them the best chances.",9.970577500636146

LHL's [Facebook post](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/two-choices-for-general-election-timing-says-pm-lee-hsien-loong-12538522), for one, makes it very clear that he heavily favours elections sooner rather than later.   > “We have two choices. Either hope and pray that things will stabilise before the end of the term so that we can hold elections under more normal circumstances – but we have no certainty of that,” he wrote.   >   >“Or else call elections early, knowing that we are going into a hurricane, to elect a new government with a fresh mandate and a full term ahead of it, which can work with Singaporeans on the critical tasks at hand.”  So we can either vaguely hope for the best or do wow decisive new mandate! thing.

IMO, you don't just throw all that shit in the mainstream media if you don't want to at least see how the public reacts to the idea of an early election, or if you don't want them to start getting used to the idea.

2020,interview,">So, it's possible that the government is just ""complacent"". I think it's more likely that they know all of this, but nobody wants to hold a press conference explaining it.  I think there are actually many public statements indicating that the Government has an eye on these issues. Consider the rushed adjustments to the Budget; PM's second public address (as much of a 'non-announcement' it was); CCS's xia suay download to business owners; Vivian's CNBC interview; and the incoming new assistance package to be released soon.  The messaging has been, ""we're in this for the long haul, we must be mentally prepared. The G will do what it can to help smooth out rough spots, but businesses should take the chance to reposition and build in resiliency, and employees should retrain and improve relevance. The economy feeds back into our healthcare, so measures have to stand up to sustainability. ""  I'm not saying that the G is omniscient and have identified everything, or even that they have the right answers. Neither am I saying that we should meekly believe that everything will be alright by just voting for PAP.

That’s means you keep probing, seeking answers, checking with your supervisors for acceptance instead of focusing on the job at hand.
