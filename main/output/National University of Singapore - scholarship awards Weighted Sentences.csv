Cheeyarn, you may wish to take note of the above point^. This reason may prove to be true for some NTU courses.

I took amaths and economics during my secondary and poly time respectively. I also applied for nus fass for the previous 2 years, but they rejected me too which i dunno why.  Could it be the reason that i am serving ns now? I kinda at a loss about what to do. I dont really wanna go SIM with my gpa! No! In fact, NS should be an advantage especially if you get into command school! (That is also considered a non-accademic achievement) Other awards like best soldier may help too! NS is the best time to talk about your experiences and what made you decide (forgive me if I sound too drama or cliche) on going into that dream course! NTU/NUS/SMU requires students to write more about themselves for the courses they require to get into/why and there is a portion for non-accademic achievements. Remember to fill that up! Don't think it is not important because there are many people with the same GPA as you, so how do they consider applicants? To see if they have any additional talents/achievements they can bring with them outside their GPA!!! I cannot stress this enough, especially if you are from a poly! Also, I feel you about not being able to get into a local university of my choice! I screwed up my admission to get into my several dream courses at various Local U's during the first year because I thought they only look at GPA, and hence I didn't really bother much with the interview/and did not fill my non-CCA achievements. I thought I would definitely secure a place butI was so FRIGGIN WRONG. I felt like I was going to die literally because I couldn't get into a Local U. It was awful because I worked so friggin hard in poly D': Fortunately, I managed to pull myself together and manage to not screw up the second time and got into a local U with a course of my choice  So, DONT GIVE UP BRO. Now that you are closer to ORD, find some time to improve yourself, hunt down your poly lecturer to write you that testimonial letter for your university admission as they will really help. You are a merit holder, I am sure you have worked hard for it and paid attention during leessons. Your lecturers 会给你面子 if you are sincere and ask nicely!   If all else fails, there is always a local university route outside of NTU/NUS and it can be even better than the two.. but I can't say here.. later people will think I am biased towards certain university...

In NBS, i can assure you average is surely nearer to B+ than to B.   Also, personally, I will choose NBS over NUS business school.  Firstly, ranking wise, both school is on par with NBS having a longer history and hence better reputation.  Secondly, NUS average is around B while NBS average is around B+. (Both is by estimation) When working, people cares about what honors you get and having a better average helps. Thirdly, NBS cohort is way bigger than NUS cohort. It is known that it is easier to score better in a larger bell curve than a smaller one. Fourthly, NUS IGP is way higher than NBS. If the smaller bell curve isn't bad enough, the competition level in NUS is surely higher. At the end of the day, both schools provide the same degree so why go to the tougher one? Fifthly, NBS is 3 years as compared to NUS being 4 years (assuming you are aiming for honors)  Lastly, NUS do not allow students to go exchange after Y3S1 and all accounting mod need to be cleared in Singapore (making it way harder to go exchange) while NBS allow you to go any semester and most modules can be mapped overseas except for FRS related or law related modules (Eg: tax).

2015,scholarship|awards,"How Singapore's six public universities differ Published in ST on 3 March 2015http://www.straitstimes.com/singapor...rsities-differ With six public universities, students now have a diverse range of degrees to choose from. To attract the best students, the universities are striving to be different - in their programmes, tuition fees, student and faculty mix, accommodation options, financial help and overseas opportunities. Calvin Yang looks at the options offered. FULL-TIME DEGREE PROGRAMMES National University of Singapore (NUS): It has more than 50 full-time degrees, with exclusive ones such as those in dentistry, music and pharmacy. Nanyang Technological University (NTU): It has more than 50 degrees, with niche programmes such as communication studies, and sport science and management. Singapore Management University (SMU): It offers seven full-time programmes such as accountancy, law, information systems management and an SUTD-SMU dual degree programme in technology and management, launched last year. Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD): Its five degrees include architecture and sustainable design, engineering product development, engineering systems and design, and information systems technology and design. Singapore Institute of Technology (SIT): Catering mainly to polytechnic graduates, the university has 36 programmes - some offered by reputable partner universities and others run solely by SIT. The programmes include culinary arts management, criminology and security, game design and naval architecture. SIM University (UniSIM): The university synonymous with part-time degrees recently started offering full-time programmes in accountancy, finance and marketing. It will introduce a fourth full-time degree in human resource management this year. TUITION FEES These are for Singaporean students admitted in the academic year 2014/2015, except for UniSIM undergraduates. NUS: Annual tuition fees range between $7,850 - for courses like computing, engineering, and arts and social sciences - and $24,200 for medicine and dentistry. NTU: Fees are between $7,850 for most programmes, and $31,500 for medical students. SMU: Undergraduates who started last August are paying $11,100 per year, except for law students, who are paying $12,300. SUTD: An education at the university costs $11,650 per year. SIT: Annual fees range from $10,100 to $15,300. UniSIM: This year's accountancy students will pay about $33,000 for the entire degree programme, while students from other programmes will pay about $31,000. FINANCIAL HELP NUS: It has a wide range of scholarships and financial aid available. Over the past five years, it has seen a two-fold increase in students receiving scholarships, from about 800 in 2009 to 1,650 in 2013. There was a 60 per cent increase in the number of students receiving bursaries over the same period. NTU: For the new academic year that starts in August, it will be providing about 500 full-term scholarships, namely the Nanyang Scholarship and College Scholarship. Singaporean students interested in taking up a bursary each will receive assistance as long as their household per capita income is $1,900 or less per month. SMU: It has a comprehensive range of financial schemes. For scholarships, about 60 per cent of those who apply have been successful in securing a scholarship supported by the university or its donors. SUTD: It offers 173 scholarships and 43 bursaries, excluding government ones. SIT: More than 10 per cent of students are on scholarships or sponsorships by their employers or prospective employers. UniSIM: About a dozen scholarships, such as the SIM University Scholarship, and bursaries, such as the Ministry of Education Bursary, are available to students. STUDENT RESIDENCES NUS: The six halls of residence, four student residences and five residential colleges offer about 11,000 places in all for full-time students. A one-week stay in a typical single, non-air-conditioned room costs between $110 and $130. NTU: Its 18 residential halls house more than 10,400 undergraduates. Rental fees range from $225 to $280 monthly for a twin-sharing room. SMU: It does not have any student residences for local students. SUTD: It has three student housing blocks with a capacity of around 1,100 beds. Depending on the room type, an undergraduate typically pays around $350 to $480 per month. SIT: It does not offer any student residences. UniSIM: It does not have any student accommodation. OVERSEAS EXPOSURE NUS: About 70 per cent of undergraduates have at least an overseas exposure stint, such as summer school or internships. NTU: Some 80 per cent of students get some form of overseas exposure, such as taking classes at a partner university overseas. SMU: About 86 per cent of students have some form of overseas exposure, mainly through student exchange programmes. SUTD: Nearly 60 per cent of undergraduates have overseas experience. SIT: All students taking programmes offered by its partner universities abroad must go for an Overseas Immersion Programme as part of the curriculum. They spend between three and 17 weeks at the home campus of the university. Also, nearly all undergraduates doing SIT's own programmes have gone on study trips and work-study initiatives overseas. UniSIM: Its full-time students must go for an overseas stint during their studies. Currently, they have not started their stints, which may include a work attachment programme or a service learning project.",11.495584768859912

To deviate, the skills i find seriously lacking in some candidates today are multicultural literacy and global awareness, as well as the ability to work with people uniquely different from them.

TELL ME, WHICH FKING UNI IN THIS WORLD GIVES MONEY TO FOREIGNERS FOR STUDYING IN THEIR COUNTRY? the last i checked, the tuition grant comes from taxpayers. which happen to be mostly SINGAPOREANS. what right do the foreigner scum have to receive the grant? they should be paying EVERY SINGLE CENT themselves. gosh, cheapest recognised degree in the world for foreigners. Undergraduate intake for international students are more or less 20%. And they are moving towards reducing international students intake to 15% in the future, in concurrent with another movement to incrementally increase the local intake towards 40% of the cohort. If you are talking about the population of international students at any given time, then it is definitely more than 20%, due to the movement of students globally across universities. There are no dumping grounds in our universities, each faculties have their own industry and merits.

2016,scholarship|awards,"DISCLAIMER: I'd like to say that this post is not meant to flame anyone or put a negative spotlight on anyone. The examples I highlighted below are simply the comments/questions that I spotted which inspired me to write this. I wouldn't want to start a discussion about education in Singapore here, nor would this a debate for JC vs Poly. Just a little background about myself - I was a comms student in poly, did pretty average for my GPA (3.5x), missed the uni application in my first year of army, got rejected by NTU ADM last year, finally got a late acceptance letter from ADM this year. So trust me when I say I can empathise with those who are still waiting for their acceptance letter, and why some people are asking certain questions here.Spoiler!Hi guys, care to give your opinions and views on SMU Business VS NUS Statistics?  Which one will have higher demand by employers? The answer to this is simple, ask yourself where do you want to work? MNC? Local startup? The big 4? Starting your own business? Government sector? The 'value' of a degree is only given to by the people looking at it. Even then, there are those companies in each category that would defy the stereotypical hiring policy. So my advice to the poster who asked this question is to define who are your said 'employers' first. If you have no idea where you want to work or which sector of business you want to be in, it might serve you better to understand more about the course to see which specific programme/school/school culture might suit you better rather which degree appeals more to 'employers'. It's better to make an informed choice yourself.Spoiler!Actually, people do look at where you study. I got a couple of friends in HR. They told me that they would also look at the university, course, GPA/grades, modules taken, then any leadership roles regardless of how many years of relevant work experience a person has. Some say they tend to give more priority to old boys/girls, alum, that sort of thing. I'm not saying you're wrong here buddy, and in fact you're correct in saying this! But like I mentioned previously, it depends on where you're applying for work at, what is the company's hiring policy, what are they looking for etc. Comments like this might mislead some to think that this one degree/choice of school will make or break their future. What your friends experienced are the hiring policies of their particular companies they work at, but it's definitely not the same across various companies.There's no 'one size fits all' answer to certain questions. There is also no 'only one single path' to success. Some students don't realise it yet. This is the point that I'm driving at - Students should not be afraid to seek out multiple answers to a single question. There is always more than one way to solve a single question. Isn't that how it is for Math too? There may be one solution given in the answer book but it doesn't mean that that's the only one.If you do not get your university placing in the public schools this year, there are many other options! For poly students, you can take a gap year and work first, try again next year or the year after, like what I was planning to do myself should I not get my placing this year. Work experience ain't a bad idea too. For JC students, you can always take the A's again (like what some here are planning to do), to get a better grade for your dream course on the next application. I had a friend who couldn't get pharmaceutical, retook his A's while serving NS, scored a much better grade and went on to pharmaceutical on a scholarship in the end. If you really want to study this year, then private schools might be a viable idea as well. Yes things might not have gone according to plan for you. You might have been taught your whole life that you must get into NTU/NUS/SMU, or that might have been pressure on yourself. But fact is, if you're not getting in (even after appeal), then it's on you to take your next step forward. You have to keep moving forward in life despite the obstacles you face. If you're really rejected in the end, allow yourself to be sad for a little while, then pick yourself up, make plans, take the next step forward and move on. You might have to take a little detour, but it doesn't mean you can't get there. It's just how badly you want it. I hope this lengthy post written at 3am in the morning would encourage some of you even a little, because I know what it's like to constantly fail at every turn and have life keep pushing you down. If it did, then I'm glad. ",13.838287155833926

Describe yourself. 2. Why do you think we should accept you? How can you contribute to NTU? 3. Did you apply in other Universities as well?Probing Questions 1. Describe yourself in 2 sentences. [Stress Test -1] 2. Describe yourself in only 3 words. [Stress Test -1] 3. Which community areas did you serve? [Probing CCAs & Interests -2] 4. Why didn't you apply for Humanities & Social Studies instead? [Probing CCAs & Interests -2] 5. Why do you still want to choose NTU instead of NUS? [Universities Choice -3] Below are just my opinions. The interview ended surprisingly faster than expected - far less than 10 minutes. However, there were no questions related to assess my competency for ACBS, and I guess that these questions are completely the same as single degree interview. Also, I doubt they even know what I actually applied for. So for those who are applying ACBS as well, do rest assure.  Comparing NTU and SMU, I find that NTU is more rigid in the way they conduct their interviews. They seem to have a list of standardized questions to be asked. Whereas for SMU, after I spoken about my attachment in one of the Big 4, the whole conversation was all about the work I did, and how I was able to cope with stress in the environment. Very friendly professors. As such, it is much easier to control your conversation topic for SMU. Again, in my opinion, NTU is more interested in how you can contribute to NTU. Whilst for SMU, the professors really want to know you as an individual. Also, the interviewers in NTU seem to be expressionless; it feels that I was talking to robots, but at the very least they did hold eye contact with me. Both are equally efficient in conducting their interviews nevertheless. Generally agree with Aomatsu.  Just to add on, I went for the ACBS interview back in 2014, because, you know, NS, and the main interviewer was Prof Valerie. We had a rather entertaining conversation and it was more of a chit-chat session than an interview. NTU knows what courses you applied for. She had my application form in hard copy on the table (in full view) and asked me why I applied for REP as my 2nd choice, and only put Accountancy (single degree) as the 3rd choice. Other than that, the main focus was definitely on how I would contribute NTU if they offered me a place/scholarship. Of course I talked about joining some clubs in NBS, my career goals and the various competitions/events at NTU which interest me. They didn't ask me those ""essay"" kind of questions though, but we chatted for around 20 minutes. It was a very light-hearted and enjoyable session and it felt really short in fact. After the interview, the prof invited me to apply for the USP. I also went for the SMU interview (also in 2014) for the double degree programme in Accountancy and Business. I remember being interviewed by Prof Seow and Prof Gary Pan. They seemed really concerned about whether I applied to NUS/NTU and asked me which I would pick if I was offered all 3. It somehow gave me the impression that they were being insecure/desperate. However, I liked the fact that they gave more attention to my hobbies and interests and focused less on academic achievements. I guess this is one example of SMU's holistic admissions process. They were also constantly marketing their school throughout the interview by asking me if I knew that their school of accountancy was ranked xxx in the BYU rankings etc, and kept comparing them to the other 2 unis. What I got out of that interview was that the profs at SMU are really passionate about what they do and that they're incredibly driven especially when it comes to building the school's reputation.  At the end of the day, both are local universities. Employers will lump NUS/NTU/SMU together anyway. So in terms of employability, no difference really. Choose the school which suits your personality better.",12.684889952580482
2016,scholarship|awards,"Mistwald04 wrote:  I understand what you mean, just that your post got me thinking. For the applicants using UAS for admission, maybe the people behind the scene needs to consider both the UAS and the ranking of choices. (E.g. If B who obtain UAS of 75 put Course X as first choice and C who obtain UAS of 80 put Course X as second choice, who should be admitted?) This is just a simple scenario but imagine there are many more cases like this. The admission office is not the one who make the final decision and each application needs to circulate through the different faculties? For those non quantifiable components, computer will not be able to do the job and the profs need to go through one by one to see who deserve an interview. But the most important point is that in this working society, people procrastinate. No one will be sitting there 8 hrs a day to deal with applications only. Most likely have some coffee breaks in between or chit chat or do other stuff while dealing with the mountains of applications.ChocolateCat wrote:  The non-quantifiable components like CCA, awards, other achievements are only for those who apply through/with non-academic achievements which has a separate 10% quota. The overwhelming majority of applicants is just based on their university admission score - Rank points for JC students, 80% GPA + 20% O's for poly students. This part should be simple sorting. Doesn't matter got 1000 or 10000 applicants.. computer can easily organize it almost instantly what. but yes, my point was it's not as simple as we think. just curious what is going on behind the scenes that is responsible for the delay. In case you missed my other post:  Feel free to correct me if anyone else has more info about this.  I've gotten a variety of answers from all different unis, some giving the politically correct answer of ""equal chances"", however it is indeed true that it is pretty much computerized when they tabulate your scores and your choices. From what I heard from the stuff, if your scores are too far from the cut-off, your application will not be reviewed by the respective faculties. Instead it will end off at the admission committee The admission committee consists of profs from the respective faculties, coming together to evaluate individuals who have applied for NAA or are of borderline. An interview is then held at the faculty for students they are interested in, where they'll write comments for the students, followed by a scoring rubric. This sheet is then passed back to the admission committee to make the FINAL call to give you an offer or not. (At least for NAA I know this is the procedure la). The faculty can only SUGGEST that you're a promising candidate. If you think about it, its the sad truth cause no way are they able to evaluate thousands of applicants manually and in detail, thus they always ask you to list your most important/outstanding qualities first. Appeals are normally quite hard, and is generally for students that have just gotten a new achievement, work experience, sat etc. Hope this helps",12.543888093636872

I'm sure the previous posters do not need you to apologize on their behalf. I really do not understand why I need to be thankful that im born a Singaporean. What I should be thankfulis the selfless contributions of all our forefathers, who came over to a undelveloped land at an uncertain times, and they did not leave, instead they stayed to make this place better. I I am thankful to my parents for working hard and paying the taxes that led to the development of this country. I am thankful to all the Singaporean sons (myself included) that serves and brings about stability in the country which in turn bring about growth and development .  Now tell me, at which part did these foreign students that feels they should have a place over SG students fit in? At which part did their parents and forefathers fit in? It is a fact that scores of them are here on our scholarships and taking the limited places in our uni, it is a done deal and we LLST, the last thing they should do is to whine when some policies seems to favour locals over them. America once preached about its ethos of diversity and freedom, yet look at the state of the country. Racism is rampant and individualism trumps mutual understanding. I do not think this is the Singapore our forefathers want for us as well. Yes, many of us Singaporean have to thank our parents for the contribution they have made. But your comment seems to exclude naturalized citizens, who moved here 1 generation ago. Their children enjoy the privileges of being a Singapore, and does the fact that their parents aren't Singapore-born (and hence contributed little to the country) mean that they are any ""less Singaporean""? You are in the position to say all this because you have been blind to the number of privileges you have enjoyed throughout your life. How do you feel receiving the same comment should you try out for renown schools like Cambridge or Oxford? The reason you should be thankful of being born a Singaporean is for the same reason. If everyone had a choice, they would all want to be born into a rich family in a country with high standards of living. Your birth is only due to natural selection... In any case, quotas for international students and PRs are already fixed. Want to know the reason behind our high local university rankings? Do a little more research... The size of international faculty and students account for 10% of the criteria used in the QS World University Ranking.

He just has higher expectations than the general populace when it comes to retaking A levels. Yes,he might not have gotten crappy results,but I can offer an alternative side of the story since I known him during my JC days. During my JC days,I didn't know louie till J2,when my friend invited him over to join us for a game of badminton on a Saturday in our JC. Back then, I only knew louie as being one of the best in maths/chem in my JC and he did well for that in his first A levels,so I was amazed that he was considering of retaking A's  with his results during NS(1yr my senior). He later,told me that he wasn't satisfied with his A levels results,as he hopes to get into pharmacy in NUS.  I lost contact with him,till I finished NS and I was surprised to learn that he took a gap yr after his NS,to volunteer in hospitals and also retake the A levels. I guess at this point of time,girls should be able to empathise with him at the very least,since he went through an extra yr after NS to re-do his A's. In fact,he told me his plans to re-take As this yr,but I advised him not to and to apply for university instead,since it's counter-intuitive to not go into uni,given his financial circumstances.(He can't consider overseas) Though he didn't get to pharmacy(I guess it's pharmacy's loss to not accept him), he got into nanyang scholarship programme,after all the efforts invested. I feel it's a valiant effort,coming from someone who didn't have any tuition,academic guidance during his period of retakes and still managed to make unconventional decisions(that might not seem logical to the majority) that guaranteed his success. Don't judge the book by it's cover,is all I have to say,to anyone who doubts that he doesn't experience emotional pain after each admission cycle. Emotional pain after each admission cycle? This is weird, anyone who did worse than him is suffering worse than him during the admission cycle. He did well to qualify for 95% of the courses in local university, but he is just being bent on getting into Pharmacy.  What Eddie previously meant that Louie was not the most suited person to share his experience about a success story from past failures. An example of a ''real success story'' would be middleofnowhere. He has already been performing extremely well in school, as well in A Levels. But in terms of providing advice to students who are retaking A levels (because they have failed), he will not be able to provide helpful advice. It is not a loss that Pharmacy did not accept him, but he did not fulfil the requirements set by the administration. You mentioned it as a courageous effort of him to retake A levels countless of time despite his financial difficulties, no tuition, etc. But, bear in mind, is he can choose not to retake A levels 4 times and enter Uni straight after NS, but he chose not to. He chose merely because he is obsessed into getting the course he wished to enter. Frankly speaking, from your entire paragraph, what are you trying to conclude? You kept harping on the fact that he retook A levels as if he has no choice, difficult economic situations, people must empathise him, he is really bold in making such decisions, etc.. But, you must not be biased in your opinions just because he is your classmate. I mean, also do clarify what emotional pain that he has to undergo? Being not able to enter Pharmacy, despite having tons of other choices waiting for him to choose from? There are many people out there with so little options to choose from, their emotional pain is far much worse than what he is facing.. Nevertheless, it is great that he finally resigned to his fate and know that he has a slim chance into entering Pharmacy. He should have done that 2 years back, and not clinging on to the hope that he can enter Pharmacy one day.

I'm actually currently an ITE (going to be graduating soon) student that's looking on to which polytechnics I should advance on and then subsequently, I intend on going to Uni to do a degree. While I think the PBL-pedagogy is great I would prefer something old school perhaps like at SP, NYP or maybe even NP. I would be okay with joining any of their generalised Business Diplomas, but because my lecturers here at ITE have been telling me to go to RP supposedly (""for increased chances to get top student and go to Uni"") hence that was where I was going with my original question on RP students who are mainly from R48, R52- what were their odds on advancing to University. Ultimately, I do not want to jeopardise my chances of getting to Uni if I go to RP, because I think even tho there are some benefits about PBL- the Big3 Unis still have some doubts & stigma about the learning style there at RP. At least that's what I heard when I talked to my lecturers.  Idk about you but I feel RP's Business or ""Management"" courses feels really lackluster in terms of what they cover unlike other Polys which offer dual specialisation options. Some of these which one can maybe even use in Uni? I would love to hear your thoughts. Thanks for the reply! I am from that prestigious poly with a motto in Malay ""Berkhidmat dengan Keahlian"". Lots of hype, smoke and mirror ... despite my academic excellence there. Still, I really believe that I am disadvantaged in life without PBL.  With regards to your concern, just concentrate on getting into a poly from ITE and let time dictate the outcome towards university. After all, it really ""is the singer not the song"". Meaning that if you excel in whatever you put your heart and mind to, the place you did it doesn't matter. Nothing can block your progress. You will then be positioned to do what you want to do. Not what you need to do. Like so many poor souls in this forum.  Be in the position where all university invites you to apply for priority (aka early) admission and lay out the 'red carpets' of talks, open house, individualised chats with professors, private group tours of labs, scholarship offers, etc. Be flagged by their admission scouts. Be sought after to add shine to their institutions. Win win. Got it?  Above all, be good to your parents. May you be well and happy. Amituofo",12.358906062705556

Yes,he might not have gotten crappy results,but I can offer an alternative side of the story since I known him during my JC days. During my JC days,I didn't know louie till J2,when my friend invited him over to join us for a game of badminton on a Saturday in our JC. Back then, I only knew louie as being one of the best in maths/chem in my JC and he did well for that in his first A levels,so I was amazed that he was considering of retaking A's  with his results during NS(1yr my senior). He later,told me that he wasn't satisfied with his A levels results,as he hopes to get into pharmacy in NUS.  I lost contact with him,till I finished NS and I was surprised to learn that he took a gap yr after his NS,to volunteer in hospitals and also retake the A levels. I guess at this point of time,girls should be able to empathise with him at the very least,since he went through an extra yr after NS to re-do his A's. In fact,he told me his plans to re-take As this yr,but I advised him not to and to apply for university instead,since it's counter-intuitive to not go into uni,given his financial circumstances.(He can't consider overseas) Though he didn't get to pharmacy(I guess it's pharmacy's loss to not accept him), he got into nanyang scholarship programme,after all the efforts invested. I feel it's a valiant effort,coming from someone who didn't have any tuition,academic guidance during his period of retakes and still managed to make unconventional decisions(that might not seem logical to the majority) that guaranteed his success.

Not to forget there is grade moderation / bell curve too.  There are multiple reason why MS employment rates are high for every year.  First, out of all 3 local uni, only NTU offer a full 4 years Maritime course. Not much direct competition from NUS or SMU (I think SMU there is a Maritime econs concentration in one of their course).  International Maritime companies will naturally source for NTU MS graduates every year.  Secondly, the course have multiple internship opportunities available for student since year 1 (MS is a small family). Some companies are willing to offer you a position prior to graduation.  For the question on declining Maritime Industry : yes, the container industry is not doing well now. However, many companies are offering management trainee programme to groom prospective talents for the booming period. The declining period of an economy cycle are usually the best time to train talents. If you are a girl, you will probably graduate in 4 years time and I believe the economy may recover by then. Guy wise, 2 years of NS + 4 years to graduate, quite safe to say you are the luckier ones  Just my 2 cents worth of opinion  Oh ya for those who are interested in MS, there will be a guaranteed exchange programme to Norway BI in year 3 sem 1  Cheers ",10.275338366289702

Im assuming this post is referring to biz/act That isn't accurate.

Some plus points for NUS Business/Act are: - You can opt to graduate in 3 years instead of 4. It isnt compulsory to do the final year. - You can take up a second specialisation of business using your unrestricted mods ie. Accountancy students can specialise in Finance while business students can have dual specialisation in 2 fields of business (finance+marketing etc) - There are 3 new specialisations namely Economics, Business analytics and entrepreneurship , making it to a total of 7 - There is no requirement to select a field of specialisation eg. You dont have to compete your gpa to study more popular modules like finance. Its all about bidding.  - Compulsory overseas experience for all students (OYEAHHHH) Of course, NTU do have its own strong points too The extra year saves you studying costs and gives you an advantageous head start in the corporate world.

Is that overdress or what's to be expected? (I don't get why the email even said smart casual, but I just followed the email...) NTU and NUS completely ignoring me forever. I've gotten so depressed I'm no longer depressed. Perhaps this is one way of curing yourself of depression: where everything becomes a delusion and nothing in life matters anymore. It sucks that everything to form a judgment on someone can just be based on a single event on a single day and nothing else, but well, that's life. You can say there's still time but I just can't take waiting up to 3 agonizing more months later. If anything, the only realistic thing in life that will ever happen is me writing that appeal letter. Before your comments get lost in the sea of comments on this very active forum, let me reply to your rant/concerns. I just want to say that I get you. I totally do. Why? I was once in your position last year. Unknowingly fell into depression during the waiting period from April to May because I waited hopelessly for things that eventually (and obviously) did not come true... Exactly 1 year ago on this date (13 April 2017), I received a devastating offer from NTU — environmental engineering, and that was my last choice. It was supposed to be a celebration, that I received an offer, but it was the absolute last thing I wanted, since it wasn't my first choice, and something that I knew I couldn't accept doing (and was stupid enough to even place it in my choices, ah well).  Subsequently I got rejected by NUS and SMU, because I simply didn't make the cut... With a heavy heart I signed up (late) for private A levels, and as much as I hated the idea of having to retake, having to suffer... I had no choice. I really wanted to prove to myself that I CAN get into local uni. It didn't help when I'm from one of the top JCs, and my friends are moving on happily to overseas unis with unconditional offers, scholarships, or medicine, law, dentistry... you name it. I was utterly alone. And I felt like I was the only loser in my school (and also a disgrace to my school) who had to retake A levels, who couldn't really make the cut for local uni. In the end, ALL my appeals failed. What's new? Reality slapped me hard in the face, and it hurt like a bitch, of course. What could I do? I had to move on. I then spent some time correcting my mindset before I was actually more mentally stable for my exams. But I just have to tell you that you are really doing yourself a huge disfavour right now. Yes you are disappointed, you are not receiving news, everything seems oh so damn hopeless. But self pity will only kill you, as well as the people around you who love and care for you... do know that YOU are not the only one suffering, your family and friends are too! Everything seems bleak right now yes, but once you get that offer, everything will be merry and bright...  For me, I knew that I wanted to go to uni. I spent that one more year not just preparing for retake, but also redefining my goals and aspirations in my life. Also, building on my character. Depression no more! There were many sacrifices made, many times that I felt like hiding in a cave... but I overcame that and grew so much stronger. As long as you YEARN it, you will get it no matter what, because no one can stop you!! So don't even let the demons in your head stop you, please do not give in to depression.

Coming from a disadvantaged background, I spent most of my time working to facilitate personal living expenses as well as to contribute to the family's finances. And with most of the time spent on work (e.g. after-school hours, weekends, and vacation periods), my investment in non-academic activities (e.g. CCA, competitions, etc.) was limited to 8 hours per week and would often have to give up on activities such as YEP and OIP due to the cost and time involved. Therefore, my non-academic profile was considered to be ""insubstantial"" in comparison with other individuals who had the resources to be a full-time student. Whilst there is nothing wrong with awarding scholarships primarily on academic achievement, the current selection criteria and system may be further skewed against lower-income households, as their children may have less in the areas of co-curricular activities, leadership track record, etc, because of their limited financial resources. This may further stack the odds against the lower-income, who have fewer resources to access tuition, enrichment programmes, learning aids, etc. The irony of how institutions used a uniform assessment method to evaluate people of diverse backgrounds - the subtle ways colleges discriminate against poor students  Ultimately, life is fair because the world is unfair to everyone  Heng (lucky) still can apply for financial aid  Woah!

The primary objective of my earlier post aims to encourage individuals who are currently applying/appealing for admission and/or scholarship - through the sharing of my education journey and the challenges experienced as an individual with a disadvantaged background. Subsequently, the post also seeks to highlight the flaws in the basis of selection for the scholarship interview. Today, institutions are still using a uniform assessment method to evaluate people of diverse backgrounds. The assessment for academic potential is pretty straightforward - cGPA, awards, and other academic achievement obtained from other sources (e.g. competitions, courses, etc.). The tricky part lies in the assessment of non-academic components - institutions seek individuals with certain attributes, qualities, and skills (e.g. leadership, teamwork, entrepreneurship, integrity, sports achievement, etc.). And often, institutions only consider school-related activities and/or co-curricular activities as the samples for their assessment.  On a personal note, I believed that those attributes, qualities, and skillscould also beidentified and assessed through employment experience (e.g. customers' testimonials, appraisals by superiors, awards attained, etc.).  In general, institutions should also look beyond the school-related activities and co-curricular activities when assessing the non-academic components of individuals. Hence, granting more flexibility for underprivileged students whose non-academic profile were considered as ""insubstantial"" and thereby allowing  them to have the opportunity to share their stories. Ultimately, an interview is all we need.P.s. I'm glad that your hard work paid off, and congrats on securing that scholarship offered by a private company  (I missed the application deadline for private & government scholarship ) To be shortlisted for interview on the government scholarship with 3.5GPA, you must have some really outstanding non-academic achievements!

With the 1.25 points, the student who lists the course as his first choice will get ahead of the person with 82 points,"" he said. On why NUS decided on the move, he said: ""If you have done well and are passionate about a career in business or computing, for example, then we want to say to you that we support your passion."" ""We want to help you pursue your passion,"" he said, adding that students passionate about what they study tend to perform better. Professor Ho revealed that, currently, 65 per cent of students given a place in their first-choice course take up the offer, while only 45 per cent of those given their second-choice course do so. Noting NUS graduates' good job prospects, Prof Ho also announced that NUS will be increasing the number of double majors to increase career options for its graduates. ""The nature of work is changing very rapidly, and we need to prepare students for a lifetime of diverse careers,"" he said. He said NUS, which currently offers 94 double major and major-minor combinations, will add another 86 such programmes. ""Someone doing data science and entrepreneurship, for example, can go and work for a range of industries in data science, and also go and do a start-up."" On top of the double majors, NUS also offers 71 double degrees, 33 joint degrees with partner universities and 24 concurrent degrees. Adding all this, currently 15 per cent of NUS students are trained in more than one discipline. Prof Ho said he hopes half of all NUS students will graduate with knowledge and skills in two different fields, so they will have more job offers to choose from. He also announced two new degree programmes for this year, one in pharmaceutical science and the other in veterinary science. Students taking up the 5 1/2-year concurrent veterinary degree programme will graduate with an NUS degree in life sciences and a Doctor of Veterinary Medicine from the University of Melbourne. NUS, which now offers 230 bond-free merit scholarships, will add 200 more scholarships for the new academic year. Ms Geraldine Tan, 19, welcomed the move by NUS and said it is important for young people to get into a field that excites them.

Private company offer me a scholarship instead. Was juggling full time work and full tome study in a local u. It’s a miracle I even sustain 3.5 out of 4. Just that my work is rather niche. And not those waiter etc which provide no actual value to education other than financially.  And cca is useless. Hello there! Totally agree with you that scholarship should not be awarded based on academic performance only, which I did mention in my earlier post. The primary objective of my earlier post aims to encourage individuals who are currently applying/appealing for admission and/or scholarship - through the sharing of my education journey and the challenges experienced as an individual with a disadvantaged background. Subsequently, the post also seeks to highlight the flaws in the basis of selection for the scholarship interview. Today, institutions are still using a uniform assessment method to evaluate people of diverse backgrounds. The assessment for academic potential is pretty straightforward - cGPA, awards, and other academic achievement obtained from other sources (e.g. competitions, courses, etc.). The tricky part lies in the assessment of non-academic components - institutions seek individuals with certain attributes, qualities, and skills (e.g. leadership, teamwork, entrepreneurship, integrity, sports achievement, etc.). And often, institutions only consider school-related activities and/or co-curricular activities as the samples for their assessment.  On a personal note, I believed that those attributes, qualities, and skillscould also beidentified and assessed through employment experience (e.g. customers' testimonials, appraisals by superiors, awards attained, etc.).  In general, institutions should also look beyond the school-related activities and co-curricular activities when assessing the non-academic components of individuals. Hence, granting more flexibility for underprivileged students whose non-academic profile were considered as ""insubstantial"" and thereby allowing  them to have the opportunity to share their stories. Ultimately, an interview is all we need.P.s. I'm glad that your hard work paid off, and congrats on securing that scholarship offered by a private company  (I missed the application deadline for private & government scholarship ) To be shortlisted for interview on the government scholarship with 3.5GPA, you must have some really outstanding non-academic achievements! Do you mind to share with us? And hello senior , assuming you are an SMU student (based on the GPA capped at 4.0). As an individual with similar experience, juggling between full-time work and study is really no joke, not to mention that you are doing it at the University-level and still managed to scored a decent grade. Mind to share what full-time job you work as? Do you study in the day, and work at night/after-school hours? Did you, perhaps, packed all modules into that few days so that you could work for the rest of the days in the week? Sincerely hope that you can share some tips with us/me ",11.984522629820846

I'm pretty sure there's only anecdotal evidence available, but that's better than nothing.  I'm a science student that'd love to major in computer science. As of the fifth semester, I have a cGPA of 3.942 and my L1R4 is 6. While I don't have Amath, I do take advanced math modules, which I have been told will more than waive the requirement. Considering that I didn’t get accepted during the early admission exercise and the sustained radio silence from both universities, I’m starting to wonder if I’ll be shuffled back into science after all. Sigh! As a poly grad now in NTU, I only got one answer for all of you poly grads: If your GPA is far from their cut-off, do not pin any hopes on the universities. But if your GPA is nicely within their 10th percentile, then yes you definitely stand a good chance but then again, anything can happen. 3.94 seems okay, you just gotta wait and I hope you wrote well for your personal statement. They don't care what you studied in poly, its the GPA that they look at, and look at only.  So if you have GPA 3.3 and aiming for WKW, I would dare say your chances are very very very slim, even with your Dip w Merit, because there are people from other comms courses who may have a way higher GPA (that may meet the 10th percentile), yet did not get Dip w Merit. If you are trying by DA, which I highly recommend to anyone from poly, you really need to show that you have done comms-related stuff before, best if you have won some awards. CCA records are really nothing in their eyes, because every other JC kid also have good CCA records because it is simply part of their school life. To qualify under DA, you need to have something more than everyone else don't. Even then, there is no guarantee they will call you up for interview.

Personally, I like both SMU and NUS but school fees is really a factor that I must take into account of. Moreover, I do not have an extensive knowledge on how SMU IS curriculum. I wonder is it the same as NUS? or does it differ a lot?  So if NUS rejects me this year, I intend to reject SMU offer, and apply next year to NUS. The reason being university will no longer take into account of O Level result from Y2020 onwards. I was a PFP student and does not have an O Level result thus the long wait or possible rejection from NUS.

They'll then decide if I'm worthy of a Distinction for the project module.

2019,scholarship|awards,"Maybe they do. We don't exactly know what the universities take into account or not. However, your GPA is good enough so you don't have to stress out about the distinctions. If you are invited for an interview, you can talk about the distinction event you attended to defend your project as that might be impressive to interviewers. As the other commenter said, concentrate on scholarship application as you are already 95-99% admitted to the university.Metanoid wrote:  I'm in NYP and they don't offer prizes for distinctions at all. So to answer your question, no, I didn't. However, for project modules, if my project is deemed good enough for a distinction, I'll have to attend a ""Outstanding Project Presentation"" which is also known as ""Distinction Presentation"" and present to a panel of judges which consists of the Course Manager, Course Coordinator, Moderator and tutors from all classes. They'll then decide if I'm worthy of a Distinction for the project module.  I was wondering why do people of high authority (Course Manager and etc) bother to arrange and attend the ""Distinction Presentation"" amidst their busy schedule if Distinctions don't matter to uni at all... or why would all polys even bother issue distinctions in the first place if they don't help at all. Food for thought... I'm sorry. I am just really puzzled. Thanks a lot for replying. ",7.815281922694647
2020,scholarship|awards,"I’m the only daughter in my family, and the youngest. My parents are pretty toxic, good at gaslighting, and pretty controlling too.   -school- Ever since I was young I wasn’t allowed to stay over at people’s houses because my parents were scared that something would happen to me. They didn’t want to let me study overseas despite my dream to, and after they didn’t allow me to take the SAT gaslighted me by talking about how much I could’ve earned working there (tsk).   Then there was the constant comparisons to other children - how they were doing better in their DIFFERENT SCHOOLS with DIFFERENT PAPERS, how they got scholarships and all these opportunities with ministers and idk what. I mean, idk about my parents but most of those kids either ended up not doing as well as me (which they never mentioned), or are dead because they committed suicide.   I think one of the worst things was that whenever I fell out with my friends by no fault of my own / got bullied and ostracised super badly (still have that trauma until now which led to anxiety, depression, low self esteem and major trust issues) they would blame me for being unlikeable or having a “personality problem”. It’s really not a great feeling when you feel like you have nobody and your bloody parents can’t even be sensitive and be there for you. My mum would always say I was temperamental and should be “gentle” and more ladylike - just to clarify I don’t really think I’m over reactive I’m just outspoken about wanting to be treated right - which I’ve come to realise, does not connote to being difficult. It just means I know where I stand and I stay there. I confided this in them once and not only did my mum play the victim, my dad makes jokes about how I shouldn’t “do something regrettable” because they raised me up so well. They also don’t believe I can have mental problems because they “raised me well”.  - as a woman -  Even earlier today they shamed me for wearing what they considered a “revealing” top and my mum said that my way of dressing would prevent me from finding good honest boys and encourage harassment - she’s from the school of victim blaming where the short skirt attracts wrongdoing but it would still be the girl’s fault. They always wanted me to dress more “elegantly” etc. I mean, I’m not going to wear a turtleneck and long pants in 40 degree weather, thank you.   Going out clubbing freaks them out so much - they will literally blast my phone so many times in the night to see whether I’m alive / not raped / kidnapped somewhere / dead and basically tell me they’re losing sleep cos I’m not home. I’m a very responsible person - never been home drunk (don’t like the feeling), never stayed over without telling them it was with a friend I trusted, never went out with people I don’t trust, really nothing to raise suspicions at all. They’re suspicious of Grab drivers so they always want to pick me up - if I say yes, they will blast my phone every 10 minutes to see if I was ready to go home even if I had told them what time I’d be done.   I wasn’t allowed to pierce my ears until I forced them to when I was 18.   They were mad I blocked them from my instagram. But my mum would check my likes and ask me about people who didn’t like my post and whether it was cos my “disagreeable” ass fell out with them. She would look at my posts and criticise my appearance etc. There was a big argument once I blocked her. She called me an ungrateful child and told me she was “very hurt” by my selfish actions. I want to live my life?   - love life -   My parents are traditional people who think I should find a deferential rich boy. Because everybody walks around with their net worth printed on their foreheads right?   I tried to be that for them, but came to realise you can’t help who you’re attracted to. I guess unfortunately for them I was attracted to my boyfriend who is from a single parent family, not of “good financial standing”, and in their opinion “ugly”. After one month of being together I told them about him, and for that month at any point in time they made sure to mention how poor, ugly and “mentally scarred” he was from his parent’s divorce. It put a lot of stress on us and we took a break for a while. We’re back together now, but I haven’t told them. None of us deserve to be subject to judgment for things we can’t control. I don’t plan to tell them anything until I am independent.  I think I learnt this too from how they ruined my brother’s relationship - they’d let his gf come to dinner and proceed to constantly trash her behind her back in front of my brother or the rest of us even. It was pretty two faced and weird. Of course, no sex before marriage. Whatever.   - where I’m at now -  I’ve been safely staying away from them by staying in my uni hostel. They are very unhappy about this, but my insistence won. My uni hostel isn’t far from home, which made them feel it was a waste of money.   I think coming to uni and being out from their influence more made me realise I was being gaslighted and emotionally abused (even if they don’t recognise it). I’ve come to draw a lot more boundaries regarding my life and learnt to stand my ground. Not to say the comments don’t sting, and I’ve still got a few more years of big stings and tears to go no doubt, but I’ve got a really good network that understands my struggle. My boyfriend has been with my the whole way through my journey and has been really understanding and also opened me up to what was happening to me.   I’ve come to really address my anxiety and depression, and although I do get the occasional panic attacks and am no perfect person by any means, I think I’ve come to accept myself a lot more than I used to. More importantly, I am a happier person. A lot of stress keeping things from them, but nevertheless so much happier.   I can’t wait to work my ass off and move out permanently.",16.698068021125046
2020,scholarship|awards,"Some basic requirements are [listed in their website](https://www.scdf.gov.sg/home/join-us/uniformed-positions) in case you need to have a bookmark.  To answer your questions:  1. You will need to remove it as a measure of confidence. Most paramedics wear [short sleeved vests](https://nyp.jobscentral.com.sg/magazine/polytechnic-2017/img/scdf-masthead.jpg) so your tattoo will be visible.  2. Shift cycles go by this: 2 13-hour daytime shifts, 1 day of ""reserved duty"" (administrative work), 1 day off, 2 11-hour night shifts, another day of ""reserved duty"", and 1 day off. By mandate, any work that requires a total of 24 hours of employed work needs to be offset by 48 hours of rest, but because paramedics in SCDF work in staggered 24-hour shifts, there's some flexibility involved.  3. Could you elaborate on what specifics you want to pursue? Urban search and rescue? Mass casualty response? Emergency psychology? These fields are available once you have informed your officer-in-charge of your desired expertise. Usually after you have stabilised for a period of tiem, you can approach your officer-in-charge to plan your career.  4. This will be long, and my memory was taken from my discussions with fellow paramedics that I talked to in my time as a medic, so your mileage may vary.  To start, you will be attached to SAF Medical School seconded under the SCDF organization to train you up on emergency field paramedicine. The total time will be three years, with each year you're being tested on practical and theory work. You will be attached at least six months to a fire station (not sure if by choice or by allocation of manpower resources) to pick up the training on handling real-life patients. You will be mostly performing more advanced duties like needle injection and infusion (IV), airway tubing, vacuum suctioning, ECG and pre-hospital ACLS routines, advanced spine management, extreme traumatic injuries, inter- and post-natal emergencies, and first aid that an NSF medic isn't expected to handle. You will also be learning on field management (e.g. radio reporting, situational awareness etc.) to complement your paramedicine duties. Afterwards, you will be tested, and you need to pass 80% of your assessments to advance to the next level of paramedicine. Only after the completion of 3 years of training will you be officially a paramedic.  Afterwards, you are attached to a fire station, still, not sure if by choice or by current allocation. You have two overall in charge: the commanding officer for the fire station, and the paramedic officer-in-charge of EMS. You will follow the regulations as set by the fire station CO, (as an overall leader in charge of the fire station representing SCDF at large), and you will follow the occupation regulations as set forth by the OIC (operational procedures, case paperwork, medical logistics etc.). Depending on your level of experience, you can be seconded as an assistant to the OIC, or you can be posted as a fast-response paramedic (usually it's performed by paramedics converted from fire and rescue units).  Most firefighters are OK with paramedics, but because the operational framework is different (one deals with fires and rescue operations, the other, fixing the human body so that it survives the hsopital trip) the only other time you get together is in drills and exercises, as well as station bonding activities and various inter-department and inter-division activities. If firefighters are physically shiong, you, as a paramedic, it's a mental shiong.  Rewards may/may not include: letter of commendation by members of the public, appearing in newspapers, service awards. Not so nice things include: public complaints, which may affect your performance bonus.  Last but not least, at the very least, you are serving for a noble cause. May you live long and prosper, and may the odds be ever in your favour. Good luck.",13.663345024448994
2020,scholarship|awards,"Writer is clearly justifying the case to bail out the national carrier, but really, your former PM Lee Kuan Yew mentioned that Singapore is different, in that the system will not bailout private companies and let them fail if need to be. Of course, me citing his words doesn't mean one has to follow traditions and past ideas blindly. One has to adaptive. Then again, providing a bailout just because of national pride is senseless because when it comes to business, decisions must be firmly rooted in logic and business sense. So what it has won a lot of awards? Also, given the current unpredictability of the business landscape, this company can become an absolute blackhole, sucking endless resources until it finally dies. A national carrier is like a person's car. If the economic situation is bad, lets say an individual is struggling to keep up with mortgages and other fixed payments and unable to maintain steady cash flow, would you quickly dispose the car or change to a smaller car or take public transport? One day when situation is better, maybe i can get myself the same car or better one? Or you would maintain the same car and try to refinance to lower interest rate? It all depends on your current savings and cashflow, plus future business outlook. Anyway, there's so many other corporate options other than bailing out by infusing tax payers' money. Ask the bankers and financiers to refinance, increase existing loan tenures, take on more debts, spin offs, restructure, etc. If really the national pride of Singapore, why not consider a SIA National Pride Bond and raise one round of cash from Singaporeans?   But that's a very simplistic way of thinking but essentially an important one. If Singaporeans refused to bail the national carrier, there are certainly cascading effects at many levels for example, maintenance industry, spare parts suppliers, pull-outs of foreign air industry related companies and so on. Many more and hopefully you are able to mind-map all possibilities. Finally, whether or not SIA deserves a helping hand should be a business decision based on financials and business sense, not an emotional one. SIA should explore and exhaust all possibilities by themselves first before asking for a government bailout. I look forward to reading the future case study of SIA from Harvard.  On a personal note, I have a different perspective when it comes to choosing airlines. I don't take it because the air stewards and stewardesses are handsome, pretty and professional. Also, not because it is more comfortable. These are just bonuses for me. Rather I look at the company's maintenance standards and their procurement practice. Do they procure the best or better planes or entry level planes? Additionally, I look at the country's diplomacy because even though you could be flying through a safe zone, the nationality of the aircraft company,  plays a BIG part in a safe journey. Just for example, flying on an Israelite civilian airplane over a Hezbollah infested area. It's an extreme case but cited to bring the message across. To me, Singapore is an extremely neutral country therefore I always feel safer in a Singaporean aircraft hence the willingness to pay premium when flying long journeys. I don't really associate this advantage to SIA, rather more to the Singapore brand and its diplomacy efforts.",13.343570190416955

2020,scholarship|awards,"I do not know how the Infosec/Cybersecurity profession views this.  In the accounting profession, any behaviour or action that brings the profession into disrepute (e.g. violating the code of professional conduct and ethics) provides grounds to for the accountant to be kicked out of the profession. Any crime and bankruptcy is automatic grounds for dismissal (under the by-laws) from the profession and one has to go before a disciplinary committee to show cause why the profession should not dismiss him/her from membership in the profession if such misconduct occurred.  How can the company still trust the person's integrity when that person used his professional skills to do illegal acts. If I were a board member for the company that employs him, I would be very concerned on how sure is the supervisor that he will not commit similar crimes or steal from his employer when put in a position of trust?  If you work in the banking sector am sure such serious crimes of computer misuse would bar you from most regulated jobs that needs the various capital market and other licences.
