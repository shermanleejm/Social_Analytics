2016,aptitude|discretionary,"Which university? Which course of study?Aim for a course that best suits you, rather than enrol in the most lucrative one Tan Eng Chye Prof Tan is deputy president (academic affairs) and provost at the National University of Singapore. PUBLISHED 6 HOURS AGOhttp://www.straitstimes.com/singapor...ourse-of-study The university admissions season is in full swing, and this is an exciting time for students in Singapore. The tertiary education landscape here has expanded significantly, and there are now many varied and interesting pathways for students to choose from, from traditional professional degree courses in medicine or engineering, to music and the liberal arts and science. Many parents I met at the National University of Singapore's (NUS) Open Day last month remarked that they are envious of the plethora of choices their children have, and wish to be young once more. Some of you may have secured multiple offers from different universities in Singapore and overseas, and you will have to make an acceptance decision soon. But how should one decide? Every year, the Ministry of Education publishes the employment rates and median starting salaries of fresh graduates of the different degree programmes offered by local universities. I certainly hope students do not make decisions based solely on data obtained through the Graduate Employment Survey (GES). GES data provides an indication of starting salaries. Starting salaries are but a guide; they neither set the course nor determine one's career trajectory or destiny. In this volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous or ""Vuca"" world, one cannot predict the future or where the lucrative jobs will be. You would therefore want your university education to equip you with broad-based life skills, and develop you with the flexibility and resilience needed to pick up new knowledge, adapt to new circumstances, and exploit job opportunities across a variety of sectors throughout your lifetime of careers. Another consideration is whether and how the university course adds value to your educational journey. Some students (and parents) may look to university rankings as a measure of the strength of a university department. And there are definitely synergies between research and education. If the university department excels in research, and counts world-leading researchers in the field, it is likely that cutting-edge research will filter through to your learning experience. You will have the opportunity to be taught by highly regarded academics, and there will be plenty of opportunities to conduct research under the who's-who in the field. This is particularly valuable if you have a very strong interest in research or academia. Choosing a university that excels in your area of interest may also open up more specialised opportunities, such as advanced facilities, academic opportunities such as overseas study or research trips, as well as internships and employment opportunities with prestigious organisations in the industry. Beyond academic reputation, your choice of university will also affect your life intellectually, socially and professionally. You should evaluate the entire student experience, and whether it will suit you. Find out if the social setting on campus is what you would want to be part of. NUS has, for example, the Yale-NUS College and the University Town Residential College programmes, which offer an integrated living and learning experience, amid a collegial and intellectually vibrant setting. Another distinctive programme is the NUS Overseas Colleges programme, where students get to live, work and study in an entrepreneurial hub such as Silicon Valley, New York City or Stockholm, taking entrepreneurship classes at a partner university while working in promising entrepreneurial start-ups. All universities have carefully developed their own suite of programmes and it is worth your time and effort to find out what is on offer. Talk to the professors, and to current students. Universities hold Open Days and various outreach sessions where you can visit the campus and get first-hand information. The best-ranked university or the programme that offers you two degrees in the shortest duration may sound attractive, but they may not necessarily be what you are looking for.  Some of you may want an intensely academic experience, and to pick up as many degrees in the shortest possible time. Yet others may prefer to develop a broader range of capabilities, to try out new things, or to pursue more varied experiences. You should aim to identify a university and a course that best suits you, and not simply enrol in the most competitive or lucrative course. After all, you will be spending your next three to four years in this programme. For those of you whose grades may not meet the degree programme's published entry requirements, do not give up. All local universities have discretionary admissions schemes. Last year, NUS interviewed a record 1,600 students under the scheme, and admitted 670 students. This scheme allows universities to assess applicants more holistically, and to consider their passions and attributes such as leadership, resilience or entrepreneurial skills or talent in non-academic areas. The good news is that from the next academic year onwards, NUS, Nanyang Technological University and Singapore Management University can take in more students under the Discretionary Admissions Scheme, from 10 per cent of the annual intake currently, to up to 15 per cent. This will enable more students to enter universities on the basis of their strengths and talents, beyond academic performance. There is no perfect university. What is key is to make a considered decision with the resources and information that are available to you. Your degree should help start you on the journey to where you want to go. The knowledge, experiences and opportunities in your university life should also prepare you for life beyond your degree. As a student in Singapore, you will have up to the beginning of June to decide on your offers from most of the local universities. Whatever you eventually decide on, make the most of your university experience because, for many, it will be the best time of your life.",14.564864406602128
2016,aptitude|discretionary,"SINGAPORE: Three of Singapore's autonomous universities are refining the way they admit students under the Discretionary Admissions Scheme, which looks beyond a person's academic achievements. It comes as the universities prepare to take in more students under the scheme, when the current cap of 10 per cent allowed for discretionary admissions goes up to 15 per cent next year. ADVERTISING inRead invented by Teads National University of Singapore (NUS) is offering 7,000 places for the coming academic year, but it has received four times the number of applicants. While it has started handing out offers to those who made the cut based on their grades, about 1,800 students who did not are undergoing interviews to be considered for discretionary admissions this year. NUS has been evaluating and admitting more students under the scheme over the years. Last year, it evaluated 1,600 students, 400 more than 2014. 670 of them got in, 70 more than 2014. With more students expected to be considered for discretionary admissions, the process at NUS may be refined. Said Professor Tan Eng Chye, deputy president of academic affairs at NUS: “We are evolving; for instance, we have gotten alumni to help us with the interviews. I find that very useful because the alumni have a lot of experience in sizing up people and candidates, and they ask very useful questions. “We also provide more data on what to look out for and if the numbers get to be big, we may decide that maybe we can have sort of a test first - not an academic test per se, but perhaps a test to look at other non-academic aspects of that person. It could be an aptitude test.” Prof Tan added: “Exercising flexibility is one aspect; you also have to be fairly sharp on what to look for - it is not simply: 'OK, meet the numbers.' Our interest is to look for attributes of the applicants that would make the student community more interesting, more diversified, and enhance the interaction within the student community. “Those who can adequately and can eloquently convey their passions and interests - that would be advantageous. But we also have to look out for students who may not be able to communicate as well, but yet they have the potential for us to groom them to be able graduates.” At the Singapore Management University (SMU), discretionary admissions currently form about 5 to 8 per cent of the annual intake. With the higher cap of 15 per cent for such admissions next year, the university will have ""more leeway"" when assessing students. Professor Pang Yang Hoong, vice provost for undergraduate matters and student development at SMU, said: “For SMU, looking at students with other qualifications is not something terribly new because we always been holistic in the way we assess students and their suitability for admission. We will be more flexible. “(We look for) passion, the aptitude for the course for which we are admitting them into. It would also be ideal if students have demonstrated that they are successful to be in time management, that they also possess resilience and the ability to overcome difficult situations. This will help us to assess if that person has got the resilience and the determination to do well in the programme.” SMU is expecting more polytechnic graduates to apply through the discretionary route with the cap being raised to 15 per cent of the annual intake. Nanyang Technological University (NTU) will also ""broaden the criteria"", to give more people a shot at securing a place. It will favourably consider those who possess ""enthusiasm and relevant work experience"". Professor Kam Chan Hin, senior associate provost for undergraduate education at NTU, commented: “Normally, they will look at other achievements that they have - whether in sports, in arts … or even if they are very passionate about community service, leadership. So these are the things that we usually look for. “We are going to encourage all the schools to broaden the criteria, to allow more people who have a very strong passion, to be given the opportunity to be interviewed. We should be more adventurous, open it a bit more and ask more questions, outside of the usual parameters, and if you find somebody who is really very interesting and very passionate … give them a chance.” NTU had evaluated 1,400 students under the scheme last year and about 600 were given a place. All three universities said that even as they exercise flexibility, it is still important for students to show that they possess the ""adequate academic competence"" to go through the rigour and demands of a university education.  - CNA/ms",13.30648148897031

NBS is out of the question (competitive to the core) The rest you have to gauge on what you like and how realistic your chances are. Take a look at the Appeal Chance Rater if you haven't - HSS courses are damn popular for some reason Your mission in this appeal is to play safe and appeal to the course in which you think you have the most chance of getting it to; you don't have the luxury of appealing to the courses with higher GPA because you said before that you have been rejected from NTU altogether and you don't know whether SMU will accept you or not.

I am not sure which country ure from (i assume malaysia), and honestly the reason in you choosing to study in Singapore as oppose to your own country is because we have a better and more stable education system in Singapore. Singapore in comparison, do have a fair intake of foreign students on a global scale. Why don't I hear you talking about other unis in other countries? Have you even looked at the US?  Local unis rank well globally as well as having competitive costs, making it a hot spot for foreigners.  NS aside, if the unis in Malaysia are better than singapore, im pretty sure many of us will gladly flock over for our education. Also to note, singaporeans are alr angered by the huge rise in foreigners for employment, and now having to know that the govt is offering our tax payers money only to attract foreign 'talents' to study here, and have them 'MIA' or jumping to an mnc and getting the bond paid off by the company, definitely do not sit well with us. talent, refers to high aptitude; cream of the crop",11.000314691925391

Basically it was a short 10 to 15 mins interview for me. The first thing they asked was why I chose it. For me, PFM was one of my last few choices.. I think the 4th? I explained that it was because of its practicality and stuff. Then they asked how much I know about the course etc and why I chose to put it higher up compared to RE (my 5th choice). They also discussed about like my other choices for other universities. Like erm if they offer me and then NTU offered me my choice, would i choose PFM or NTU Econs (my 1st choice). At that point in time I had decided NTU econs wasnt for me la, so I just said truthfully that yeah I would take PFM. Then they asked whether I had any questions about the course etc. The interviewers (there were 3) quite friendly. The prof, asst prof and one more was the one who sent me the email for the DA interview. Most of the time the prof was the one asking, while the rest took down notes or something...??  I went for this on 20 May. Then on 27 May i received the offer. I not sure why i was given the opportunity in the first place cause my DA also not v outstanding. They also didnt mention what i wrote for the achievements part... From what I heard from my other friends who went for DA interviews as well, they also got discuss how they can contribute and study hard even though a level results not exactly ideal Anyways... i accepted the pfm offer, but 2nd acceptance window came and NTU offered me PPGA so I took that instead....hahah.

By that I refer to past scholarships, being from ""elite"" schools, IP track, qualifying for 4H2s etc. I know some may find it unfair towards students who worked hard to get a good A-level cert despite their history, but if I'm not wrong, poly students are considered for their O level results as well right? I'm not even eyeing the competitive courses, just desperate to get into local uni ): My RP is only 67.5 Sorry to burst your bubble, but 'past scholarships', 'being from ""elite"" schools', 'IP track' and 'qualifying for 4H2s' were merely rewards for your past academic achievements in the PSLE. It's a one-time ticket only. If the ""stellar academic achievements"" you're referring to are Olympiad medals, or some form of prestigious international award, then you may wish to consider applying via Discretionary Admissions. The local university admissions criteria is simple. JC/IP students apply with their A level certification.

Saying so is discrediting the professors that work hard to design the program.  The ramp up is fast I admit, but thats the nature of computer science ask anyone in nus/ntu comp sci or smu is, they will tell you the same thing. The first semester subject starts the knowledge train from SCRATCH. If you don't believe me, ask the famous yanying/guyz92 to send you the first few lectures for 1002, which module title is literally programming fundamentals.  I challenge anyone who has seen that to tell me that its not meant for someone with 0 background in coding. The professors themselves reiterate in the first lecture to tell us not to worry if you have no background because they will teach the basics to you. Agreed on the part for ICT1002 Programming Fundamental, Python is for beginners to learn as var in Python is loosely assign, don't have to care about memory allocation etc. Once student touch C will be another extreme. Memory allocation now is important, assigning var with wrong format and precision will cause C application to crash.

If you are unlucky that 2 of out of 4 teammates not contribute much, you will having the feeling of a sinking boat. Just a project in ICT1004 implement all this different language.  If you are totally new to programming, having ICT1001 supplement these knowledge such as SQL query statement. ICT1001 doesn't teach how to write stored procedure and other more advanced SQL statement such as left join, right join, union etc, while project if you know these trick, it can decrease the burden of writing inefficient codes. Also freeloader in ICT is another problem, playing taichi and act blur not contributing to project while others doing the project, they use the time to study for class test and exam.

2018,aptitude|discretionary,"According to NTU (http://www3.ntu.edu.sg/oad2/website_files/DA.pdf), one of the criteria they consider for DA is “significant awards/achievements in area relevant to the programme applied”, so yes, as long as your scholarship and internship is relevant to the course/(s), I think it *should* count as an achievement.  You should also ask the GM of ur internship firm to be ur appraiser for DA (see document link for more info). Anyway, really no harm in applying for DA, so just give it a shot and see what happens  As for how to write the essay, I remember being asked to write about a meaningful experience OR why I was applying to a particular course/NTU. Whichever topic you chose, I suggest telling it as a cohesive story. ‘Link’ your achievements into it and how it has contributed to you choosing this course/NTU. Listicals of ur achievements can be quite hard to read, and the admissions committee obviously has to read many of them. If your essay is entertaining and insightful too, I think you’ll stand a decent chance of being read/called up for at least an interview.

2020,aptitude|discretionary,"We haven't had an updated version for some time after the latest GES was released. Now this is one of the kinds of analysis that when interpreting the visualisation you must have in mind a few caveats. Although it is generally advised not to pick a course solely on remuneration, undoubtedly some are willing to sacrifice their happiness working in a field they later find they dislike for a higher pay, and this is their decision.   That being said, this plot is still interesting enough although with a few important things to note:  \- 10% IGP is not the minimum and may be a good measure, but A lvl Rank points does not solely determine the difficulty of entrance for some courses. Especially for courses with interviews, it is quite often the case where the real difficulty lies in passing the interview and not the RP filtering stage  \- For 85 RP courses, it is obvious that quite a few could, and will be greater than 85 RP. This is just a result of the published IGPs holding GP to be a 'C' grade, a decision made by the universities/MOE.  \- This does not take into account non-normal admission like discretionary admission scheme  \- <Honour> variants of the majors were assumed to have the same IGP. If this does not seem to make sense do point out!  \- Horizontal and Vertical lines are the major-wise mean of the courses analysed here. If your major is not here, it must have meant I could not obtain the data for either dimension.  \- One last thing to add is that starting salary is not necessarily the best measure for some majors. For one example, accountancy is known to have lower starting pay but more well-known for its increment/progression. So do take note of this.  \- Business Analytics is from Computing but it is a Bachelor of Science  \- the usual problems for GES in general still apply, like reporting bias, sample size etc. (although all here are >30, but that's still not significantly big).  \- Decided to do for gross starting remuneration but basic could also hold some insights.  \- For obvious reasons, there is a 3/4 year lag between the latest batch(IGP) and the batch whose GES was considered.  &#x200B;  Data was taken from MOE at: [https://www.moe.gov.sg/docs/default-source/document/education/post-secondary/files/web-publication-nus-ges-2019.pdf](https://www.moe.gov.sg/docs/default-source/document/education/post-secondary/files/web-publication-nus-ges-2019.pdf)  Some footnotes copy and pasted from their report:  ""  6. Data on law, medicine and pharmacy graduates is obtained from a follow-up survey on 2018 graduates after they have completed their  one-year practical law course/pupillage/housemanship/first-year residency/practical training. Data on architecture graduates is  obtained from a follow-up survey on 2016 architecture graduates after they have completed their practical training.  7. The Bachelor of Environmental Studies degree is a multidisciplinary programme that allows students to specialise in either  Environmental Biology within the Faculty of Science or Environmental Geography within the Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences.  8. \*: Data is based on a sample size of fewer than 30 respondents. ""  &#x200B;  For more caveats, take a look at their the link above, their report is quite comprehensive for most intents and purposes.

2020,aptitude|discretionary,"The university admission season is in full swing.  It is timely to reflect on whether admission processes can be improved to manage the increased diversity of prospective university students.  I am a recent graduate from the National University of Singapore’s (NUS) Master of Architecture programme from the polytechnic route.  But I initially faced significant challenges securing a place in local universities, though I came third in my interior architecture diploma from Temasek Polytechnic, one of two diplomas recognised by the Board of Architects Singapore for training waivers.  NUS and the Singapore University of Technology and Design rejected my application and appeals for admission to their bachelor’s degrees in architecture.  My grade point average (GPA) as the third-highest-scoring student was not enough to even land me an interview under a discretionary admissions scheme.  An appeal letter from a Member of Parliament was the saving grace that secured me an interview. I was offered a place in the NUS bachelor’s degree in architecture in 2015 and completed it in 2018. I finished the master’s course last year.  It was disquieting to observe, for instance, that students from Singapore Polytechnic’s environment-design-related diplomas disproportionately dominated the pool of polytechnic students in the bachelor’s and master’s courses in architecture at NUS.  My checks in 2015 revealed that the GPA of the bottom 10th percentile of polytechnic students admitted to the architecture programme was higher than that of the top scorer from my Temasek Polytechnic diploma cohort. This raises the question of whether it is equitable to use the polytechnic GPA as a standard for admission to courses in local universities.     While the A-Level examinations provide a level playing field for junior college students, can we assume that the GPAs between polytechnics are a similar and fair equivalent for our polytechnic students?  Do not get me wrong. This is not a public appeal to increase places for polytechnic students. It is about ensuring that these limited seats go to the best students from the various polytechnics.  Can the Ministry of Education clarify if there are measures to ensure similar levels of rigour in the curricula of diploma courses from the different polytechnics?  And is there a similar standard for assessment and grading?  The current practice in some diploma courses to invite university academics to review the work of their final-year students is commendable and should be better structured to serve as an objective means of assessing the competence of students.    An additional GPA score, perhaps moderated at a national level and reflective of the student’s position in his course, can help universities more fairly process these applications.  Polytechnics should also publish the proportion of their diploma graduates who enter local universities, so that prospective students can make informed choices. Students who are certain that they want to pursue further education after their diplomas can thus better gauge which course will offer them the best chances.",10.748002257422776
