2020,hair,"I'm in a US city which has not (yet) been hit hard. Have not been sleeping well these few days, so quality of writing will be quite cui. All institutes of higher learning or schools for that matter have been ordered to move classes online. Restaurants only allow you to dabao food, not eat in. Everyone is advised to stay in as far as possible. I've not been out for almost a week, and only left once in the past 12 days to stock up on even more food (I've got at least 1-2 months of supplies).  It's a tough situation for us students. The general opinion here is very mixed. To start off, the term \`student' is quite heavily overloaded, since the considerations of undergrads, masters, exchange, PhD students are all very different. For exchange students or students who are graduating this semester, coming back is almost certainly the right thing to do, *unless* you have a job lined up after graduation. That one is a bit of a grey area, especially if you chose to do your degree in the states precisely because you wanted a job there.  For PhD students, research is pretty much our job (no holidays btw). If you have to work in a physical lab, then things could get sticky. Fortunately, I study CS and hence am lucky enough to be able to pretty much work from home without any disruption. At any rate, that was pretty much my life before the virus outbreak. Advisors are generally very sympathetic and are willing to pay (sometimes out of their own pocket) for students to buy webcams/tablets etc. Things vary from person to person, but I can't imagine advisors turning down requests to fly home in a time like this. That said, bear in mind its not quite right for us to ""just stop playing and leave"", since that is akin to quitting your *job* without notice.  For most of us, the considerations are  1. Chance of contracting the virus while staying vs. Risk of contracting it en-route home. This is hard to judge, since most of us are well prepared to hunker down for months. Contrast this with going home, which means going through Newark or SFO, two huge danger zones. 2. Quality of health services (taking into account possible overload of health services) vs. that in Singapore. Here, SG wins hands down. 3. Logistical issues. How do we re-enter after (and if) this whole thing dies down? How will our visas be handled? Typically student visas expire after several months of not re-entering the states. Will we ever be able to graduate? 4. Productivity. WFH sounds great, especially for nerdy, introverted CS people. (I can literally root myself in my comfortable gaming chair all day!) But in reality, my productivity has never been lower. Not only is there this constant barrage of CV-related news (I follow the situation in both SG and US), the recent advisories for the past few days made me lose even more sleep. It's really difficult to concentrate when you keep second guessing your own decisions, which explains why I'm on reddit now. Maybe if I flew back, I'd lose less sleep and actually be more productive.  IF the US had stayed on the same course as it was a week ago, then leaving is obviously the better option. But my state and city have at least *some* primitive measures to flatten the curve,  so that makes the decision a bit tougher.  Addendum: Also, spoke to my Chinese peers and their concerns are generally the same, though (3) is obviously a more major one.  Edits: grammar, writing  Edit2: I also want to add that MFA, MOE etc have been extremely helpful to all of us during this period, especially with procedures and what to expect if we chose to go back. Singaporeans get updates every few hours, which are disseminated through whatsapp/Telegram chats. Would want to thank them from the bottom of my heart for their services in these tough times, hopefully one of them sees this.",14.55570220735007
2020,hair,"   Singapore is now in the final stages of sealing a deal for its first  next-generation stealth fighter jets, joining 12 other countries who are  set to receive or currently operate the F-35 Joint Strike Fighters.  Singapore will buy four F-35Bs and evaluate them fully before  committing to a further eight, said Defence Minister Ng Eng Hen last  Monday. The first planes will be based in the United States for training  and evaluation, with delivery expected in 2026.  The US government in January gave the green light for the sale of up  to a dozen elite stealth fighter jets and related equipment to Singapore  for US$2.75 billion (S$3.79 billion). Dr Ng told Parliament last week  that the US Congress has approved the sale as well.  The Straits Times answers some remaining questions about Singapore's F-35 acquisition.  #### Q Why does delivery take six years?  **A** Other than having to clear the backlog of orders  from other countries, defence journalist Mike Yeo said Singapore could  itself have requested the 2026 delivery date to meet its own schedules  for introducing the F-35 into the Republic of Singapore Air Force  (RSAF). ""Another reason could be the potential for further reduction in  acquisition and operating costs at that time, given the F-35 will be  firmly established by then,"" he added.  In the past, it has taken other foreign countries about five years between finalising the deal and delivery of the planes.  For instance, Belgium officially selected 34 F-35As in 2018, with the first deliveries expected in 2023.  Japan announced its decision to buy 42 F-35s in 2011 and received its first planes in 2016.  #### Q Where will the first F-35s be based?  **A** Mr Yeo, who writes for Defense News website,  believes there are three air force bases in the US that are likely  candidates: Marine Corps Air Station (MCAS) Yuma in Arizona, MCAS  Miramar in California and MCAS Beaufort in South Carolina.  The Luke Air Force Base in Arizona, where international F-35 training  is conducted and where the RSAF's Peace Carvin II F-16 detachment is  based, operates the F-35A model, noted Mr Yeo, and thus might not be  useful to the RSAF's F-35Bs.  ""The most obvious reason for basing in the US for training and  evaluation is of course the availability of training airspace and less  restrictions on it.  ""The second reason is basing in the US allows the RSAF to leverage on  the US military's experience and infrastructure in operating the  (F-35B) which would allow the RSAF to adopt the established best  practices for training and operating the F-35B and its unique  capabilities,"" he added.  The US Marine Corps is the only US armed service to also operate the  F-35B, which can take off from a shorter runway and land vertically.  #### Q Why did Singapore place a small initial order for four F-35s, with an option for eight more?  **A** Mr Ben Ho, an airpower analyst with the S.  Rajaratnam School of International Studies, said this reflected  Singapore's gradualist and evolutionary approach towards defence  acquisition.  ""The Republic's modus operandi in this regard has usually been this:  make a limited purchase, slowly ease in the capability while  fastidiously assess its effectiveness and level of integration. Only  when the F-35B has been truly bedded into the RSAF/SAF edifice would  another purchase be considered.""  He noted that while Singapore's first purchase of its F-15s in 2005  was larger with 12 aircraft and an option for eight more, that plane had  ""an enviable decades-long operational record by then"".  ""The same cannot be said of the F-35 at this stage, given that it was  first deployed for operations - with the US military - only in recent  years. This lack of a track record may be key in explaining Singapore's  cautious F-35 buy,"" he added.  Dr Ng had also suggested, in response to a question by Workers' Party  chairman and Aljunied GRC MP Sylvia Lim last Monday, that further  evaluation was important before Singapore commits to a full fleet.  The minister said Singapore was ""in no hurry"" to buy the F-35s, as  the F-15SGs and F-16s are adequate for its air defence and capabilities.  ""We (will) evaluate them fully, including all the questions that were  attributed to the F-35s including costs and maintenance, before we  decide fully on a full fleet of F-35s.""  #### Q Would Singapore still buy the ""A"" variant?  **A** While some have pointed out that the F-35B variant  is more pricey and has lower range and payload compared to the ""A""  model, analysts have said the F-35B's short takeoff and landing  capabilities could allow them to take off from temporary highway strips  should the RSAF's fixed-wing facilities be taken out.  Mr Ho of RSIS said it would make sense to consider the ""A"" model,  which is cheaper and technically less complex. For instance, it can  carry a larger payload and also strike targets from further away than  the ""B"" variant.  ""It is therefore conceivable that the F-35A could be in RSAF service  one day - and this would arguably be well into the 2030s and beyond. By  then, the cost of the F-35 should have gone down significantly and its  problems rectified.""",13.934995090658926

2020,hair,"Uhhh honestly, whoever you are Mr Alex Tan (I have never heard of you tbvh) this ""strategy"" has various flaws.  As seen in the recent ~~gerrymandering exercise~~ reorganisation of constituencies and electoral boundaries, a number of opposition parties actually lost by a narrow margin. Around 40% in the some SMCs. The idea of penalising them for losing by such a close margin is absolutely absurd. Honestly penalising parties for losing is absurd itself. It just squanders the opportunity for a party to slowly gather supporters in the area, which is kind of the general process of getting support. Look at other countries' elections. Opposition parties who have garnered support of the majority have typically contested **in the same area** for quite a few prior elections, building up supporters as they grow. I don't think the opposition will have any chance of people trusting them if every GE, its a new party that would come around to contest the area. Would anyone vote for that? I doubt so.  By tiering the opposition parties, good job. I would cheer for you. ""G double-O D J O B Good Job! Good Job!"" You have successfully pissed off probably every single opposition party in the tier 4 and tier 3 ""list"". Seriously, even though everyone knows that the Workers Party is the strongest opposition party in Singapore, no one likes being told that not only that you aren't the best, yeah, there's people better than you and you're the worst actually, which is essentially what he is doing by tiering them. Seriously. WHY?  Also, regarding the part of you regarding people who don't comply with your statements enemies and threatening them. Wow. You sound like a dictator. Like honestly, would anyone want to work with him after that? I think the opposition parties probably see working with him tarnishing their image rather than helping them. They would be better off working together, but just without this guy 'leading' them. Why? So all the threats he made (if he acts on them) will just be seen as someone spewing rubbish, and probably everyone will ignore them.  Finally, I would like to just state this. Now is not the time to do prepare for an election. Not like this. All the decisions on which locations to contest should have been done months ago when the government first started hinting about elections. Preparing like this now would only show that the opposition in SG is disorganised. They should be in the finalising stage and tweaking their plans to fit with the new GRCs and SMCs being announced.  PS: I just looked him up. He is in Australia. I would honestly think that he would be on hand to walk around and get the general demographic of the people and who they may be supporting, and why. I wouldn't trust an armchair general who is 4500km away with ""leading the strategies"". I don't necessarily agree with the PAP's actions such as gerrymandering and making it difficult for opposition to emerge, but if the opposition in SG does decide to let this guy dictate their strategies, I would rather stick with the PAP, and I think many others will think likewise as well.

2020,hair,"I personally don't have much of a story but my sister and my mum have a somewhat estranged relationship as a result of my mother's need to control due to her immense insecurity.  You see, my sister and my mother are complete opposites of each other to an almost unbelievable level. My mum is petite sized, my sis is 1.65m tall and a pseudo bodybuilder. My mum was brought up to be ""ladylike"", my sis is a ""tomboy"" at heart. My mum is soft spoken, my sis is more brash in her expression. My mum is a naturally timid person, my sis is a daredevil. My mum prioritizes feeling safe and secure, my sis wants independence, is ambitious, competitive, has a headstrong personality and constantly thirst for new adventures and experiences in life. My mum's reaction to a problem is to get anxious, my sis immediately assumes the role of 大姐 (big sister) and seeks to solve it. Not quite a winning pair of combination eh?  So as you can imagine, conflicts abound between them since she was young. My mum, owing to her upbringing constantly tells my sis to ""wear skirts, do girly things, refine your tone, no staying out late, no engaging in ""dangerous activities"", beware ""dirty men"" etc etc"". My sis of course wasn't interested in being girly or being restricted just by virtue of being a female and even more so that she's in her mid 20s now. There were frequent quarrels over choice of fashion, hair colour, her after school schedule, where she went and who she's meeting, speech, relationships and her preference for playing Lego over barbie when young. As she grew up and became more independent, the gap between them widened as my mum realises her gradual loss of control over my sister. Against my mother's wishes, she took up bodybuilding/powerlifting/combat sports etc, became a personal trainer , became a social drinker due to job, has gone on multiple mountain hiking trips overseas and loves it, got a motorbike license AND a motorbike, going out to meet friends at night etc etc. You can only imagine the horror on my mother's face and her desperate attempts to nag, employ guilt trip tactics, try or even ask me and my dad to ""dissuade your sister/daughter"" each time my sis goes off on her own to do all of these things my mum deems ""unacceptable because it is either ""not something girls should do"", hurts her feelings, or makes her worried/scared and unsafe and therefore it's bad for everyone. All of us in the family has had arguments with my mum over various things, but my sis holds the record due to just her not giving a crap.  Tldr: Insecure, controlling ladylike ""muh feelings"" mum meets her match in tomboyish, rebellious sister who doesn't give a single sh!t about pandering to feelings.",10.215123682994458
