And what's with the BIZ anal flip class room thing. really makes me feel like flipping table instead. lol but nus biz is copying smu in some ways. even our profs are comparing. NUS biz is surely harder to score. NBS average bellcurve lies at around B+ while NUS biz lies around B. Not to mention the accountancy cohort of NUS is 3 times smaller than NBS with people of much higher GPA/ Rank point going in.averagewee wrote:  eh not sure leh. for my sectional group we all like competitive in class but outside class like alright leh. So far nobody has ever throw my notes away leh. But i heard stories from senior that there are people who don't even teach their friends as they think it's damn stupid to help them due to the bellcurve. Personal feeling, people who refuses to teach generally do not score very well hence they feel insecure. For any of the peeps here, whatever course you go to, ignore the bell curve and teach. Nothing aid learning better than teaching your peers.averagewee wrote:  so far i haven't memorize anything for biz leh. Mostly got cheatsheet and biz cannot really memorize la. need quite a lot of critical thinking in some way. Biz in uni is quite different from poly in some way. Agreed, it works for NBS too. Not much memorization need with so many mod having open book and cheatsheet. Mods that i memorised generally only score a B+ or so because i fail to understand the concepts. Mod that i score A/ A+ hardly require much memorising since I get the concepts. Main point is that in Uni learn to understand and not memorise, non of the dean listers I see uses pure memory. People who say that mugging can give you your first class honors totally discount the understanding part.,11.364789508769444

Congrats on being shortlisted for SMU SIS interview! First and foremost, you can find numerous blogs and forums with information about the interview. That aside, I've just went for the interview on 9th April and have just received an acceptance email today. So I will be actually telling you what to expect for the interview but it may differ. Firstly, it is a group interview which  consists of 2 interviewers (professors) and 6 interviewees including you. Upon arrival, you will be led to a room by current SIS student volunteers where they will brief you through the interview progress. You will then be given 15 minutes to complete a form whereby you have to state specific examples of certain characteristics and traits (eg. Leadership, curiosity etc). On the same form you have to list down 3 questions you wanna ask the professors. Another 15 minutes will be given to you to design (sketch on a black paper) a Web page depending on the case study. Once completed, you will be led to another room where the interviewers will already be seated. One by one, you have to present your design to everybody. Do expect some questions to be asked by the professors pertaining to your design.  Next comes the famous SMU estimation question and you have 4 minutes to write down your answer on a piece of paper. The question I received was, "How many A4 sized papers are used for exam questions in SMU per semester." They do not care about your final answer but are more concern on your thought process. So make realistic and sound assumptions before arriving to your final answer. The professors may ask the origin of your assumption. So make sure you know how to explain. Lastly, the interview will end of with a Q&A session whereby questions you have listed on earlier will be answered. Do not list down questions which can be easily found on SMU's website.  Be confident and show your passion towards IS while presenting your ideas. SMU SIS looks for students who are able to analyse problems fast with critical thinking skills. As long as you make an effort to prepare for the interview, you have won half of the battle. With that,  I wish you all the best for the interview Hi, went for the same interview on 18th of March(think maybe first batch), but until now still no news lol? does it mean I will be rejected bro??,11.05415162274395

Okay lah, NTU did give me an interview for NAA then, but I was young, fresh out of school and had a really naive impression of the world. Also, back then, I barely had a year's worth of working experience, so when the interviewers bombarded me with questions, they basically stepped all over me ... I walked out of the room feeling dejected and at that point, it sank in that the odds stacked against me in getting a place in university were really high.   So for the past three years, I've been slogging my wits out at work at the same company (pretty reputable), and I do have some tiny accomplishments to show. I felt that if I was granted a chance to present myself, I would definitely be much better than in 2011, so I decided to give it another shot this year. Also haha, because zeh zeh old liao, need to go back to school, if not it's now or never. True enough, this year, I got called for two interviews, but I don't know the application results yet. Could answer the interview questions better with more matured viewpoints, but of course, was also thrown a few curveball questions such as, "Why do you intend to go back to school since you've already entered the workforce?" Hopefully I explained myself well enough to the interviewers, so can only hope for the best now.  Hahaha sorry for this terribly long post, but for all the poly kids who got rejected ... may my story remind you that it's definitely not the end, so don't give up ... You still have a few years to try for a place in local uni. In the meantime, you can always find a job like I did and work for a few years first. I have found that it can be equally, if not more, rewarding. Anyone remembers this zehzeh?  I GOT MY OFFER FOR NTU SOCIOLOGY today!

Congrats on being shortlisted for SMU SIS interview! First and foremost, you can find numerous blogs and forums with information about the interview. That aside, I've just went for the interview on 9th April and have just received an acceptance email today. So I will be actually telling you what to expect for the interview but it may differ. Firstly, it is a group interview which  consists of 2 interviewers (professors) and 6 interviewees including you. Upon arrival, you will be led to a room by current SIS student volunteers where they will brief you through the interview progress. You will then be given 15 minutes to complete a form whereby you have to state specific examples of certain characteristics and traits (eg. Leadership, curiosity etc). On the same form you have to list down 3 questions you wanna ask the professors. Another 15 minutes will be given to you to design (sketch on a black paper) a Web page depending on the case study. Once completed, you will be led to another room where the interviewers will already be seated. One by one, you have to present your design to everybody. Do expect some questions to be asked by the professors pertaining to your design.  Next comes the famous SMU estimation question and you have 4 minutes to write down your answer on a piece of paper. The question I received was, "How many A4 sized papers are used for exam questions in SMU per semester." They do not care about your final answer but are more concern on your thought process. So make realistic and sound assumptions before arriving to your final answer. The professors may ask the origin of your assumption. So make sure you know how to explain. Lastly, the interview will end of with a Q&A session whereby questions you have listed on earlier will be answered. Do not list down questions which can be easily found on SMU's website.  Be confident and show your passion towards IS while presenting your ideas. SMU SIS looks for students who are able to analyse problems fast with critical thinking skills. As long as you make an effort to prepare for the interview, you have won half of the battle.

Cheeyarn, you may wish to take note of the above point^. This reason may prove to be true for some NTU courses.

I took amaths and economics during my secondary and poly time respectively. I also applied for nus fass for the previous 2 years, but they rejected me too which i dunno why.  Could it be the reason that i am serving ns now? I kinda at a loss about what to do. I dont really wanna go SIM with my gpa! No! In fact, NS should be an advantage especially if you get into command school! (That is also considered a non-accademic achievement) Other awards like best soldier may help too! NS is the best time to talk about your experiences and what made you decide (forgive me if I sound too drama or cliche) on going into that dream course! NTU/NUS/SMU requires students to write more about themselves for the courses they require to get into/why and there is a portion for non-accademic achievements. Remember to fill that up! Don't think it is not important because there are many people with the same GPA as you, so how do they consider applicants? To see if they have any additional talents/achievements they can bring with them outside their GPA!!! I cannot stress this enough, especially if you are from a poly! Also, I feel you about not being able to get into a local university of my choice! I screwed up my admission to get into my several dream courses at various Local U's during the first year because I thought they only look at GPA, and hence I didn't really bother much with the interview/and did not fill my non-CCA achievements. I thought I would definitely secure a place butI was so FRIGGIN WRONG. I felt like I was going to die literally because I couldn't get into a Local U. It was awful because I worked so friggin hard in poly D': Fortunately, I managed to pull myself together and manage to not screw up the second time and got into a local U with a course of my choice  So, DONT GIVE UP BRO. Now that you are closer to ORD, find some time to improve yourself, hunt down your poly lecturer to write you that testimonial letter for your university admission as they will really help. You are a merit holder, I am sure you have worked hard for it and paid attention during leessons. Your lecturers 会给你面子 if you are sincere and ask nicely!   If all else fails, there is always a local university route outside of NTU/NUS and it can be even better than the two.. but I can't say here.. later people will think I am biased towards certain university...

Not sure if you are really from NBS. People study yes, mug day and night no. Average AUs per sem is around 17, can't see why you complaining. Each mod at most have 1 week of Elearning. I took blaw before and I don't remember any streaming video whatsoever. Recorded lecture is made available only to aid students who miss / have doubt after the lectures. NUS cannot choose their specialisation as what they wish, CAP is still a consideration. So far the only subject I have trouble understanding the lecturer is stats, most prof are Singaporean and speak rather well. Also, I survive 80% of my modules without the textbooks, notes are generally sufficient. Lastly, I have more NUS friends regretting not coming NBS instead. I can say with certainty NUS acc is way more competitive.,11.88705969791027

I think you shouldn't get too caught up with reputation right now, it is something that shouldn't take precedence over your interests and your desired career - mainly because it isn't as important as you think it is. I've a senior, an IP student from one of the top JCs who scored straight B's for his A levels did not get called for an interview for his 1st nor 2nd choice at SMU. Fella decided to go to SIM to pursue his studies in a similar field and is earning quite a lot working as a trader for a fund now.  There are a lot of ways you can monetize your degree - as long as you are doing what you want to do you will think of ways to do so. If you're going to do Jap studies but you're interested in Finance, then do take some finance mods if that is possible, join a finance CCA, take up CFA, participate in competitions, write a paper on Japan and show your employer that you are well versed with Jap culture and at the same time highly passionate (and active) in the finance side of things - you will be an amazing hire for a company looking to expand into / their operations in Japan.  It is important for us not to get caught up with the rankings. I cannot stress this enough - at the end of the day, it is who you are, what you've done and how you're working towards your goals that matter, not the reputation of your University.  Just to share: the decision for me was simple back then - I've sorted out my interests, understood what I needed to do... so I picked the one that's closest to where I live  And my parents are both members of KRGH so that made the choice even more obvious! Thanks for the great advice!  I am offered to do Linguistics in NTU, and it's a more attractive offer now especially since I am offered a scholarship there. The truth is, I love languages, and I'm obsessed with Japanese as well. Been learning the language since P5, over 9 years liao. Been exposed to the culture since I was born, so I am very influenced and in love with it. But still, I don't really see the point in doing Japanese Studies.  I am a Tourism/Business student in NP, so I have both business and hospitality backgrounds to fall upon. I am thinking of being a translator/interpreter, but doing Jap Studies would be pointless since I can't just concentrate on just one language. Being an Eng teacher in Japan would be nice as well, and that would require linguistics studies... The worst thing is, both degrees have one of the lowest starting salary among all the degrees, am now hesitating on whether to appeal to NBS instead... :/ cGPA: ard 3.82 O level: L1R5=4, L1R4=6,11.540850945575315

That aside, I've just went for the interview on 9th April and have just received an acceptance email today. So I will be actually telling you what to expect for the interview but it may differ. Firstly, it is a group interview which  consists of 2 interviewers (professors) and 6 interviewees including you. Upon arrival, you will be led to a room by current SIS student volunteers where they will brief you through the interview progress. You will then be given 15 minutes to complete a form whereby you have to state specific examples of certain characteristics and traits (eg. Leadership, curiosity etc). On the same form you have to list down 3 questions you wanna ask the professors. Another 15 minutes will be given to you to design (sketch on a black paper) a Web page depending on the case study. Once completed, you will be led to another room where the interviewers will already be seated. One by one, you have to present your design to everybody. Do expect some questions to be asked by the professors pertaining to your design.  Next comes the famous SMU estimation question and you have 4 minutes to write down your answer on a piece of paper. The question I received was, "How many A4 sized papers are used for exam questions in SMU per semester." They do not care about your final answer but are more concern on your thought process.

NS is the best time to talk about your experiences and what made you decide (forgive me if I sound too drama or cliche) on going into that dream course! NTU/NUS/SMU requires students to write more about themselves for the courses they require to get into/why and there is a portion for non-accademic achievements. Remember to fill that up! Don't think it is not important because there are many people with the same GPA as you, so how do they consider applicants? To see if they have any additional talents/achievements they can bring with them outside their GPA!!! I cannot stress this enough, especially if you are from a poly! Also, I feel you about not being able to get into a local university of my choice! I screwed up my admission to get into my several dream courses at various Local U's during the first year because I thought they only look at GPA, and hence I didn't really bother much with the interview/and did not fill my non-CCA achievements. I thought I would definitely secure a place butI was so FRIGGIN WRONG. I felt like I was going to die literally because I couldn't get into a Local U. It was awful because I worked so friggin hard in poly D': Fortunately, I managed to pull myself together and manage to not screw up the second time and got into a local U with a course of my choice  So, DONT GIVE UP BRO. Now that you are closer to ORD, find some time to improve yourself, hunt down your poly lecturer to write you that testimonial letter for your university admission as they will really help. You are a merit holder, I am sure you have worked hard for it and paid attention during leessons. Your lecturers 会给你面子 if you are sincere and ask nicely!   If all else fails, there is always a local university route outside of NTU/NUS and it can be even better than the two.. but I can't say here.. later people will think I am biased towards certain university...

Not sure if you are really from NBS. People study yes, mug day and night no. Average AUs per sem is around 17, can't see why you complaining. Each mod at most have 1 week of Elearning. I took blaw before and I don't remember any streaming video whatsoever. Recorded lecture is made available only to aid students who miss / have doubt after the lectures. NUS cannot choose their specialisation as what they wish, CAP is still a consideration. So far the only subject I have trouble understanding the lecturer is stats, most prof are Singaporean and speak rather well. Also, I survive 80% of my modules without the textbooks, notes are generally sufficient. Lastly, I have more NUS friends regretting not coming NBS instead. I can say with certainty NUS acc is way more competitive.,11.875827154394234

I think you shouldn't get too caught up with reputation right now, it is something that shouldn't take precedence over your interests and your desired career - mainly because it isn't as important as you think it is. I've a senior, an IP student from one of the top JCs who scored straight B's for his A levels did not get called for an interview for his 1st nor 2nd choice at SMU. Fella decided to go to SIM to pursue his studies in a similar field and is earning quite a lot working as a trader for a fund now.  There are a lot of ways you can monetize your degree - as long as you are doing what you want to do you will think of ways to do so. If you're going to do Jap studies but you're interested in Finance, then do take some finance mods if that is possible, join a finance CCA, take up CFA, participate in competitions, write a paper on Japan and show your employer that you are well versed with Jap culture and at the same time highly passionate (and active) in the finance side of things - you will be an amazing hire for a company looking to expand into / their operations in Japan.  It is important for us not to get caught up with the rankings. I cannot stress this enough - at the end of the day, it is who you are, what you've done and how you're working towards your goals that matter, not the reputation of your University.  Just to share: the decision for me was simple back then - I've sorted out my interests, understood what I needed to do... so I picked the one that's closest to where I live  And my parents are both members of KRGH so that made the choice even more obvious! Thanks for the great advice!  I am offered to do Linguistics in NTU, and it's a more attractive offer now especially since I am offered a scholarship there. The truth is, I love languages, and I'm obsessed with Japanese as well. Been learning the language since P5, over 9 years liao. Been exposed to the culture since I was born, so I am very influenced and in love with it. But still, I don't really see the point in doing Japanese Studies.  I am a Tourism/Business student in NP, so I have both business and hospitality backgrounds to fall upon. I am thinking of being a translator/interpreter, but doing Jap Studies would be pointless since I can't just concentrate on just one language. Being an Eng teacher in Japan would be nice as well, and that would require linguistics studies... The worst thing is, both degrees have one of the lowest starting salary among all the degrees, am now hesitating on whether to appeal to NBS instead... :/ cGPA: ard 3.82 O level: L1R5=4, L1R4=6,11.431487001562758

I'm currently year one bba student. so many bell curve wreckers and the modules are so quantitative in nature. I remember last sem the mean and median for FA was 26 and 28. almost everybody got close to full marks and the exam was madness. And what's with the BIZ anal flip class room thing. really makes me feel like flipping table instead. lol but nus biz is copying smu in some ways. even our profs are comparing. NUS biz is surely harder to score. NBS average bellcurve lies at around B+ while NUS biz lies around B. Not to mention the accountancy cohort of NUS is 3 times smaller than NBS with people of much higher GPA/ Rank point going in.averagewee wrote:  eh not sure leh. for my sectional group we all like competitive in class but outside class like alright leh. So far nobody has ever throw my notes away leh. But i heard stories from senior that there are people who don't even teach their friends as they think it's damn stupid to help them due to the bellcurve. Personal feeling, people who refuses to teach generally do not score very well hence they feel insecure. For any of the peeps here, whatever course you go to, ignore the bell curve and teach. Nothing aid learning better than teaching your peers.averagewee wrote:  so far i haven't memorize anything for biz leh. Mostly got cheatsheet and biz cannot really memorize la. need quite a lot of critical thinking in some way. Biz in uni is quite different from poly in some way. Agreed, it works for NBS too. Not much memorization need with so many mod having open book and cheatsheet. Mods that i memorised generally only score a B+ or so because i fail to understand the concepts. Mod that i score A/ A+ hardly require much memorising since I get the concepts. Main point is that in Uni learn to understand and not memorise, non of the dean listers I see uses pure memory. People who say that mugging can give you your first class honors totally discount the understanding part.,11.335923412114672

Also, I feel you about not being able to get into a local university of my choice! I screwed up my admission to get into my several dream courses at various Local U's during the first year because I thought they only look at GPA, and hence I didn't really bother much with the interview/and did not fill my non-CCA achievements. I thought I would definitely secure a place butI was so FRIGGIN WRONG. I felt like I was going to die literally because I couldn't get into a Local U. It was awful because I worked so friggin hard in poly D': Fortunately, I managed to pull myself together and manage to not screw up the second time and got into a local U with a course of my choice  So, DONT GIVE UP BRO. Now that you are closer to ORD, find some time to improve yourself, hunt down your poly lecturer to write you that testimonial letter for your university admission as they will really help. You are a merit holder, I am sure you have worked hard for it and paid attention during leessons. Your lecturers 会给你面子 if you are sincere and ask nicely!   If all else fails, there is always a local university route outside of NTU/NUS and it can be even better than the two.. but I can't say here.. later people will think I am biased towards certain university...

Personal feeling, people who refuses to teach generally do not score very well hence they feel insecure. For any of the peeps here, whatever course you go to, ignore the bell curve and teach.

Not much memorization need with so many mod having open book and cheatsheet. Mods that i memorised generally only score a B+ or so because i fail to understand the concepts. Mod that i score A/ A+ hardly require much memorising since I get the concepts. Main point is that in Uni learn to understand and not memorise, non of the dean listers I see uses pure memory.

Congrats on being shortlisted for SMU SIS interview! First and foremost, you can find numerous blogs and forums with information about the interview. That aside, I've just went for the interview on 9th April and have just received an acceptance email today. So I will be actually telling you what to expect for the interview but it may differ. Firstly, it is a group interview which  consists of 2 interviewers (professors) and 6 interviewees including you. Upon arrival, you will be led to a room by current SIS student volunteers where they will brief you through the interview progress. You will then be given 15 minutes to complete a form whereby you have to state specific examples of certain characteristics and traits (eg. Leadership, curiosity etc). On the same form you have to list down 3 questions you wanna ask the professors. Another 15 minutes will be given to you to design (sketch on a black paper) a Web page depending on the case study. Once completed, you will be led to another room where the interviewers will already be seated. One by one, you have to present your design to everybody. Do expect some questions to be asked by the professors pertaining to your design.  Next comes the famous SMU estimation question and you have 4 minutes to write down your answer on a piece of paper. The question I received was, "How many A4 sized papers are used for exam questions in SMU per semester." They do not care about your final answer but are more concern on your thought process. So make realistic and sound assumptions before arriving to your final answer. The professors may ask the origin of your assumption. So make sure you know how to explain. Lastly, the interview will end of with a Q&A session whereby questions you have listed on earlier will be answered. Do not list down questions which can be easily found on SMU's website.  Be confident and show your passion towards IS while presenting your ideas. SMU SIS looks for students who are able to analyse problems fast with critical thinking skills. As long as you make an effort to prepare for the interview, you have won half of the battle. With that,  I wish you all the best for the interview Hi, went for the same interview on 18th of March(think maybe first batch), but until now still no news lol? does it mean I will be rejected bro??,11.050392593315397

Also, back then, I barely had a year's worth of working experience, so when the interviewers bombarded me with questions, they basically stepped all over me ...

I felt that if I was granted a chance to present myself, I would definitely be much better than in 2011, so I decided to give it another shot this year. Also haha, because zeh zeh old liao, need to go back to school, if not it's now or never. True enough, this year, I got called for two interviews, but I don't know the application results yet. Could answer the interview questions better with more matured viewpoints, but of course, was also thrown a few curveball questions such as, "Why do you intend to go back to school since you've already entered the workforce?" Hopefully I explained myself well enough to the interviewers, so can only hope for the best now.  Hahaha sorry for this terribly long post, but for all the poly kids who got rejected ... may my story remind you that it's definitely not the end, so don't give up ... You still have a few years to try for a place in local uni. In the meantime, you can always find a job like I did and work for a few years first. I have found that it can be equally, if not more, rewarding. Anyone remembers this zehzeh?  I GOT MY OFFER FOR NTU SOCIOLOGY today! This is the same exact course I had indicated as my first choice back in 2011 ...  My same message stays: Don't give up if you don't get in now, there is a time and place for everything ... ,11.04738942363166

I took amaths and economics during my secondary and poly time respectively. I also applied for nus fass for the previous 2 years, but they rejected me too which i dunno why.  Could it be the reason that i am serving ns now? I kinda at a loss about what to do. I dont really wanna go SIM with my gpa! No! In fact, NS should be an advantage especially if you get into command school! (That is also considered a non-accademic achievement) Other awards like best soldier may help too! NS is the best time to talk about your experiences and what made you decide (forgive me if I sound too drama or cliche) on going into that dream course! NTU/NUS/SMU requires students to write more about themselves for the courses they require to get into/why and there is a portion for non-accademic achievements. Remember to fill that up! Don't think it is not important because there are many people with the same GPA as you, so how do they consider applicants? To see if they have any additional talents/achievements they can bring with them outside their GPA!!! I cannot stress this enough, especially if you are from a poly! Also, I feel you about not being able to get into a local university of my choice! I screwed up my admission to get into my several dream courses at various Local U's during the first year because I thought they only look at GPA, and hence I didn't really bother much with the interview/and did not fill my non-CCA achievements. I thought I would definitely secure a place butI was so FRIGGIN WRONG. I felt like I was going to die literally because I couldn't get into a Local U. It was awful because I worked so friggin hard in poly D': Fortunately, I managed to pull myself together and manage to not screw up the second time and got into a local U with a course of my choice  So, DONT GIVE UP BRO. Now that you are closer to ORD, find some time to improve yourself, hunt down your poly lecturer to write you that testimonial letter for your university admission as they will really help. You are a merit holder, I am sure you have worked hard for it and paid attention during leessons. Your lecturers 会给你面子 if you are sincere and ask nicely!   If all else fails, there is always a local university route outside of NTU/NUS and it can be even better than the two.. but I can't say here.. later people will think I am biased towards certain university...

Not sure if you are really from NBS. People study yes, mug day and night no. Average AUs per sem is around 17, can't see why you complaining. Each mod at most have 1 week of Elearning. I took blaw before and I don't remember any streaming video whatsoever. Recorded lecture is made available only to aid students who miss / have doubt after the lectures. NUS cannot choose their specialisation as what they wish, CAP is still a consideration. So far the only subject I have trouble understanding the lecturer is stats, most prof are Singaporean and speak rather well. Also, I survive 80% of my modules without the textbooks, notes are generally sufficient. Lastly, I have more NUS friends regretting not coming NBS instead. I can say with certainty NUS acc is way more competitive.,11.886094740535897

I think you shouldn't get too caught up with reputation right now, it is something that shouldn't take precedence over your interests and your desired career - mainly because it isn't as important as you think it is. I've a senior, an IP student from one of the top JCs who scored straight B's for his A levels did not get called for an interview for his 1st nor 2nd choice at SMU. Fella decided to go to SIM to pursue his studies in a similar field and is earning quite a lot working as a trader for a fund now.  There are a lot of ways you can monetize your degree - as long as you are doing what you want to do you will think of ways to do so. If you're going to do Jap studies but you're interested in Finance, then do take some finance mods if that is possible, join a finance CCA, take up CFA, participate in competitions, write a paper on Japan and show your employer that you are well versed with Jap culture and at the same time highly passionate (and active) in the finance side of things - you will be an amazing hire for a company looking to expand into / their operations in Japan.  It is important for us not to get caught up with the rankings. I cannot stress this enough - at the end of the day, it is who you are, what you've done and how you're working towards your goals that matter, not the reputation of your University.  Just to share: the decision for me was simple back then - I've sorted out my interests, understood what I needed to do... so I picked the one that's closest to where I live  And my parents are both members of KRGH so that made the choice even more obvious! Thanks for the great advice!  I am offered to do Linguistics in NTU, and it's a more attractive offer now especially since I am offered a scholarship there. The truth is, I love languages, and I'm obsessed with Japanese as well. Been learning the language since P5, over 9 years liao. Been exposed to the culture since I was born, so I am very influenced and in love with it. But still, I don't really see the point in doing Japanese Studies.  I am a Tourism/Business student in NP, so I have both business and hospitality backgrounds to fall upon. I am thinking of being a translator/interpreter, but doing Jap Studies would be pointless since I can't just concentrate on just one language. Being an Eng teacher in Japan would be nice as well, and that would require linguistics studies... The worst thing is, both degrees have one of the lowest starting salary among all the degrees, am now hesitating on whether to appeal to NBS instead... :/ cGPA: ard 3.82 O level: L1R5=4, L1R4=6,11.452849134531945

The question I received was, "How many A4 sized papers are used for exam questions in SMU per semester." They do not care about your final answer but are more concern on your thought process. So make realistic and sound assumptions before arriving to your final answer. The professors may ask the origin of your assumption. So make sure you know how to explain. Lastly, the interview will end of with a Q&A session whereby questions you have listed on earlier will be answered. Do not list down questions which can be easily found on SMU's website.

I took amaths and economics during my secondary and poly time respectively. I also applied for nus fass for the previous 2 years, but they rejected me too which i dunno why.  Could it be the reason that i am serving ns now? I kinda at a loss about what to do. I dont really wanna go SIM with my gpa! No! In fact, NS should be an advantage especially if you get into command school! (That is also considered a non-accademic achievement) Other awards like best soldier may help too! NS is the best time to talk about your experiences and what made you decide (forgive me if I sound too drama or cliche) on going into that dream course! NTU/NUS/SMU requires students to write more about themselves for the courses they require to get into/why and there is a portion for non-accademic achievements. Remember to fill that up! Don't think it is not important because there are many people with the same GPA as you, so how do they consider applicants? To see if they have any additional talents/achievements they can bring with them outside their GPA!!! I cannot stress this enough, especially if you are from a poly! Also, I feel you about not being able to get into a local university of my choice! I screwed up my admission to get into my several dream courses at various Local U's during the first year because I thought they only look at GPA, and hence I didn't really bother much with the interview/and did not fill my non-CCA achievements. I thought I would definitely secure a place butI was so FRIGGIN WRONG. I felt like I was going to die literally because I couldn't get into a Local U. It was awful because I worked so friggin hard in poly D': Fortunately, I managed to pull myself together and manage to not screw up the second time and got into a local U with a course of my choice  So, DONT GIVE UP BRO. Now that you are closer to ORD, find some time to improve yourself, hunt down your poly lecturer to write you that testimonial letter for your university admission as they will really help. You are a merit holder, I am sure you have worked hard for it and paid attention during leessons. Your lecturers 会给你面子 if you are sincere and ask nicely!   If all else fails, there is always a local university route outside of NTU/NUS and it can be even better than the two.. but I can't say here.. later people will think I am biased towards certain university...

Not sure if you are really from NBS. People study yes, mug day and night no. Average AUs per sem is around 17, can't see why you complaining. Each mod at most have 1 week of Elearning. I took blaw before and I don't remember any streaming video whatsoever. Recorded lecture is made available only to aid students who miss / have doubt after the lectures. NUS cannot choose their specialisation as what they wish, CAP is still a consideration. So far the only subject I have trouble understanding the lecturer is stats, most prof are Singaporean and speak rather well. Also, I survive 80% of my modules without the textbooks, notes are generally sufficient. Lastly, I have more NUS friends regretting not coming NBS instead. I can say with certainty NUS acc is way more competitive.,11.886094740535897

I think you shouldn't get too caught up with reputation right now, it is something that shouldn't take precedence over your interests and your desired career - mainly because it isn't as important as you think it is. I've a senior, an IP student from one of the top JCs who scored straight B's for his A levels did not get called for an interview for his 1st nor 2nd choice at SMU. Fella decided to go to SIM to pursue his studies in a similar field and is earning quite a lot working as a trader for a fund now.  There are a lot of ways you can monetize your degree - as long as you are doing what you want to do you will think of ways to do so. If you're going to do Jap studies but you're interested in Finance, then do take some finance mods if that is possible, join a finance CCA, take up CFA, participate in competitions, write a paper on Japan and show your employer that you are well versed with Jap culture and at the same time highly passionate (and active) in the finance side of things - you will be an amazing hire for a company looking to expand into / their operations in Japan.  It is important for us not to get caught up with the rankings. I cannot stress this enough - at the end of the day, it is who you are, what you've done and how you're working towards your goals that matter, not the reputation of your University.  Just to share: the decision for me was simple back then - I've sorted out my interests, understood what I needed to do... so I picked the one that's closest to where I live  And my parents are both members of KRGH so that made the choice even more obvious! Thanks for the great advice!  I am offered to do Linguistics in NTU, and it's a more attractive offer now especially since I am offered a scholarship there. The truth is, I love languages, and I'm obsessed with Japanese as well. Been learning the language since P5, over 9 years liao. Been exposed to the culture since I was born, so I am very influenced and in love with it. But still, I don't really see the point in doing Japanese Studies.  I am a Tourism/Business student in NP, so I have both business and hospitality backgrounds to fall upon. I am thinking of being a translator/interpreter, but doing Jap Studies would be pointless since I can't just concentrate on just one language. Being an Eng teacher in Japan would be nice as well, and that would require linguistics studies... The worst thing is, both degrees have one of the lowest starting salary among all the degrees, am now hesitating on whether to appeal to NBS instead... :/ cGPA: ard 3.82 O level: L1R5=4, L1R4=6,11.452849134531945

And what's with the BIZ anal flip class room thing. really makes me feel like flipping table instead. lol but nus biz is copying smu in some ways. even our profs are comparing. NUS biz is surely harder to score. NBS average bellcurve lies at around B+ while NUS biz lies around B.

But i heard stories from senior that there are people who don't even teach their friends as they think it's damn stupid to help them due to the bellcurve. Personal feeling, people who refuses to teach generally do not score very well hence they feel insecure. For any of the peeps here, whatever course you go to, ignore the bell curve and teach. Nothing aid learning better than teaching your peers.averagewee wrote:  so far i haven't memorize anything for biz leh. Mostly got cheatsheet and biz cannot really memorize la. need quite a lot of critical thinking in some way. Biz in uni is quite different from poly in some way. Agreed, it works for NBS too. Not much memorization need with so many mod having open book and cheatsheet. Mods that i memorised generally only score a B+ or so because i fail to understand the concepts. Mod that i score A/ A+ hardly require much memorising since I get the concepts. Main point is that in Uni learn to understand and not memorise, non of the dean listers I see uses pure memory. People who say that mugging can give you your first class honors totally discount the understanding part.,11.337860121091227

But i heard stories from senior that there are people who don't even teach their friends as they think it's damn stupid to help them due to the bellcurve. Personal feeling, people who refuses to teach generally do not score very well hence they feel insecure. For any of the peeps here, whatever course you go to, ignore the bell curve and teach. Nothing aid learning better than teaching your peers.averagewee wrote:  so far i haven't memorize anything for biz leh. Mostly got cheatsheet and biz cannot really memorize la. need quite a lot of critical thinking in some way. Biz in uni is quite different from poly in some way. Agreed, it works for NBS too. Not much memorization need with so many mod having open book and cheatsheet. Mods that i memorised generally only score a B+ or so because i fail to understand the concepts. Mod that i score A/ A+ hardly require much memorising since I get the concepts. Main point is that in Uni learn to understand and not memorise, non of the dean listers I see uses pure memory. People who say that mugging can give you your first class honors totally discount the understanding part.,11.337860121091227

Could answer the interview questions better with more matured viewpoints, but of course, was also thrown a few curveball questions such as, "Why do you intend to go back to school since you've already entered the workforce?" Hopefully I explained myself well enough to the interviewers, so can only hope for the best now.  Hahaha sorry for this terribly long post, but for all the poly kids who got rejected ... may my story remind you that it's definitely not the end, so don't give up ... You still have a few years to try for a place in local uni. In the meantime, you can always find a job like I did and work for a few years first. I have found that it can be equally, if not more, rewarding. Anyone remembers this zehzeh?  I GOT MY OFFER FOR NTU SOCIOLOGY today!

First and foremost, you can find numerous blogs and forums with information about the interview. That aside, I've just went for the interview on 9th April and have just received an acceptance email today. So I will be actually telling you what to expect for the interview but it may differ. Firstly, it is a group interview which  consists of 2 interviewers (professors) and 6 interviewees including you. Upon arrival, you will be led to a room by current SIS student volunteers where they will brief you through the interview progress. You will then be given 15 minutes to complete a form whereby you have to state specific examples of certain characteristics and traits (eg. Leadership, curiosity etc). On the same form you have to list down 3 questions you wanna ask the professors. Another 15 minutes will be given to you to design (sketch on a black paper) a Web page depending on the case study. Once completed, you will be led to another room where the interviewers will already be seated. One by one, you have to present your design to everybody. Do expect some questions to be asked by the professors pertaining to your design.  Next comes the famous SMU estimation question and you have 4 minutes to write down your answer on a piece of paper. The question I received was, "How many A4 sized papers are used for exam questions in SMU per semester." They do not care about your final answer but are more concern on your thought process. So make realistic and sound assumptions before arriving to your final answer. The professors may ask the origin of your assumption. So make sure you know how to explain. Lastly, the interview will end of with a Q&A session whereby questions you have listed on earlier will be answered. Do not list down questions which can be easily found on SMU's website.  Be confident and show your passion towards IS while presenting your ideas. SMU SIS looks for students who are able to analyse problems fast with critical thinking skills. As long as you make an effort to prepare for the interview, you have won half of the battle.

You will then be given 15 minutes to complete a form whereby you have to state specific examples of certain characteristics and traits (eg. Leadership, curiosity etc).

Once completed, you will be led to another room where the interviewers will already be seated. One by one, you have to present your design to everybody. Do expect some questions to be asked by the professors pertaining to your design.  Next comes the famous SMU estimation question and you have 4 minutes to write down your answer on a piece of paper. The question I received was, "How many A4 sized papers are used for exam questions in SMU per semester." They do not care about your final answer but are more concern on your thought process. So make realistic and sound assumptions before arriving to your final answer. The professors may ask the origin of your assumption. So make sure you know how to explain.

I took amaths and economics during my secondary and poly time respectively. I also applied for nus fass for the previous 2 years, but they rejected me too which i dunno why.  Could it be the reason that i am serving ns now? I kinda at a loss about what to do. I dont really wanna go SIM with my gpa! No! In fact, NS should be an advantage especially if you get into command school! (That is also considered a non-accademic achievement) Other awards like best soldier may help too! NS is the best time to talk about your experiences and what made you decide (forgive me if I sound too drama or cliche) on going into that dream course! NTU/NUS/SMU requires students to write more about themselves for the courses they require to get into/why and there is a portion for non-accademic achievements. Remember to fill that up! Don't think it is not important because there are many people with the same GPA as you, so how do they consider applicants? To see if they have any additional talents/achievements they can bring with them outside their GPA!!! I cannot stress this enough, especially if you are from a poly! Also, I feel you about not being able to get into a local university of my choice! I screwed up my admission to get into my several dream courses at various Local U's during the first year because I thought they only look at GPA, and hence I didn't really bother much with the interview/and did not fill my non-CCA achievements. I thought I would definitely secure a place butI was so FRIGGIN WRONG. I felt like I was going to die literally because I couldn't get into a Local U. It was awful because I worked so friggin hard in poly D': Fortunately, I managed to pull myself together and manage to not screw up the second time and got into a local U with a course of my choice  So, DONT GIVE UP BRO. Now that you are closer to ORD, find some time to improve yourself, hunt down your poly lecturer to write you that testimonial letter for your university admission as they will really help. You are a merit holder, I am sure you have worked hard for it and paid attention during leessons. Your lecturers 会给你面子 if you are sincere and ask nicely!   If all else fails, there is always a local university route outside of NTU/NUS and it can be even better than the two.. but I can't say here.. later people will think I am biased towards certain university...

Not sure if you are really from NBS. People study yes, mug day and night no. Average AUs per sem is around 17, can't see why you complaining. Each mod at most have 1 week of Elearning. I took blaw before and I don't remember any streaming video whatsoever. Recorded lecture is made available only to aid students who miss / have doubt after the lectures. NUS cannot choose their specialisation as what they wish, CAP is still a consideration. So far the only subject I have trouble understanding the lecturer is stats, most prof are Singaporean and speak rather well. Also, I survive 80% of my modules without the textbooks, notes are generally sufficient. Lastly, I have more NUS friends regretting not coming NBS instead. I can say with certainty NUS acc is way more competitive.,11.886094740535897

I think you shouldn't get too caught up with reputation right now, it is something that shouldn't take precedence over your interests and your desired career - mainly because it isn't as important as you think it is. I've a senior, an IP student from one of the top JCs who scored straight B's for his A levels did not get called for an interview for his 1st nor 2nd choice at SMU. Fella decided to go to SIM to pursue his studies in a similar field and is earning quite a lot working as a trader for a fund now.  There are a lot of ways you can monetize your degree - as long as you are doing what you want to do you will think of ways to do so. If you're going to do Jap studies but you're interested in Finance, then do take some finance mods if that is possible, join a finance CCA, take up CFA, participate in competitions, write a paper on Japan and show your employer that you are well versed with Jap culture and at the same time highly passionate (and active) in the finance side of things - you will be an amazing hire for a company looking to expand into / their operations in Japan.  It is important for us not to get caught up with the rankings. I cannot stress this enough - at the end of the day, it is who you are, what you've done and how you're working towards your goals that matter, not the reputation of your University.  Just to share: the decision for me was simple back then - I've sorted out my interests, understood what I needed to do... so I picked the one that's closest to where I live  And my parents are both members of KRGH so that made the choice even more obvious! Thanks for the great advice!  I am offered to do Linguistics in NTU, and it's a more attractive offer now especially since I am offered a scholarship there. The truth is, I love languages, and I'm obsessed with Japanese as well. Been learning the language since P5, over 9 years liao. Been exposed to the culture since I was born, so I am very influenced and in love with it. But still, I don't really see the point in doing Japanese Studies.  I am a Tourism/Business student in NP, so I have both business and hospitality backgrounds to fall upon. I am thinking of being a translator/interpreter, but doing Jap Studies would be pointless since I can't just concentrate on just one language. Being an Eng teacher in Japan would be nice as well, and that would require linguistics studies... The worst thing is, both degrees have one of the lowest starting salary among all the degrees, am now hesitating on whether to appeal to NBS instead... :/ cGPA: ard 3.82 O level: L1R5=4, L1R4=6,11.452849134531945

Congrats on being shortlisted for SMU SIS interview! First and foremost, you can find numerous blogs and forums with information about the interview. That aside, I've just went for the interview on 9th April and have just received an acceptance email today. So I will be actually telling you what to expect for the interview but it may differ. Firstly, it is a group interview which  consists of 2 interviewers (professors) and 6 interviewees including you. Upon arrival, you will be led to a room by current SIS student volunteers where they will brief you through the interview progress. You will then be given 15 minutes to complete a form whereby you have to state specific examples of certain characteristics and traits (eg. Leadership, curiosity etc). On the same form you have to list down 3 questions you wanna ask the professors. Another 15 minutes will be given to you to design (sketch on a black paper) a Web page depending on the case study. Once completed, you will be led to another room where the interviewers will already be seated. One by one, you have to present your design to everybody. Do expect some questions to be asked by the professors pertaining to your design.  Next comes the famous SMU estimation question and you have 4 minutes to write down your answer on a piece of paper. The question I received was, "How many A4 sized papers are used for exam questions in SMU per semester." They do not care about your final answer but are more concern on your thought process. So make realistic and sound assumptions before arriving to your final answer. The professors may ask the origin of your assumption. So make sure you know how to explain.

NS is the best time to talk about your experiences and what made you decide (forgive me if I sound too drama or cliche) on going into that dream course! NTU/NUS/SMU requires students to write more about themselves for the courses they require to get into/why and there is a portion for non-accademic achievements. Remember to fill that up! Don't think it is not important because there are many people with the same GPA as you, so how do they consider applicants? To see if they have any additional talents/achievements they can bring with them outside their GPA!!! I cannot stress this enough, especially if you are from a poly! Also, I feel you about not being able to get into a local university of my choice! I screwed up my admission to get into my several dream courses at various Local U's during the first year because I thought they only look at GPA, and hence I didn't really bother much with the interview/and did not fill my non-CCA achievements. I thought I would definitely secure a place butI was so FRIGGIN WRONG. I felt like I was going to die literally because I couldn't get into a Local U. It was awful because I worked so friggin hard in poly D': Fortunately, I managed to pull myself together and manage to not screw up the second time and got into a local U with a course of my choice  So, DONT GIVE UP BRO. Now that you are closer to ORD, find some time to improve yourself, hunt down your poly lecturer to write you that testimonial letter for your university admission as they will really help. You are a merit holder, I am sure you have worked hard for it and paid attention during leessons. Your lecturers 会给你面子 if you are sincere and ask nicely!   If all else fails, there is always a local university route outside of NTU/NUS and it can be even better than the two.. but I can't say here.. later people will think I am biased towards certain university...

Give u an example biz law taught here is through streaming video and learn urself one through recorded videos and this happens throughout the whole module.

U ask them something that u are not sure, they will talk one big round and call u go read textbook when u dont understand what they talking. pay sch fee gam lan like that (before u tell me uni is self learning, or what sh1t u just go and google in youtube and see how the lecturers teach first okay) business sch all is like memorising liao, everything just vomit out. where got application in real world? those who got $$ i rather u go overseas la seriously. anyway just take this with a pinch of salt NBS yr2/acc here. Not sure if you are really from NBS. People study yes, mug day and night no. Average AUs per sem is around 17, can't see why you complaining. Each mod at most have 1 week of Elearning. I took blaw before and I don't remember any streaming video whatsoever. Recorded lecture is made available only to aid students who miss / have doubt after the lectures. NUS cannot choose their specialisation as what they wish, CAP is still a consideration. So far the only subject I have trouble understanding the lecturer is stats, most prof are Singaporean and speak rather well. Also, I survive 80% of my modules without the textbooks, notes are generally sufficient. Lastly, I have more NUS friends regretting not coming NBS instead. I can say with certainty NUS acc is way more competitive.,11.886094740535897

I think you shouldn't get too caught up with reputation right now, it is something that shouldn't take precedence over your interests and your desired career - mainly because it isn't as important as you think it is. I've a senior, an IP student from one of the top JCs who scored straight B's for his A levels did not get called for an interview for his 1st nor 2nd choice at SMU. Fella decided to go to SIM to pursue his studies in a similar field and is earning quite a lot working as a trader for a fund now.  There are a lot of ways you can monetize your degree - as long as you are doing what you want to do you will think of ways to do so. If you're going to do Jap studies but you're interested in Finance, then do take some finance mods if that is possible, join a finance CCA, take up CFA, participate in competitions, write a paper on Japan and show your employer that you are well versed with Jap culture and at the same time highly passionate (and active) in the finance side of things - you will be an amazing hire for a company looking to expand into / their operations in Japan.  It is important for us not to get caught up with the rankings. I cannot stress this enough - at the end of the day, it is who you are, what you've done and how you're working towards your goals that matter, not the reputation of your University.  Just to share: the decision for me was simple back then - I've sorted out my interests, understood what I needed to do... so I picked the one that's closest to where I live  And my parents are both members of KRGH so that made the choice even more obvious! Thanks for the great advice!  I am offered to do Linguistics in NTU, and it's a more attractive offer now especially since I am offered a scholarship there. The truth is, I love languages, and I'm obsessed with Japanese as well. Been learning the language since P5, over 9 years liao. Been exposed to the culture since I was born, so I am very influenced and in love with it. But still, I don't really see the point in doing Japanese Studies.  I am a Tourism/Business student in NP, so I have both business and hospitality backgrounds to fall upon. I am thinking of being a translator/interpreter, but doing Jap Studies would be pointless since I can't just concentrate on just one language. Being an Eng teacher in Japan would be nice as well, and that would require linguistics studies... The worst thing is, both degrees have one of the lowest starting salary among all the degrees, am now hesitating on whether to appeal to NBS instead... :/ cGPA: ard 3.82 O level: L1R5=4, L1R4=6,11.452849134531945

I'm currently year one bba student. so many bell curve wreckers and the modules are so quantitative in nature. I remember last sem the mean and median for FA was 26 and 28. almost everybody got close to full marks and the exam was madness. And what's with the BIZ anal flip class room thing. really makes me feel like flipping table instead. lol but nus biz is copying smu in some ways. even our profs are comparing. NUS biz is surely harder to score. NBS average bellcurve lies at around B+ while NUS biz lies around B. Not to mention the accountancy cohort of NUS is 3 times smaller than NBS with people of much higher GPA/ Rank point going in.averagewee wrote:  eh not sure leh. for my sectional group we all like competitive in class but outside class like alright leh. So far nobody has ever throw my notes away leh. But i heard stories from senior that there are people who don't even teach their friends as they think it's damn stupid to help them due to the bellcurve. Personal feeling, people who refuses to teach generally do not score very well hence they feel insecure. For any of the peeps here, whatever course you go to, ignore the bell curve and teach. Nothing aid learning better than teaching your peers.averagewee wrote:  so far i haven't memorize anything for biz leh. Mostly got cheatsheet and biz cannot really memorize la. need quite a lot of critical thinking in some way. Biz in uni is quite different from poly in some way. Agreed, it works for NBS too. Not much memorization need with so many mod having open book and cheatsheet. Mods that i memorised generally only score a B+ or so because i fail to understand the concepts. Mod that i score A/ A+ hardly require much memorising since I get the concepts. Main point is that in Uni learn to understand and not memorise, non of the dean listers I see uses pure memory. People who say that mugging can give you your first class honors totally discount the understanding part.,11.337860121091227

NUS biz is surely harder to score. NBS average bellcurve lies at around B+ while NUS biz lies around B.

But i heard stories from senior that there are people who don't even teach their friends as they think it's damn stupid to help them due to the bellcurve. Personal feeling, people who refuses to teach generally do not score very well hence they feel insecure. For any of the peeps here, whatever course you go to, ignore the bell curve and teach. Nothing aid learning better than teaching your peers.averagewee wrote:  so far i haven't memorize anything for biz leh. Mostly got cheatsheet and biz cannot really memorize la. need quite a lot of critical thinking in some way. Biz in uni is quite different from poly in some way. Agreed, it works for NBS too. Not much memorization need with so many mod having open book and cheatsheet. Mods that i memorised generally only score a B+ or so because i fail to understand the concepts. Mod that i score A/ A+ hardly require much memorising since I get the concepts. Main point is that in Uni learn to understand and not memorise, non of the dean listers I see uses pure memory.

Congrats on being shortlisted for SMU SIS interview! First and foremost, you can find numerous blogs and forums with information about the interview. That aside, I've just went for the interview on 9th April and have just received an acceptance email today. So I will be actually telling you what to expect for the interview but it may differ. Firstly, it is a group interview which  consists of 2 interviewers (professors) and 6 interviewees including you. Upon arrival, you will be led to a room by current SIS student volunteers where they will brief you through the interview progress. You will then be given 15 minutes to complete a form whereby you have to state specific examples of certain characteristics and traits (eg. Leadership, curiosity etc). On the same form you have to list down 3 questions you wanna ask the professors. Another 15 minutes will be given to you to design (sketch on a black paper) a Web page depending on the case study. Once completed, you will be led to another room where the interviewers will already be seated. One by one, you have to present your design to everybody. Do expect some questions to be asked by the professors pertaining to your design.  Next comes the famous SMU estimation question and you have 4 minutes to write down your answer on a piece of paper. The question I received was, "How many A4 sized papers are used for exam questions in SMU per semester." They do not care about your final answer but are more concern on your thought process. So make realistic and sound assumptions before arriving to your final answer. The professors may ask the origin of your assumption. So make sure you know how to explain. Lastly, the interview will end of with a Q&A session whereby questions you have listed on earlier will be answered. Do not list down questions which can be easily found on SMU's website.  Be confident and show your passion towards IS while presenting your ideas. SMU SIS looks for students who are able to analyse problems fast with critical thinking skills. As long as you make an effort to prepare for the interview, you have won half of the battle.

I took amaths and economics during my secondary and poly time respectively. I also applied for nus fass for the previous 2 years, but they rejected me too which i dunno why.  Could it be the reason that i am serving ns now? I kinda at a loss about what to do. I dont really wanna go SIM with my gpa! No! In fact, NS should be an advantage especially if you get into command school! (That is also considered a non-accademic achievement) Other awards like best soldier may help too! NS is the best time to talk about your experiences and what made you decide (forgive me if I sound too drama or cliche) on going into that dream course! NTU/NUS/SMU requires students to write more about themselves for the courses they require to get into/why and there is a portion for non-accademic achievements. Remember to fill that up! Don't think it is not important because there are many people with the same GPA as you, so how do they consider applicants? To see if they have any additional talents/achievements they can bring with them outside their GPA!!! I cannot stress this enough, especially if you are from a poly! Also, I feel you about not being able to get into a local university of my choice! I screwed up my admission to get into my several dream courses at various Local U's during the first year because I thought they only look at GPA, and hence I didn't really bother much with the interview/and did not fill my non-CCA achievements. I thought I would definitely secure a place butI was so FRIGGIN WRONG. I felt like I was going to die literally because I couldn't get into a Local U. It was awful because I worked so friggin hard in poly D': Fortunately, I managed to pull myself together and manage to not screw up the second time and got into a local U with a course of my choice  So, DONT GIVE UP BRO. Now that you are closer to ORD, find some time to improve yourself, hunt down your poly lecturer to write you that testimonial letter for your university admission as they will really help. You are a merit holder, I am sure you have worked hard for it and paid attention during leessons. Your lecturers 会给你面子 if you are sincere and ask nicely!   If all else fails, there is always a local university route outside of NTU/NUS and it can be even better than the two.. but I can't say here.. later people will think I am biased towards certain university...

Not sure if you are really from NBS. People study yes, mug day and night no. Average AUs per sem is around 17, can't see why you complaining. Each mod at most have 1 week of Elearning. I took blaw before and I don't remember any streaming video whatsoever. Recorded lecture is made available only to aid students who miss / have doubt after the lectures. NUS cannot choose their specialisation as what they wish, CAP is still a consideration. So far the only subject I have trouble understanding the lecturer is stats, most prof are Singaporean and speak rather well. Also, I survive 80% of my modules without the textbooks, notes are generally sufficient. Lastly, I have more NUS friends regretting not coming NBS instead. I can say with certainty NUS acc is way more competitive.,11.886094740535897

I think you shouldn't get too caught up with reputation right now, it is something that shouldn't take precedence over your interests and your desired career - mainly because it isn't as important as you think it is. I've a senior, an IP student from one of the top JCs who scored straight B's for his A levels did not get called for an interview for his 1st nor 2nd choice at SMU. Fella decided to go to SIM to pursue his studies in a similar field and is earning quite a lot working as a trader for a fund now.  There are a lot of ways you can monetize your degree - as long as you are doing what you want to do you will think of ways to do so. If you're going to do Jap studies but you're interested in Finance, then do take some finance mods if that is possible, join a finance CCA, take up CFA, participate in competitions, write a paper on Japan and show your employer that you are well versed with Jap culture and at the same time highly passionate (and active) in the finance side of things - you will be an amazing hire for a company looking to expand into / their operations in Japan.  It is important for us not to get caught up with the rankings. I cannot stress this enough - at the end of the day, it is who you are, what you've done and how you're working towards your goals that matter, not the reputation of your University.  Just to share: the decision for me was simple back then - I've sorted out my interests, understood what I needed to do... so I picked the one that's closest to where I live  And my parents are both members of KRGH so that made the choice even more obvious! Thanks for the great advice!  I am offered to do Linguistics in NTU, and it's a more attractive offer now especially since I am offered a scholarship there. The truth is, I love languages, and I'm obsessed with Japanese as well. Been learning the language since P5, over 9 years liao. Been exposed to the culture since I was born, so I am very influenced and in love with it. But still, I don't really see the point in doing Japanese Studies.  I am a Tourism/Business student in NP, so I have both business and hospitality backgrounds to fall upon. I am thinking of being a translator/interpreter, but doing Jap Studies would be pointless since I can't just concentrate on just one language. Being an Eng teacher in Japan would be nice as well, and that would require linguistics studies... The worst thing is, both degrees have one of the lowest starting salary among all the degrees, am now hesitating on whether to appeal to NBS instead... :/ cGPA: ard 3.82 O level: L1R5=4, L1R4=6,11.452849134531945

That aside, I've just went for the interview on 9th April and have just received an acceptance email today. So I will be actually telling you what to expect for the interview but it may differ. Firstly, it is a group interview which  consists of 2 interviewers (professors) and 6 interviewees including you. Upon arrival, you will be led to a room by current SIS student volunteers where they will brief you through the interview progress. You will then be given 15 minutes to complete a form whereby you have to state specific examples of certain characteristics and traits (eg. Leadership, curiosity etc). On the same form you have to list down 3 questions you wanna ask the professors. Another 15 minutes will be given to you to design (sketch on a black paper) a Web page depending on the case study. Once completed, you will be led to another room where the interviewers will already be seated. One by one, you have to present your design to everybody. Do expect some questions to be asked by the professors pertaining to your design.  Next comes the famous SMU estimation question and you have 4 minutes to write down your answer on a piece of paper. The question I received was, "How many A4 sized papers are used for exam questions in SMU per semester." They do not care about your final answer but are more concern on your thought process.

NS is the best time to talk about your experiences and what made you decide (forgive me if I sound too drama or cliche) on going into that dream course! NTU/NUS/SMU requires students to write more about themselves for the courses they require to get into/why and there is a portion for non-accademic achievements. Remember to fill that up! Don't think it is not important because there are many people with the same GPA as you, so how do they consider applicants? To see if they have any additional talents/achievements they can bring with them outside their GPA!!! I cannot stress this enough, especially if you are from a poly! Also, I feel you about not being able to get into a local university of my choice! I screwed up my admission to get into my several dream courses at various Local U's during the first year because I thought they only look at GPA, and hence I didn't really bother much with the interview/and did not fill my non-CCA achievements. I thought I would definitely secure a place butI was so FRIGGIN WRONG. I felt like I was going to die literally because I couldn't get into a Local U. It was awful because I worked so friggin hard in poly D': Fortunately, I managed to pull myself together and manage to not screw up the second time and got into a local U with a course of my choice  So, DONT GIVE UP BRO. Now that you are closer to ORD, find some time to improve yourself, hunt down your poly lecturer to write you that testimonial letter for your university admission as they will really help. You are a merit holder, I am sure you have worked hard for it and paid attention during leessons. Your lecturers 会给你面子 if you are sincere and ask nicely!   If all else fails, there is always a local university route outside of NTU/NUS and it can be even better than the two.. but I can't say here.. later people will think I am biased towards certain university...

Not sure if you are really from NBS. People study yes, mug day and night no. Average AUs per sem is around 17, can't see why you complaining. Each mod at most have 1 week of Elearning. I took blaw before and I don't remember any streaming video whatsoever. Recorded lecture is made available only to aid students who miss / have doubt after the lectures. NUS cannot choose their specialisation as what they wish, CAP is still a consideration. So far the only subject I have trouble understanding the lecturer is stats, most prof are Singaporean and speak rather well. Also, I survive 80% of my modules without the textbooks, notes are generally sufficient. Lastly, I have more NUS friends regretting not coming NBS instead. I can say with certainty NUS acc is way more competitive.,11.886094740535897

I think you shouldn't get too caught up with reputation right now, it is something that shouldn't take precedence over your interests and your desired career - mainly because it isn't as important as you think it is. I've a senior, an IP student from one of the top JCs who scored straight B's for his A levels did not get called for an interview for his 1st nor 2nd choice at SMU. Fella decided to go to SIM to pursue his studies in a similar field and is earning quite a lot working as a trader for a fund now.  There are a lot of ways you can monetize your degree - as long as you are doing what you want to do you will think of ways to do so. If you're going to do Jap studies but you're interested in Finance, then do take some finance mods if that is possible, join a finance CCA, take up CFA, participate in competitions, write a paper on Japan and show your employer that you are well versed with Jap culture and at the same time highly passionate (and active) in the finance side of things - you will be an amazing hire for a company looking to expand into / their operations in Japan.  It is important for us not to get caught up with the rankings. I cannot stress this enough - at the end of the day, it is who you are, what you've done and how you're working towards your goals that matter, not the reputation of your University.  Just to share: the decision for me was simple back then - I've sorted out my interests, understood what I needed to do... so I picked the one that's closest to where I live  And my parents are both members of KRGH so that made the choice even more obvious! Thanks for the great advice!  I am offered to do Linguistics in NTU, and it's a more attractive offer now especially since I am offered a scholarship there. The truth is, I love languages, and I'm obsessed with Japanese as well. Been learning the language since P5, over 9 years liao. Been exposed to the culture since I was born, so I am very influenced and in love with it. But still, I don't really see the point in doing Japanese Studies.  I am a Tourism/Business student in NP, so I have both business and hospitality backgrounds to fall upon. I am thinking of being a translator/interpreter, but doing Jap Studies would be pointless since I can't just concentrate on just one language. Being an Eng teacher in Japan would be nice as well, and that would require linguistics studies... The worst thing is, both degrees have one of the lowest starting salary among all the degrees, am now hesitating on whether to appeal to NBS instead... :/ cGPA: ard 3.82 O level: L1R5=4, L1R4=6,11.452849134531945

I'm currently year one bba student. so many bell curve wreckers and the modules are so quantitative in nature. I remember last sem the mean and median for FA was 26 and 28. almost everybody got close to full marks and the exam was madness. And what's with the BIZ anal flip class room thing. really makes me feel like flipping table instead. lol but nus biz is copying smu in some ways. even our profs are comparing. NUS biz is surely harder to score. NBS average bellcurve lies at around B+ while NUS biz lies around B.

So far nobody has ever throw my notes away leh. But i heard stories from senior that there are people who don't even teach their friends as they think it's damn stupid to help them due to the bellcurve. Personal feeling, people who refuses to teach generally do not score very well hence they feel insecure. For any of the peeps here, whatever course you go to, ignore the bell curve and teach. Nothing aid learning better than teaching your peers.averagewee wrote:  so far i haven't memorize anything for biz leh. Mostly got cheatsheet and biz cannot really memorize la. need quite a lot of critical thinking in some way. Biz in uni is quite different from poly in some way. Agreed, it works for NBS too. Not much memorization need with so many mod having open book and cheatsheet. Mods that i memorised generally only score a B+ or so because i fail to understand the concepts. Mod that i score A/ A+ hardly require much memorising since I get the concepts. Main point is that in Uni learn to understand and not memorise, non of the dean listers I see uses pure memory. People who say that mugging can give you your first class honors totally discount the understanding part.,11.337860121091227

Also, I feel you about not being able to get into a local university of my choice! I screwed up my admission to get into my several dream courses at various Local U's during the first year because I thought they only look at GPA, and hence I didn't really bother much with the interview/and did not fill my non-CCA achievements. I thought I would definitely secure a place butI was so FRIGGIN WRONG. I felt like I was going to die literally because I couldn't get into a Local U. It was awful because I worked so friggin hard in poly D': Fortunately, I managed to pull myself together and manage to not screw up the second time and got into a local U with a course of my choice  So, DONT GIVE UP BRO. Now that you are closer to ORD, find some time to improve yourself, hunt down your poly lecturer to write you that testimonial letter for your university admission as they will really help. You are a merit holder, I am sure you have worked hard for it and paid attention during leessons. Your lecturers 会给你面子 if you are sincere and ask nicely!   If all else fails, there is always a local university route outside of NTU/NUS and it can be even better than the two.. but I can't say here.. later people will think I am biased towards certain university...

Nothing aid learning better than teaching your peers.averagewee wrote:  so far i haven't memorize anything for biz leh.

Not much memorization need with so many mod having open book and cheatsheet. Mods that i memorised generally only score a B+ or so because i fail to understand the concepts. Mod that i score A/ A+ hardly require much memorising since I get the concepts. Main point is that in Uni learn to understand and not memorise, non of the dean listers I see uses pure memory.

Congrats on being shortlisted for SMU SIS interview! First and foremost, you can find numerous blogs and forums with information about the interview. That aside, I've just went for the interview on 9th April and have just received an acceptance email today. So I will be actually telling you what to expect for the interview but it may differ. Firstly, it is a group interview which  consists of 2 interviewers (professors) and 6 interviewees including you. Upon arrival, you will be led to a room by current SIS student volunteers where they will brief you through the interview progress. You will then be given 15 minutes to complete a form whereby you have to state specific examples of certain characteristics and traits (eg. Leadership, curiosity etc). On the same form you have to list down 3 questions you wanna ask the professors. Another 15 minutes will be given to you to design (sketch on a black paper) a Web page depending on the case study. Once completed, you will be led to another room where the interviewers will already be seated. One by one, you have to present your design to everybody. Do expect some questions to be asked by the professors pertaining to your design.  Next comes the famous SMU estimation question and you have 4 minutes to write down your answer on a piece of paper. The question I received was, "How many A4 sized papers are used for exam questions in SMU per semester." They do not care about your final answer but are more concern on your thought process. So make realistic and sound assumptions before arriving to your final answer. The professors may ask the origin of your assumption. So make sure you know how to explain. Lastly, the interview will end of with a Q&A session whereby questions you have listed on earlier will be answered. Do not list down questions which can be easily found on SMU's website.  Be confident and show your passion towards IS while presenting your ideas. SMU SIS looks for students who are able to analyse problems fast with critical thinking skills. As long as you make an effort to prepare for the interview, you have won half of the battle.

I took amaths and economics during my secondary and poly time respectively. I also applied for nus fass for the previous 2 years, but they rejected me too which i dunno why.  Could it be the reason that i am serving ns now? I kinda at a loss about what to do. I dont really wanna go SIM with my gpa! No! In fact, NS should be an advantage especially if you get into command school! (That is also considered a non-accademic achievement) Other awards like best soldier may help too! NS is the best time to talk about your experiences and what made you decide (forgive me if I sound too drama or cliche) on going into that dream course! NTU/NUS/SMU requires students to write more about themselves for the courses they require to get into/why and there is a portion for non-accademic achievements. Remember to fill that up! Don't think it is not important because there are many people with the same GPA as you, so how do they consider applicants? To see if they have any additional talents/achievements they can bring with them outside their GPA!!! I cannot stress this enough, especially if you are from a poly! Also, I feel you about not being able to get into a local university of my choice! I screwed up my admission to get into my several dream courses at various Local U's during the first year because I thought they only look at GPA, and hence I didn't really bother much with the interview/and did not fill my non-CCA achievements. I thought I would definitely secure a place butI was so FRIGGIN WRONG. I felt like I was going to die literally because I couldn't get into a Local U. It was awful because I worked so friggin hard in poly D': Fortunately, I managed to pull myself together and manage to not screw up the second time and got into a local U with a course of my choice  So, DONT GIVE UP BRO. Now that you are closer to ORD, find some time to improve yourself, hunt down your poly lecturer to write you that testimonial letter for your university admission as they will really help. You are a merit holder, I am sure you have worked hard for it and paid attention during leessons. Your lecturers 会给你面子 if you are sincere and ask nicely!   If all else fails, there is always a local university route outside of NTU/NUS and it can be even better than the two.. but I can't say here.. later people will think I am biased towards certain university...

I took blaw before and I don't remember any streaming video whatsoever. Recorded lecture is made available only to aid students who miss / have doubt after the lectures. NUS cannot choose their specialisation as what they wish, CAP is still a consideration. So far the only subject I have trouble understanding the lecturer is stats, most prof are Singaporean and speak rather well. Also, I survive 80% of my modules without the textbooks, notes are generally sufficient. Lastly, I have more NUS friends regretting not coming NBS instead.

I think you shouldn't get too caught up with reputation right now, it is something that shouldn't take precedence over your interests and your desired career - mainly because it isn't as important as you think it is. I've a senior, an IP student from one of the top JCs who scored straight B's for his A levels did not get called for an interview for his 1st nor 2nd choice at SMU. Fella decided to go to SIM to pursue his studies in a similar field and is earning quite a lot working as a trader for a fund now.  There are a lot of ways you can monetize your degree - as long as you are doing what you want to do you will think of ways to do so. If you're going to do Jap studies but you're interested in Finance, then do take some finance mods if that is possible, join a finance CCA, take up CFA, participate in competitions, write a paper on Japan and show your employer that you are well versed with Jap culture and at the same time highly passionate (and active) in the finance side of things - you will be an amazing hire for a company looking to expand into / their operations in Japan.  It is important for us not to get caught up with the rankings. I cannot stress this enough - at the end of the day, it is who you are, what you've done and how you're working towards your goals that matter, not the reputation of your University.  Just to share: the decision for me was simple back then - I've sorted out my interests, understood what I needed to do... so I picked the one that's closest to where I live  And my parents are both members of KRGH so that made the choice even more obvious! Thanks for the great advice!  I am offered to do Linguistics in NTU, and it's a more attractive offer now especially since I am offered a scholarship there. The truth is, I love languages, and I'm obsessed with Japanese as well. Been learning the language since P5, over 9 years liao. Been exposed to the culture since I was born, so I am very influenced and in love with it. But still, I don't really see the point in doing Japanese Studies.  I am a Tourism/Business student in NP, so I have both business and hospitality backgrounds to fall upon. I am thinking of being a translator/interpreter, but doing Jap Studies would be pointless since I can't just concentrate on just one language. Being an Eng teacher in Japan would be nice as well, and that would require linguistics studies... The worst thing is, both degrees have one of the lowest starting salary among all the degrees, am now hesitating on whether to appeal to NBS instead... :/ cGPA: ard 3.82 O level: L1R5=4, L1R4=6,11.452849134531945

I took amaths and economics during my secondary and poly time respectively. I also applied for nus fass for the previous 2 years, but they rejected me too which i dunno why.  Could it be the reason that i am serving ns now? I kinda at a loss about what to do. I dont really wanna go SIM with my gpa! No! In fact, NS should be an advantage especially if you get into command school! (That is also considered a non-accademic achievement) Other awards like best soldier may help too! NS is the best time to talk about your experiences and what made you decide (forgive me if I sound too drama or cliche) on going into that dream course! NTU/NUS/SMU requires students to write more about themselves for the courses they require to get into/why and there is a portion for non-accademic achievements. Remember to fill that up! Don't think it is not important because there are many people with the same GPA as you, so how do they consider applicants? To see if they have any additional talents/achievements they can bring with them outside their GPA!!! I cannot stress this enough, especially if you are from a poly! Also, I feel you about not being able to get into a local university of my choice! I screwed up my admission to get into my several dream courses at various Local U's during the first year because I thought they only look at GPA, and hence I didn't really bother much with the interview/and did not fill my non-CCA achievements. I thought I would definitely secure a place butI was so FRIGGIN WRONG. I felt like I was going to die literally because I couldn't get into a Local U. It was awful because I worked so friggin hard in poly D': Fortunately, I managed to pull myself together and manage to not screw up the second time and got into a local U with a course of my choice  So, DONT GIVE UP BRO. Now that you are closer to ORD, find some time to improve yourself, hunt down your poly lecturer to write you that testimonial letter for your university admission as they will really help. You are a merit holder, I am sure you have worked hard for it and paid attention during leessons. Your lecturers 会给你面子 if you are sincere and ask nicely!   If all else fails, there is always a local university route outside of NTU/NUS and it can be even better than the two.. but I can't say here.. later people will think I am biased towards certain university...

U ask them something that u are not sure, they will talk one big round and call u go read textbook when u dont understand what they talking. pay sch fee gam lan like that (before u tell me uni is self learning, or what sh1t u just go and google in youtube and see how the lecturers teach first okay) business sch all is like memorising liao, everything just vomit out. where got application in real world? those who got $$ i rather u go overseas la seriously. anyway just take this with a pinch of salt NBS yr2/acc here. Not sure if you are really from NBS. People study yes, mug day and night no. Average AUs per sem is around 17, can't see why you complaining. Each mod at most have 1 week of Elearning. I took blaw before and I don't remember any streaming video whatsoever. Recorded lecture is made available only to aid students who miss / have doubt after the lectures. NUS cannot choose their specialisation as what they wish, CAP is still a consideration. So far the only subject I have trouble understanding the lecturer is stats, most prof are Singaporean and speak rather well. Also, I survive 80% of my modules without the textbooks, notes are generally sufficient. Lastly, I have more NUS friends regretting not coming NBS instead. I can say with certainty NUS acc is way more competitive.,11.886094740535897

I think you shouldn't get too caught up with reputation right now, it is something that shouldn't take precedence over your interests and your desired career - mainly because it isn't as important as you think it is. I've a senior, an IP student from one of the top JCs who scored straight B's for his A levels did not get called for an interview for his 1st nor 2nd choice at SMU. Fella decided to go to SIM to pursue his studies in a similar field and is earning quite a lot working as a trader for a fund now.  There are a lot of ways you can monetize your degree - as long as you are doing what you want to do you will think of ways to do so. If you're going to do Jap studies but you're interested in Finance, then do take some finance mods if that is possible, join a finance CCA, take up CFA, participate in competitions, write a paper on Japan and show your employer that you are well versed with Jap culture and at the same time highly passionate (and active) in the finance side of things - you will be an amazing hire for a company looking to expand into / their operations in Japan.  It is important for us not to get caught up with the rankings. I cannot stress this enough - at the end of the day, it is who you are, what you've done and how you're working towards your goals that matter, not the reputation of your University.  Just to share: the decision for me was simple back then - I've sorted out my interests, understood what I needed to do... so I picked the one that's closest to where I live  And my parents are both members of KRGH so that made the choice even more obvious! Thanks for the great advice!  I am offered to do Linguistics in NTU, and it's a more attractive offer now especially since I am offered a scholarship there. The truth is, I love languages, and I'm obsessed with Japanese as well. Been learning the language since P5, over 9 years liao. Been exposed to the culture since I was born, so I am very influenced and in love with it. But still, I don't really see the point in doing Japanese Studies.  I am a Tourism/Business student in NP, so I have both business and hospitality backgrounds to fall upon. I am thinking of being a translator/interpreter, but doing Jap Studies would be pointless since I can't just concentrate on just one language. Being an Eng teacher in Japan would be nice as well, and that would require linguistics studies... The worst thing is, both degrees have one of the lowest starting salary among all the degrees, am now hesitating on whether to appeal to NBS instead... :/ cGPA: ard 3.82 O level: L1R5=4, L1R4=6,11.452849134531945

And what's with the BIZ anal flip class room thing. really makes me feel like flipping table instead. lol but nus biz is copying smu in some ways. even our profs are comparing. NUS biz is surely harder to score. NBS average bellcurve lies at around B+ while NUS biz lies around B.

So far nobody has ever throw my notes away leh. But i heard stories from senior that there are people who don't even teach their friends as they think it's damn stupid to help them due to the bellcurve. Personal feeling, people who refuses to teach generally do not score very well hence they feel insecure. For any of the peeps here, whatever course you go to, ignore the bell curve and teach. Nothing aid learning better than teaching your peers.averagewee wrote:  so far i haven't memorize anything for biz leh. Mostly got cheatsheet and biz cannot really memorize la. need quite a lot of critical thinking in some way. Biz in uni is quite different from poly in some way. Agreed, it works for NBS too. Not much memorization need with so many mod having open book and cheatsheet. Mods that i memorised generally only score a B+ or so because i fail to understand the concepts. Mod that i score A/ A+ hardly require much memorising since I get the concepts. Main point is that in Uni learn to understand and not memorise, non of the dean listers I see uses pure memory. People who say that mugging can give you your first class honors totally discount the understanding part.,11.337860121091227

And what's with the BIZ anal flip class room thing. really makes me feel like flipping table instead. lol but nus biz is copying smu in some ways. even our profs are comparing. NUS biz is surely harder to score. NBS average bellcurve lies at around B+ while NUS biz lies around B. Not to mention the accountancy cohort of NUS is 3 times smaller than NBS with people of much higher GPA/ Rank point going in.averagewee wrote:  eh not sure leh. for my sectional group we all like competitive in class but outside class like alright leh. So far nobody has ever throw my notes away leh. But i heard stories from senior that there are people who don't even teach their friends as they think it's damn stupid to help them due to the bellcurve. Personal feeling, people who refuses to teach generally do not score very well hence they feel insecure. For any of the peeps here, whatever course you go to, ignore the bell curve and teach. Nothing aid learning better than teaching your peers.averagewee wrote:  so far i haven't memorize anything for biz leh. Mostly got cheatsheet and biz cannot really memorize la. need quite a lot of critical thinking in some way. Biz in uni is quite different from poly in some way. Agreed, it works for NBS too. Not much memorization need with so many mod having open book and cheatsheet. Mods that i memorised generally only score a B+ or so because i fail to understand the concepts. Mod that i score A/ A+ hardly require much memorising since I get the concepts. Main point is that in Uni learn to understand and not memorise, non of the dean listers I see uses pure memory. People who say that mugging can give you your first class honors totally discount the understanding part.,11.337860121091227

Could answer the interview questions better with more matured viewpoints, but of course, was also thrown a few curveball questions such as, "Why do you intend to go back to school since you've already entered the workforce?" Hopefully I explained myself well enough to the interviewers, so can only hope for the best now.  Hahaha sorry for this terribly long post, but for all the poly kids who got rejected ... may my story remind you that it's definitely not the end, so don't give up ... You still have a few years to try for a place in local uni. In the meantime, you can always find a job like I did and work for a few years first. I have found that it can be equally, if not more, rewarding. Anyone remembers this zehzeh?  I GOT MY OFFER FOR NTU SOCIOLOGY today! This is the same exact course I had indicated as my first choice back in 2011 ...

Congrats on being shortlisted for SMU SIS interview! First and foremost, you can find numerous blogs and forums with information about the interview. That aside, I've just went for the interview on 9th April and have just received an acceptance email today. So I will be actually telling you what to expect for the interview but it may differ. Firstly, it is a group interview which  consists of 2 interviewers (professors) and 6 interviewees including you. Upon arrival, you will be led to a room by current SIS student volunteers where they will brief you through the interview progress. You will then be given 15 minutes to complete a form whereby you have to state specific examples of certain characteristics and traits (eg. Leadership, curiosity etc). On the same form you have to list down 3 questions you wanna ask the professors. Another 15 minutes will be given to you to design (sketch on a black paper) a Web page depending on the case study. Once completed, you will be led to another room where the interviewers will already be seated. One by one, you have to present your design to everybody. Do expect some questions to be asked by the professors pertaining to your design.  Next comes the famous SMU estimation question and you have 4 minutes to write down your answer on a piece of paper. The question I received was, "How many A4 sized papers are used for exam questions in SMU per semester." They do not care about your final answer but are more concern on your thought process. So make realistic and sound assumptions before arriving to your final answer. The professors may ask the origin of your assumption. So make sure you know how to explain. Lastly, the interview will end of with a Q&A session whereby questions you have listed on earlier will be answered. Do not list down questions which can be easily found on SMU's website.  Be confident and show your passion towards IS while presenting your ideas. SMU SIS looks for students who are able to analyse problems fast with critical thinking skills. As long as you make an effort to prepare for the interview, you have won half of the battle.

I remember last sem the mean and median for FA was 26 and 28. almost everybody got close to full marks and the exam was madness. And what's with the BIZ anal flip class room thing. really makes me feel like flipping table instead. lol but nus biz is copying smu in some ways. even our profs are comparing. NUS biz is surely harder to score. NBS average bellcurve lies at around B+ while NUS biz lies around B. Not to mention the accountancy cohort of NUS is 3 times smaller than NBS with people of much higher GPA/ Rank point going in.averagewee wrote:  eh not sure leh. for my sectional group we all like competitive in class but outside class like alright leh. So far nobody has ever throw my notes away leh. But i heard stories from senior that there are people who don't even teach their friends as they think it's damn stupid to help them due to the bellcurve. Personal feeling, people who refuses to teach generally do not score very well hence they feel insecure. For any of the peeps here, whatever course you go to, ignore the bell curve and teach. Nothing aid learning better than teaching your peers.averagewee wrote:  so far i haven't memorize anything for biz leh. Mostly got cheatsheet and biz cannot really memorize la. need quite a lot of critical thinking in some way. Biz in uni is quite different from poly in some way. Agreed, it works for NBS too. Not much memorization need with so many mod having open book and cheatsheet. Mods that i memorised generally only score a B+ or so because i fail to understand the concepts. Mod that i score A/ A+ hardly require much memorising since I get the concepts. Main point is that in Uni learn to understand and not memorise, non of the dean listers I see uses pure memory. People who say that mugging can give you your first class honors totally discount the understanding part.,11.337860121091227

Okay lah, NTU did give me an interview for NAA then, but I was young, fresh out of school and had a really naive impression of the world. Also, back then, I barely had a year's worth of working experience, so when the interviewers bombarded me with questions, they basically stepped all over me ... I walked out of the room feeling dejected and at that point, it sank in that the odds stacked against me in getting a place in university were really high.   So for the past three years, I've been slogging my wits out at work at the same company (pretty reputable), and I do have some tiny accomplishments to show. I felt that if I was granted a chance to present myself, I would definitely be much better than in 2011, so I decided to give it another shot this year. Also haha, because zeh zeh old liao, need to go back to school, if not it's now or never. True enough, this year, I got called for two interviews, but I don't know the application results yet. Could answer the interview questions better with more matured viewpoints, but of course, was also thrown a few curveball questions such as, "Why do you intend to go back to school since you've already entered the workforce?" Hopefully I explained myself well enough to the interviewers, so can only hope for the best now.  Hahaha sorry for this terribly long post, but for all the poly kids who got rejected ... may my story remind you that it's definitely not the end, so don't give up ... You still have a few years to try for a place in local uni. In the meantime, you can always find a job like I did and work for a few years first. I have found that it can be equally, if not more, rewarding. Anyone remembers this zehzeh?  I GOT MY OFFER FOR NTU SOCIOLOGY today! This is the same exact course I had indicated as my first choice back in 2011 ...  My same message stays: Don't give up if you don't get in now, there is a time and place for everything ... ,11.048728058533031

Congrats on being shortlisted for SMU SIS interview! First and foremost, you can find numerous blogs and forums with information about the interview. That aside, I've just went for the interview on 9th April and have just received an acceptance email today. So I will be actually telling you what to expect for the interview but it may differ. Firstly, it is a group interview which  consists of 2 interviewers (professors) and 6 interviewees including you. Upon arrival, you will be led to a room by current SIS student volunteers where they will brief you through the interview progress. You will then be given 15 minutes to complete a form whereby you have to state specific examples of certain characteristics and traits (eg. Leadership, curiosity etc). On the same form you have to list down 3 questions you wanna ask the professors. Another 15 minutes will be given to you to design (sketch on a black paper) a Web page depending on the case study. Once completed, you will be led to another room where the interviewers will already be seated. One by one, you have to present your design to everybody. Do expect some questions to be asked by the professors pertaining to your design.  Next comes the famous SMU estimation question and you have 4 minutes to write down your answer on a piece of paper. The question I received was, "How many A4 sized papers are used for exam questions in SMU per semester." They do not care about your final answer but are more concern on your thought process. So make realistic and sound assumptions before arriving to your final answer. The professors may ask the origin of your assumption. So make sure you know how to explain. Lastly, the interview will end of with a Q&A session whereby questions you have listed on earlier will be answered. Do not list down questions which can be easily found on SMU's website.  Be confident and show your passion towards IS while presenting your ideas. SMU SIS looks for students who are able to analyse problems fast with critical thinking skills. As long as you make an effort to prepare for the interview, you have won half of the battle. With that,  I wish you all the best for the interview Hi, went for the same interview on 18th of March(think maybe first batch), but until now still no news lol? does it mean I will be rejected bro??,11.043701252764105
