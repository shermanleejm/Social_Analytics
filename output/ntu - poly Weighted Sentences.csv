I think you shouldn't get too caught up with reputation right now, it is something that shouldn't take precedence over your interests and your desired career - mainly because it isn't as important as you think it is. I've a senior, an IP student from one of the top JCs who scored straight B's for his A levels did not get called for an interview for his 1st nor 2nd choice at SMU. Fella decided to go to SIM to pursue his studies in a similar field and is earning quite a lot working as a trader for a fund now.  There are a lot of ways you can monetize your degree - as long as you are doing what you want to do you will think of ways to do so. If you're going to do Jap studies but you're interested in Finance, then do take some finance mods if that is possible, join a finance CCA, take up CFA, participate in competitions, write a paper on Japan and show your employer that you are well versed with Jap culture and at the same time highly passionate (and active) in the finance side of things - you will be an amazing hire for a company looking to expand into / their operations in Japan.  It is important for us not to get caught up with the rankings. I cannot stress this enough - at the end of the day, it is who you are, what you've done and how you're working towards your goals that matter, not the reputation of your University.  Just to share: the decision for me was simple back then - I've sorted out my interests, understood what I needed to do... so I picked the one that's closest to where I live  And my parents are both members of KRGH so that made the choice even more obvious! Thanks for the great advice!  I am offered to do Linguistics in NTU, and it's a more attractive offer now especially since I am offered a scholarship there. The truth is, I love languages, and I'm obsessed with Japanese as well. Been learning the language since P5, over 9 years liao. Been exposed to the culture since I was born, so I am very influenced and in love with it. But still, I don't really see the point in doing Japanese Studies.  I am a Tourism/Business student in NP, so I have both business and hospitality backgrounds to fall upon. I am thinking of being a translator/interpreter, but doing Jap Studies would be pointless since I can't just concentrate on just one language. Being an Eng teacher in Japan would be nice as well, and that would require linguistics studies... The worst thing is, both degrees have one of the lowest starting salary among all the degrees, am now hesitating on whether to appeal to NBS instead... :/ cGPA: ard 3.82 O level: L1R5=4, L1R4=6",11.362523545392294

Margins bla bla. No, it doesn't matter. Thing is, if everyone with a 3.99 GPA applied for the course you have been given right now, they would still kick you out to make space for these guys. Are you above the IGP? Yes. Can you still be rejected? Definitely. So don't refer to the IGP already.  But if everything plays out fine, and even if you drop by 0.1, you will probably still be accepted. Exceptions to the case might be med/dent/law. But otherwise, I don't think it will matter to them. Why are you so worked up about the IGP, the open and close inverted commas should alr mean that it isnt really a cut-off, the only reason I used it was for a rough gauge, because that is the closest thing any of us have to measure our chances of entering a course we want. What you say is true, but the chances of that happening can be as good as zero, though the IGP fluctuates every year and works similar to the polytechnic cut-off point, it is still the closes guide we have to choosing which course we have a chance to get into and which we don't. As for the situation, yea, not aiming for those 3, am actually aiming for FASS in NUS and trying to salvage my current situation anyway I can.  On a side-note, has anyone from poly purposely failed a semester that they did badly in to have a forward semester to actually do better? Does it have any other effects, like maybe a record of you failing a semester, or a maximum grade attainable for the forward semester, etc?",9.18974668176936

Basically you have to add the mods that you have in your stars planner into stars! (Click add courses to stars under stars planner to do that) Once you click add, you'll then see a list of GERPES and UEs that you have selected in your planner! (At this point your cores will be omitted 'cos it has alr been pre-assigned to you, so you don't have to remove from the planner or anything! The system will only show the GERPES/UEs that you planned)  You'll get to rank the GERPES and UES 1-5 according to preference :-) take note that you can add up to 5 modules and at any one time 5 modules can be on your waitlist! Its encouraged that you try to add as many up to 5 if you can 'cos that'll increase your chances of getting smth! In any case if you get more than what you wanted, you are always allowed to drop the mods during the add/drop period Bear in mind that it's not fastest fingers first/first-come-first-serve basis! As long as you add your courses into stars by 10pm each day, you'll be in the ballot pool :-) Everyday at 10pm, the system will randomly do a ballot and if you get the courses that you want, great! You can start going for those lessons as per schedule. But if you don't, you can still go for the lecture if you want to know more about the module or if you think that there's a chance you will be registered in the coming days!  You'll be allowed to add/drop your mods for a two-week period starting from tomorrow! But fret not even if you don't get the mods that you want on the first try since you have up to two weeks to either a) continue waiting if you rly rly want the mod or if the number on the waitlist is not too high or b) drop that mod from the wait list and try for something else. ☺️",7.939452319670109

Last time only 20% of a cohort would have made it to local uni.

My passage was an extract from this rather 'ancient' philosopher's book. About 1.5 pages long with word size of probably 10.

I just answered straight to the point with as much detailed and concise elaborations (probably barely half a page). So if you have the same worry as me, just remember that quality can definitely make up for quantity. At least I know that if I had written 1 page long, my answer will probably be worse off >.< No time for flowery language honestly. Second part was the actual interview by professors.

My name starts with 'A', so I was interviewed first in my group. 3 interviews were carried out simultaneously in various offices. There isn't a time limit per se, so I guess you could ramble on for as long as you prefer. During the interview, my interviewer ran through the process with me first. 3 main questions. 1. Something more academic, based on the written test. So it was like a chance to elaborate on what you've missed out, or for you to clarify on certain thoughts. No hard and fast rule with this. 2. Based on philosophy's fields of study, talk about what interests you in Philo. (It's basically why you chose Philosophy).  3. Elaborate on CCAs, what made you who you are, what changed your beliefs, any turning points in life etc (that kind of questions). Do take note though, the interviewer may refer (many times) to your application, be it choice of courses, CCA, results and what you wrote for discretionary etc. As for my interviewer, it seemed like he took a good look at the hardcopy of my application. Thank goodness I remembered the details of it.  Also, he actually made it very obvious that he's jotting down pointers of what you say from first question onwards, and he will write things that impresses him as you speak. So feel free to share your glorious history with your interviewer (of course it has to have some link with his main questions). Lastly, the interviewer will ask you if you have any queries. Ask something sensible and pertaining to philosophy or the school's pedagogy. You can PM me if you want to know what I asked. The interview process was a rather enjoyable one, semi-formal? We had a nice chat on some aspects of philosophy that I was interested in; and there's really nothing wrong if you're not sure on how to answer the questions.

NS is the best time to talk about your experiences and what made you decide (forgive me if I sound too drama or cliche) on going into that dream course!

Don't think it is not important because there are many people with the same GPA as you, so how do they consider applicants? To see if they have any additional talents/achievements they can bring with them outside their GPA!!! I cannot stress this enough, especially if you are from a poly! Also, I feel you about not being able to get into a local university of my choice! I screwed up my admission to get into my several dream courses at various Local U's during the first year because I thought they only look at GPA, and hence I didn't really bother much with the interview/and did not fill my non-CCA achievements. I thought I would definitely secure a place butI was so FRIGGIN WRONG. I felt like I was going to die literally because I couldn't get into a Local U. It was awful because I worked so friggin hard in poly D': Fortunately, I managed to pull myself together and manage to not screw up the second time and got into a local U with a course of my choice  So, DONT GIVE UP BRO. Now that you are closer to ORD, find some time to improve yourself, hunt down your poly lecturer to write you that testimonial letter for your university admission as they will really help. You are a merit holder, I am sure you have worked hard for it and paid attention during leessons. Your lecturers 会给你面子 if you are sincere and ask nicely!

NUS cannot choose their specialisation as what they wish, CAP is still a consideration. So far the only subject I have trouble understanding the lecturer is stats, most prof are Singaporean and speak rather well.

I've been offered NTU Maritime Studies from 2012 and NUS Mechanical Engineering this year.  Initially, I swayed towards Maritime but am afraid that it is too specialized and am afraid that job prospects could be bad in 4 or so years time.  Mechanical Engineering is very broad and prospects seem better but I'm not really sure if I really wanna do it.  If both NUS and NTU offered me the same course, I'll choose NUS. But the different courses are making my choice difficult. Pls let me know your views. Any advice is greatly appreciated. Thanks Christ... For pete's sake, NUS and NTU - No f**king difference. When you graduate from either schools from the same course like mech eng to mech eng, employment will be the same. The school's name will not shortchange you of anything. Want to go with that ""NUS better branding"" thinking then please, be sure to tell your employer from the private sector that, instead of choosing the school with the modules you want to study so that you can score well. Same pay, same platform to begin, its not a private school, stop dwelling on it. Mech eng can look at companies like Pratt and Whitney, Rollys Royce, Hyflux, Shell, BP, basically companies that have automation require engineers to maintain, improve and develop them. Get FCH then you can try finance side too, iron rice bowl afterall. Maritime studies is interesting. Its a social science degree. You won't learn engineering there or in depth navigation. You will be taught things like international trade, international law I think, economics, basically the business side of the marine trading industry in Singapore. Can come out as a consultant. I see that NTU has affiliations with MPA so that's a good start. However, it is a niche field, its NOT engineering.  Honestly, I would take mech eng, not that maritime sounds bad. If you have interest in it, then gun it, do f**king well and get headhunted by stat board or private firms.  But please please, look at what you will be learning in these 2 distinct and different courses then make a decision. The modules are online, you can take a look at what you will learn, what tie ups does the school have, what internships can you be looking at, what is the cohort size to assess your competition like. Look at all this first, then make a sound decision rather than lament which school is better. You've already made it to a local U, your not going to do post grad studies after your degree at INSEAD of NUS MBA so, NUS/NTU - SAME PLAYING FIELD",11.703517196978707

That aside, I've just went for the interview on 9th April and have just received an acceptance email today. So I will be actually telling you what to expect for the interview but it may differ. Firstly, it is a group interview which  consists of 2 interviewers (professors) and 6 interviewees including you. Upon arrival, you will be led to a room by current SIS student volunteers where they will brief you through the interview progress. You will then be given 15 minutes to complete a form whereby you have to state specific examples of certain characteristics and traits (eg. Leadership, curiosity etc). On the same form you have to list down 3 questions you wanna ask the professors. Another 15 minutes will be given to you to design (sketch on a black paper) a Web page depending on the case study. Once completed, you will be led to another room where the interviewers will already be seated. One by one, you have to present your design to everybody. Do expect some questions to be asked by the professors pertaining to your design.  Next comes the famous SMU estimation question and you have 4 minutes to write down your answer on a piece of paper. The question I received was, ""How many A4 sized papers are used for exam questions in SMU per semester."" They do not care about your final answer but are more concern on your thought process. So make realistic and sound assumptions before arriving to your final answer. The professors may ask the origin of your assumption. So make sure you know how to explain. Lastly, the interview will end of with a Q&A session whereby questions you have listed on earlier will be answered. Do not list down questions which can be easily found on SMU's website.  Be confident and show your passion towards IS while presenting your ideas. SMU SIS looks for students who are able to analyse problems fast with critical thinking skills.

I got ACCE (Soc/ Law/ E. Lit/ Econs). I submitted my first year's first term results too; I'm not sure if that would actually help with my application or that it would be more detrimental. It isn't that I'm not coping well academically but more of a personal issue, thus my decision to apply to Singapore.  What then would you say my chances are with an appeal? And also that apparently there is a 2nd window offer by SMU? How does that work? (Thanks for the reply) No offense, but your chances are zero. Grades are not up to par. And you chose small and relatively popular courses. Humanities/SS courses are gaining a following here. If you were inclined towards engineering, your chances would've been at least a little better, but I doubt you'd still get in with those grades, once again, no offense meant. That said, you can still appeal and try your luck. But don't get your hopes up. Not a 2nd window but more like just a second batch. Offers come in batches. Usually applicants get 2-3 offers between NUS/NTU/SMU/SUTD. So once a person confirms a place, it leaves the other unpicked place empty and then it is given to another applicant who is on the waiting list or to a person who appeals. There is no need to apply a second time.  If you are quite desperate to get into Singapore, the only chance would be to re-sit for the A-levels, or take the SAT. But once again, close to perfect grades will be required. Your first term results won't make much of a difference IMO, won't improve or be detrimental to the situation. The universities here are not too keen on transfers. Even between NUS/NTU/SMU themselves, transfers are very hard to come by. They'd rather a person applies as a new applicant and starts afresh.

Grades are not up to par. And you chose small and relatively popular courses. Humanities/SS courses are gaining a following here. If you were inclined towards engineering, your chances would've been at least a little better, but I doubt you'd still get in with those grades, once again, no offense meant. That said, you can still appeal and try your luck. But don't get your hopes up. Not a 2nd window but more like just a second batch. Offers come in batches. Usually applicants get 2-3 offers between NUS/NTU/SMU/SUTD. So once a person confirms a place, it leaves the other unpicked place empty and then it is given to another applicant who is on the waiting list or to a person who appeals. There is no need to apply a second time.  If you are quite desperate to get into Singapore, the only chance would be to re-sit for the A-levels, or take the SAT. But once again, close to perfect grades will be required. Your first term results won't make much of a difference IMO, won't improve or be detrimental to the situation. The universities here are not too keen on transfers. Even between NUS/NTU/SMU themselves, transfers are very hard to come by. They'd rather a person applies as a new applicant and starts afresh. And because they are unable to look into the grading criteria of another institute, they are unable to completely judge a person by their term-by-term university results. Right. No offense taken. I've had this coming anyway and I know that the chances of getting in is close to zero. Just thought I could try anyway.  So for SMU, I'll have to wait until they send me some form of reply? Is it in the form of a letter and not email? (or perhaps both?)  How then does the appeal system work?",9.753918051556214

At first, i also believe it will be chaotic, guess things do not turn out as bad as how i will imagine haha. Not sure is the seniors or peers you mentioned from NBS. In NBS, i can assure you average is surely nearer to B+ than to B.   Also, personally, I will choose NBS over NUS business school.  Firstly, ranking wise, both school is on par with NBS having a longer history and hence better reputation.  Secondly, NUS average is around B while NBS average is around B+. (Both is by estimation) When working, people cares about what honors you get and having a better average helps. Thirdly, NBS cohort is way bigger than NUS cohort. It is known that it is easier to score better in a larger bell curve than a smaller one. Fourthly, NUS IGP is way higher than NBS. If the smaller bell curve isn't bad enough, the competition level in NUS is surely higher. At the end of the day, both schools provide the same degree so why go to the tougher one? Fifthly, NBS is 3 years as compared to NUS being 4 years (assuming you are aiming for honors)  Lastly, NUS do not allow students to go exchange after Y3S1 and all accounting mod need to be cleared in Singapore (making it way harder to go exchange) while NBS allow you to go any semester and most modules can be mapped overseas except for FRS related or law related modules (Eg: tax). PS: Since i am from NBS, i am probably slightly bias, but i believe the points i mention are surely legit and can be part of your consideration.  Haha Thanks for your input! I believe it'll be pretty useful for me when I make a decision. Didn't know about the bell curve thing. Initially, I thought like big cohort means it'll be way more difficult to score as compared to a small cohort! Haha. Did you stay in a hall in the first year? How was it?

In a media release on Friday (Dec 11), NP said polytechnic graduates who participate in the SkillsFuture Earn-and-Learn Programme for Accountancy will get to acquire work experience and professional skills while pursuing further study options part-time, through a ""structured work-study pathway"".  The qualification, offered by NP in collaboration with the Singapore Accountancy Commission (SAC), will see polytechnic graduates who successfully complete the 18-month programme awarded with an Advanced Diploma in Accountancy.  ""The certification offers an alternative pathway for polytechnic graduates and part-time students to become Chartered Accountants of Singapore, without first having to obtain degree qualifications. Upon completion of the Earn-and-Learn Programme, they will be eligible to enrol in the Singapore Qualification Programme (QP),"" NP said. The diploma's curriculum was jointly developed by NP and SAC, the polytechnic said, adding that SAC has also engaged industry players for both the SkillsFuture Earn-and-Learn Programme as well as Enhanced Internships for the Accountancy and Financial Services Sector.  At present, polytechnic graduates have to first complete an accredited accountancy degree and the Singapore QP before they could quality to be Chartered Accountants of Singapore. Those without an accredited degree have to go through an additional Foundation Programme before proceeding to the Singapore QP, NP said.  POLYTECHNIC, ITE STUDENTS OFFERED ENHANCED INTERNSHIPS NP also announced on Friday that polytechnic and ITE students will be offered enhanced internships in the Accountancy and Financial Services sector from 2016 under the SkillsFuture initiative.  NP, Nanyang Polytechnic, Republic Polytechnic, Singapore Polytechnic, Temasek Polytechnic and the Institute of Technical Education (ITE) signed a Memorandum of Understanding with 16 accounting companies and financial institutions to provide these internships to their students on Friday afternoon, NP said.  The enhanced internships are longer than usual internship stints, and are structured with clear learning outcomes and job scopes. They will also be matched with industry mentors who will guide them at the workplace and advise them on career growth in the sector. They will be rolled out in 2016 for 2,400 polytechnic and ITE students.  Companies on board include Baker Tilly TFW, BDO, Citibank, DBS, Deloitte & Touche, Ernst & Young, Foo Kon Tan, HSBC, KPMG, Mazars, Nexia TS Public Accounting Corporation, OCBC, PricewaterhouseCoopers, RSM Stone Forest, Singapore Exchange and UOB.  - CNA/dl",8.973020436601741

There is a pre-determined quota, and each category of applicants only compete within their own category. (Exception is perhaps Law & Medicine with additional Admission Tests/Scores) 2. A Levels grade is subjected to moderation and hence more resistant to grade inflation, whereas poly only has an artificial form of quota on As for assessments. Even the exact same GPA across 2 years may not be a good comparison. 3. The culture, mindset, considerations etc of JC vs Poly students may tend to be different, with more poly students leaning towards a shorter course to 'catch up' their counterparts. --- These roughly explain the difference in trends between A levels and GPA in the IGP. --- That said, one of the recommendations made by the committee on university education is to abolish the set quota of JC and Poly intake.

To attract the best students, the universities are striving to be different - in their programmes, tuition fees, student and faculty mix, accommodation options, financial help and overseas opportunities. Calvin Yang looks at the options offered. FULL-TIME DEGREE PROGRAMMES National University of Singapore (NUS): It has more than 50 full-time degrees, with exclusive ones such as those in dentistry, music and pharmacy. Nanyang Technological University (NTU): It has more than 50 degrees, with niche programmes such as communication studies, and sport science and management. Singapore Management University (SMU): It offers seven full-time programmes such as accountancy, law, information systems management and an SUTD-SMU dual degree programme in technology and management, launched last year. Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD): Its five degrees include architecture and sustainable design, engineering product development, engineering systems and design, and information systems technology and design. Singapore Institute of Technology (SIT): Catering mainly to polytechnic graduates, the university has 36 programmes - some offered by reputable partner universities and others run solely by SIT. The programmes include culinary arts management, criminology and security, game design and naval architecture. SIM University (UniSIM): The university synonymous with part-time degrees recently started offering full-time programmes in accountancy, finance and marketing. It will introduce a fourth full-time degree in human resource management this year. TUITION FEES These are for Singaporean students admitted in the academic year 2014/2015, except for UniSIM undergraduates. NUS: Annual tuition fees range between $7,850 - for courses like computing, engineering, and arts and social sciences - and $24,200 for medicine and dentistry. NTU: Fees are between $7,850 for most programmes, and $31,500 for medical students. SMU: Undergraduates who started last August are paying $11,100 per year, except for law students, who are paying $12,300. SUTD: An education at the university costs $11,650 per year. SIT: Annual fees range from $10,100 to $15,300. UniSIM: This year's accountancy students will pay about $33,000 for the entire degree programme, while students from other programmes will pay about $31,000. FINANCIAL HELP NUS: It has a wide range of scholarships and financial aid available. Over the past five years, it has seen a two-fold increase in students receiving scholarships, from about 800 in 2009 to 1,650 in 2013. There was a 60 per cent increase in the number of students receiving bursaries over the same period. NTU: For the new academic year that starts in August, it will be providing about 500 full-term scholarships, namely the Nanyang Scholarship and College Scholarship. Singaporean students interested in taking up a bursary each will receive assistance as long as their household per capita income is $1,900 or less per month. SMU: It has a comprehensive range of financial schemes. For scholarships, about 60 per cent of those who apply have been successful in securing a scholarship supported by the university or its donors. SUTD: It offers 173 scholarships and 43 bursaries, excluding government ones. SIT: More than 10 per cent of students are on scholarships or sponsorships by their employers or prospective employers. UniSIM: About a dozen scholarships, such as the SIM University Scholarship, and bursaries, such as the Ministry of Education Bursary, are available to students. STUDENT RESIDENCES NUS: The six halls of residence, four student residences and five residential colleges offer about 11,000 places in all for full-time students. A one-week stay in a typical single, non-air-conditioned room costs between $110 and $130. NTU: Its 18 residential halls house more than 10,400 undergraduates. Rental fees range from $225 to $280 monthly for a twin-sharing room. SMU: It does not have any student residences for local students. SUTD: It has three student housing blocks with a capacity of around 1,100 beds. Depending on the room type, an undergraduate typically pays around $350 to $480 per month. SIT: It does not offer any student residences. UniSIM: It does not have any student accommodation. OVERSEAS EXPOSURE NUS: About 70 per cent of undergraduates have at least an overseas exposure stint, such as summer school or internships. NTU: Some 80 per cent of students get some form of overseas exposure, such as taking classes at a partner university overseas. SMU: About 86 per cent of students have some form of overseas exposure, mainly through student exchange programmes. SUTD: Nearly 60 per cent of undergraduates have overseas experience. SIT: All students taking programmes offered by its partner universities abroad must go for an Overseas Immersion Programme as part of the curriculum. They spend between three and 17 weeks at the home campus of the university. Also, nearly all undergraduates doing SIT's own programmes have gone on study trips and work-study initiatives overseas. UniSIM: Its full-time students must go for an overseas stint during their studies. Currently, they have not started their stints, which may include a work attachment programme or a service learning project.",12.282625752553573

I have a friend who actually transferred from MAE to NBS lol.  Thing is, for a lot of people, A-level grades and poly GPA have little influence on University performance. My A-level grades were CDD but I'm maintaining a first class now lol. So its not impossible.  Maybe for poly people, your poly GPA and uni GPA is more related if your poly course is similar to your university course. But for the rest who are from JC or are from unrelated poly courses, you will never know how they perform in uni.  The process of switching course is very simple. In your first year, take NBS modules as electives, drop some of your cores in order to make space and time for those electives. Score well in those NBS modules and then apply for transfer. Of course, the scoring well part is usually the difficult part. But if you really want it its actually not that difficult. All you need is around the range of B+/A-. You need the range of A-/A. The threshold for a transfer in has increased considerably. You need a ~4.0+ for internal transfer (from biz to acc, but acc to biz is a free deal, gpa less than 3 also can), and 4.5+ from another faculty.  If you are a CCC student who manage to make a come back and get a First Class, then yes, this is the group that may stand a chance. But I daresay not many would be in this category. For poly students in particular, the correlation is very real. Mind you, I was the book prize winner (top student) in certain modules in poly, and I still get B+/A- here despite best efforts. If your poly GPA isn't high enough to get into business, then you are unlikely to score well enough in the same mods to transfer in, unless you work super hard. (And yes, everyone works super work in Year 1) Another hurdle you may face is with effect from 2015, many NBS modules are no longer available as Unrestricted Electives. This is due to some new 2nd Major partnership, and the 'extra seats' we had last time is now given to this group. I just checked the intranet and confirm there are very very few common cores that non-nbs students are permitted to take.  All that said, if you're really brave, there really isn't anything to lose by applying for the transfer after Y1S1.  I wouldn't, however, recommend you entering NTU with the mindset or expectation that it would be easy.",10.949554384095837

Any substandard answer to answer your desperate question is as good as not answering.

You better think harder with your coconut brain (filled with water), if you have such high respect for asking something that is unknown to you right here, then prepared for any answer. If you already have some answers you think is more useful to you, that means you already knows the answer, then why bother to ask. Just go and figure thinks out yourself and move on destroy the future of your sibling. And you are quite right on your perspective. It's indeed stupid and getting nowhere. If that's the case, I recommend you take the tuition fee, walk right into the casino and gamble it, you might have better outcomes. Right now, you are asking your sister walk into something she has not set her heart into, with no commitment to succeed.

Yup, I think that would pose a problem for anyone who wants to transfer in. But there are still a few modules available.

But if you really don't like your current course you won't have much to lose. Also, everyone has to take some UEs anyway. Engine students take 5UEs and HSS has 10UEs. So you will still be able to graduate in 4 years time if you don't get to transfer as long as you don't do more than the allocated UEs.

I'm thinking of appealing to smu biz since the appeal period is still open but I heard from the staff there that whatever accolades u have (I have prev ran my own business as my FYP with healthy profits) is pretty much secondary. Is it really true? In this case how should I draft my appeal letter cus I was pretty much banking on this to get my way into smu. 4. Is there any NTU sociology students out there? I have a placing there but I'm worried that I might not be measure up in terms of the style of assignments being like GP since I came from poly. What kind of assignments do they have and the mode of testings? Thank you guys1. Dont appeal to the Deans directly. Dean level are too high, they dont micro-manage down to the undergraduate admissions level. At most they do get involved in grad students admissions. Try appealing to an Assoc Prof or an Asst Prof.  2. I believe there is only one window of official appeal. Any appeals outside of the NTU system(ie. directly to the prof) would be counted as informal appeals. 4. Soci is essay and exam based. There is always a compulsory module in your first semester that will teach you how to craft uni-level essays.",10.039768269146666

To attract the best students, the universities are striving to be different - in their programmes, tuition fees, student and faculty mix, accommodation options, financial help and overseas opportunities. Calvin Yang looks at the options offered. FULL-TIME DEGREE PROGRAMMES National University of Singapore (NUS): It has more than 50 full-time degrees, with exclusive ones such as those in dentistry, music and pharmacy. Nanyang Technological University (NTU): It has more than 50 degrees, with niche programmes such as communication studies, and sport science and management. Singapore Management University (SMU): It offers seven full-time programmes such as accountancy, law, information systems management and an SUTD-SMU dual degree programme in technology and management, launched last year. Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD): Its five degrees include architecture and sustainable design, engineering product development, engineering systems and design, and information systems technology and design. Singapore Institute of Technology (SIT): Catering mainly to polytechnic graduates, the university has 36 programmes - some offered by reputable partner universities and others run solely by SIT. The programmes include culinary arts management, criminology and security, game design and naval architecture. SIM University (UniSIM): The university synonymous with part-time degrees recently started offering full-time programmes in accountancy, finance and marketing. It will introduce a fourth full-time degree in human resource management this year. TUITION FEES These are for Singaporean students admitted in the academic year 2014/2015, except for UniSIM undergraduates. NUS: Annual tuition fees range between $7,850 - for courses like computing, engineering, and arts and social sciences - and $24,200 for medicine and dentistry. NTU: Fees are between $7,850 for most programmes, and $31,500 for medical students. SMU: Undergraduates who started last August are paying $11,100 per year, except for law students, who are paying $12,300. SUTD: An education at the university costs $11,650 per year. SIT: Annual fees range from $10,100 to $15,300. UniSIM: This year's accountancy students will pay about $33,000 for the entire degree programme, while students from other programmes will pay about $31,000. FINANCIAL HELP NUS: It has a wide range of scholarships and financial aid available. Over the past five years, it has seen a two-fold increase in students receiving scholarships, from about 800 in 2009 to 1,650 in 2013. There was a 60 per cent increase in the number of students receiving bursaries over the same period. NTU: For the new academic year that starts in August, it will be providing about 500 full-term scholarships, namely the Nanyang Scholarship and College Scholarship. Singaporean students interested in taking up a bursary each will receive assistance as long as their household per capita income is $1,900 or less per month. SMU: It has a comprehensive range of financial schemes. For scholarships, about 60 per cent of those who apply have been successful in securing a scholarship supported by the university or its donors. SUTD: It offers 173 scholarships and 43 bursaries, excluding government ones. SIT: More than 10 per cent of students are on scholarships or sponsorships by their employers or prospective employers. UniSIM: About a dozen scholarships, such as the SIM University Scholarship, and bursaries, such as the Ministry of Education Bursary, are available to students. STUDENT RESIDENCES NUS: The six halls of residence, four student residences and five residential colleges offer about 11,000 places in all for full-time students. A one-week stay in a typical single, non-air-conditioned room costs between $110 and $130. NTU: Its 18 residential halls house more than 10,400 undergraduates. Rental fees range from $225 to $280 monthly for a twin-sharing room. SMU: It does not have any student residences for local students. SUTD: It has three student housing blocks with a capacity of around 1,100 beds. Depending on the room type, an undergraduate typically pays around $350 to $480 per month. SIT: It does not offer any student residences. UniSIM: It does not have any student accommodation. OVERSEAS EXPOSURE NUS: About 70 per cent of undergraduates have at least an overseas exposure stint, such as summer school or internships. NTU: Some 80 per cent of students get some form of overseas exposure, such as taking classes at a partner university overseas. SMU: About 86 per cent of students have some form of overseas exposure, mainly through student exchange programmes. SUTD: Nearly 60 per cent of undergraduates have overseas experience. SIT: All students taking programmes offered by its partner universities abroad must go for an Overseas Immersion Programme as part of the curriculum. They spend between three and 17 weeks at the home campus of the university. Also, nearly all undergraduates doing SIT's own programmes have gone on study trips and work-study initiatives overseas. UniSIM: Its full-time students must go for an overseas stint during their studies. Currently, they have not started their stints, which may include a work attachment programme or a service learning project.",12.188893491113916

I am curious on the percentage of students graduating with 3rd class honours and above. For NTU chemistry its a lot. In fact I think most of them get at least 3rd class. Its actually not that hard. Probably about 85% get to graduate with an honours. But third class is actually quite low. The average point is probably somewhere in-between second upper and second lower. NUS is quite different. Because they are not direct-honours, they can choose to graduate in 3 years with just a pass bach degree. This is different from NTU whereby even if you are not going to get an honours, you still have to complete the 4 year degree. I know some people in NUS choose to not do honours even if they qualify for honours because their CAP quite low anyways and they don't see the point in doing an extra year just to get a second lower or a third class honours.  For NUS you can see the undergraduate statistics here: https://share.nus.edu.sg/registrar/i...l-20142015.pdf As you can see under Science, the number of students from year 1, 2 and 3 is about 1000+ but honours year dips to 600+. So about 60% of them choose to stay for honours. Out of this 60% who choose to stay probably all of them actually get their honours unless they fk up badly in their final year which is unlikely. NTU also has similar undergraduate statistics but you can't really infer much since those with no honours still have to continue on to fourth year.",6.938869995080902

In a media release on Friday (Dec 11), NP said polytechnic graduates who participate in the SkillsFuture Earn-and-Learn Programme for Accountancy will get to acquire work experience and professional skills while pursuing further study options part-time, through a ""structured work-study pathway"".  The qualification, offered by NP in collaboration with the Singapore Accountancy Commission (SAC), will see polytechnic graduates who successfully complete the 18-month programme awarded with an Advanced Diploma in Accountancy.  ""The certification offers an alternative pathway for polytechnic graduates and part-time students to become Chartered Accountants of Singapore, without first having to obtain degree qualifications. Upon completion of the Earn-and-Learn Programme, they will be eligible to enrol in the Singapore Qualification Programme (QP),"" NP said. The diploma's curriculum was jointly developed by NP and SAC, the polytechnic said, adding that SAC has also engaged industry players for both the SkillsFuture Earn-and-Learn Programme as well as Enhanced Internships for the Accountancy and Financial Services Sector.  At present, polytechnic graduates have to first complete an accredited accountancy degree and the Singapore QP before they could quality to be Chartered Accountants of Singapore. Those without an accredited degree have to go through an additional Foundation Programme before proceeding to the Singapore QP, NP said.  POLYTECHNIC, ITE STUDENTS OFFERED ENHANCED INTERNSHIPS NP also announced on Friday that polytechnic and ITE students will be offered enhanced internships in the Accountancy and Financial Services sector from 2016 under the SkillsFuture initiative.  NP, Nanyang Polytechnic, Republic Polytechnic, Singapore Polytechnic, Temasek Polytechnic and the Institute of Technical Education (ITE) signed a Memorandum of Understanding with 16 accounting companies and financial institutions to provide these internships to their students on Friday afternoon, NP said.  The enhanced internships are longer than usual internship stints, and are structured with clear learning outcomes and job scopes. They will also be matched with industry mentors who will guide them at the workplace and advise them on career growth in the sector. They will be rolled out in 2016 for 2,400 polytechnic and ITE students.

2016,nanyang technological university|ntu|computer|com|infosys|information systems|analytics|smart city,Republic Polytechnic|Republic poly|rp,"SINGAPORE: Three of Singapore's autonomous universities are refining the way they admit students under the Discretionary Admissions Scheme, which looks beyond a person's academic achievements. It comes as the universities prepare to take in more students under the scheme, when the current cap of 10 per cent allowed for discretionary admissions goes up to 15 per cent next year. ADVERTISING inRead invented by Teads National University of Singapore (NUS) is offering 7,000 places for the coming academic year, but it has received four times the number of applicants. While it has started handing out offers to those who made the cut based on their grades, about 1,800 students who did not are undergoing interviews to be considered for discretionary admissions this year. NUS has been evaluating and admitting more students under the scheme over the years. Last year, it evaluated 1,600 students, 400 more than 2014. 670 of them got in, 70 more than 2014. With more students expected to be considered for discretionary admissions, the process at NUS may be refined. Said Professor Tan Eng Chye, deputy president of academic affairs at NUS: “We are evolving; for instance, we have gotten alumni to help us with the interviews. I find that very useful because the alumni have a lot of experience in sizing up people and candidates, and they ask very useful questions. “We also provide more data on what to look out for and if the numbers get to be big, we may decide that maybe we can have sort of a test first - not an academic test per se, but perhaps a test to look at other non-academic aspects of that person. It could be an aptitude test.” Prof Tan added: “Exercising flexibility is one aspect; you also have to be fairly sharp on what to look for - it is not simply: 'OK, meet the numbers.' Our interest is to look for attributes of the applicants that would make the student community more interesting, more diversified, and enhance the interaction within the student community. “Those who can adequately and can eloquently convey their passions and interests - that would be advantageous. But we also have to look out for students who may not be able to communicate as well, but yet they have the potential for us to groom them to be able graduates.” At the Singapore Management University (SMU), discretionary admissions currently form about 5 to 8 per cent of the annual intake. With the higher cap of 15 per cent for such admissions next year, the university will have ""more leeway"" when assessing students. Professor Pang Yang Hoong, vice provost for undergraduate matters and student development at SMU, said: “For SMU, looking at students with other qualifications is not something terribly new because we always been holistic in the way we assess students and their suitability for admission. We will be more flexible. “(We look for) passion, the aptitude for the course for which we are admitting them into. It would also be ideal if students have demonstrated that they are successful to be in time management, that they also possess resilience and the ability to overcome difficult situations. This will help us to assess if that person has got the resilience and the determination to do well in the programme.” SMU is expecting more polytechnic graduates to apply through the discretionary route with the cap being raised to 15 per cent of the annual intake. Nanyang Technological University (NTU) will also ""broaden the criteria"", to give more people a shot at securing a place. It will favourably consider those who possess ""enthusiasm and relevant work experience"". Professor Kam Chan Hin, senior associate provost for undergraduate education at NTU, commented: “Normally, they will look at other achievements that they have - whether in sports, in arts … or even if they are very passionate about community service, leadership. So these are the things that we usually look for. “We are going to encourage all the schools to broaden the criteria, to allow more people who have a very strong passion, to be given the opportunity to be interviewed. We should be more adventurous, open it a bit more and ask more questions, outside of the usual parameters, and if you find somebody who is really very interesting and very passionate … give them a chance.” NTU had evaluated 1,400 students under the scheme last year and about 600 were given a place. All three universities said that even as they exercise flexibility, it is still important for students to show that they possess the ""adequate academic competence"" to go through the rigour and demands of a university education.  - CNA/ms",13.112283073135124

Describe yourself. 2. Why do you think we should accept you? How can you contribute to NTU? 3. Did you apply in other Universities as well?Probing Questions 1. Describe yourself in 2 sentences. [Stress Test -1] 2. Describe yourself in only 3 words. [Stress Test -1] 3. Which community areas did you serve? [Probing CCAs & Interests -2] 4. Why didn't you apply for Humanities & Social Studies instead? [Probing CCAs & Interests -2] 5. Why do you still want to choose NTU instead of NUS? [Universities Choice -3] Below are just my opinions. The interview ended surprisingly faster than expected - far less than 10 minutes. However, there were no questions related to assess my competency for ACBS, and I guess that these questions are completely the same as single degree interview. Also, I doubt they even know what I actually applied for. So for those who are applying ACBS as well, do rest assure.  Comparing NTU and SMU, I find that NTU is more rigid in the way they conduct their interviews. They seem to have a list of standardized questions to be asked. Whereas for SMU, after I spoken about my attachment in one of the Big 4, the whole conversation was all about the work I did, and how I was able to cope with stress in the environment. Very friendly professors. As such, it is much easier to control your conversation topic for SMU. Again, in my opinion, NTU is more interested in how you can contribute to NTU. Whilst for SMU, the professors really want to know you as an individual. Also, the interviewers in NTU seem to be expressionless; it feels that I was talking to robots, but at the very least they did hold eye contact with me. Both are equally efficient in conducting their interviews nevertheless. Generally agree with Aomatsu.  Just to add on, I went for the ACBS interview back in 2014, because, you know, NS, and the main interviewer was Prof Valerie. We had a rather entertaining conversation and it was more of a chit-chat session than an interview. NTU knows what courses you applied for. She had my application form in hard copy on the table (in full view) and asked me why I applied for REP as my 2nd choice, and only put Accountancy (single degree) as the 3rd choice. Other than that, the main focus was definitely on how I would contribute NTU if they offered me a place/scholarship. Of course I talked about joining some clubs in NBS, my career goals and the various competitions/events at NTU which interest me. They didn't ask me those ""essay"" kind of questions though, but we chatted for around 20 minutes. It was a very light-hearted and enjoyable session and it felt really short in fact. After the interview, the prof invited me to apply for the USP. I also went for the SMU interview (also in 2014) for the double degree programme in Accountancy and Business. I remember being interviewed by Prof Seow and Prof Gary Pan. They seemed really concerned about whether I applied to NUS/NTU and asked me which I would pick if I was offered all 3. It somehow gave me the impression that they were being insecure/desperate. However, I liked the fact that they gave more attention to my hobbies and interests and focused less on academic achievements. I guess this is one example of SMU's holistic admissions process. They were also constantly marketing their school throughout the interview by asking me if I knew that their school of accountancy was ranked xxx in the BYU rankings etc, and kept comparing them to the other 2 unis. What I got out of that interview was that the profs at SMU are really passionate about what they do and that they're incredibly driven especially when it comes to building the school's reputation.  At the end of the day, both are local universities. Employers will lump NUS/NTU/SMU together anyway. So in terms of employability, no difference really. Choose the school which suits your personality better.",12.949612468495205

That doesn't negate the fact that it is unfair though. Just because you benefit from a system of unfairness doesn't mean you should be ignorant to other people's woes. Don't discredit the feelings of non-citizens when the chance of a 70rp Singaporean getting into a course is higher than a 75rp Foreigner getting into the same course. You damn well know it's not fair. Just because it's unfair doesn't mean we're going to cry in front of the Unis and beg them to change the admission system. We can't do anything about it anyway. But don't turn a blind eye and say it's fair. Recognise that you are more privileged than I am, a PR, because I myself recognise that I am more privileged than a foreigner.  Honestly I much rather hear you all condescendingly say ""sucks to be you then"" than hear you ignorantly say that it's ""not unfair""  If i said anything hurtful then I apologize that's not my intention. Like what i said, I'm very fortunate to be in Singapore. I'm really grateful that my family was welcomed here and that we now have access to better education, job, health care and much more. Just wanna to input my 2 cents here. Firstly, please do ignore the comments about serving national service. It's a poor argument considering the fact that most female doesn't really serve NS. (Some do with the volunteer corps. Pls do not start another dicussion topic here) Secondly, about your own definition of ""fairness"" is where all students compete on equal ground regardless of nationality. Well it's flaw in the sense that all university in the world practice this form of discrimination one way or another. So it's makes sense that we are fair on a global level for practising this form of discrimination too. Your definition of ""fairness"" would ruin the primary function of tertiary education which is to essentially groom young adults for singapore workforce. Logically speaking a country would much prefer to groom locally born citizens because of the simple fact that they are more likely to stay in singapore to work and live. What happens when all the newly produced workforce personnel starts disappearing one by one? Gone AF man. Secondly, the education system is subsided through all the tax they collect. The government do need to account for and answer how they spend the tax collect. Essentially the primary function of tax is to benefit singapore (Note: Not singaporean). But in this case, it is better for our country (you PR right?) if Singaporean are groomed to work in the country first. P.S This are just some of the point that may answer your post and sorta ""make you feel better..""

(TP Business, elective Human Resource & Corporate Comms)  Cgpa : 3.46 (can pull up in last sem to at least 3.5) Olvls : 11 (eng : A1, both E and A math : B3)  Very active in school, captain for a sports team, Exco for a school club. Participated in camps and what not.  Won numerous POL-ITE medals, won gold medals for national sports competitions (but not in recent years). However, not in the national team.  The courses I would want to apply for is either Comms studies/ Business in all of the unis. Choices down the line might be Hist/sociology.  1)What are the chances of DA/NAA accepting?  2)Should I apply with 5th semester's results?  3)Who are the best people I should approach for testimonials?  Admissions haven't started yet, I just wanted to know what are the best options for me now. Any friends that applied with cgpa similar to mine got into the same courses? Any advice would be very much appreciated!!  Thank you! 1. DA spots will increase to 15% next year. I can only say there are more opportunities for people like you to be able to be admitted via DA, however do note that there are a lot of people like you with the exact same circumstances. You could have a shot though 2. All poly students who applies during their third year (next Feb) will have to apply with 5sem. There isn't really much difference when applying with 5sem or with 6sem later unless your GPA falls or rises a lot more 3. For sports DAs please approach your coaches. Discounting any DA consideration, your CPGA is way off for Biz/ Comm Studies/ FASS. Sociology is pretty popular these days, there was some competition for slots this year. You can try History though",11.179181467786181

That doesn't negate the fact that it is unfair though. Just because you benefit from a system of unfairness doesn't mean you should be ignorant to other people's woes. Don't discredit the feelings of non-citizens when the chance of a 70rp Singaporean getting into a course is higher than a 75rp Foreigner getting into the same course. You damn well know it's not fair. Just because it's unfair doesn't mean we're going to cry in front of the Unis and beg them to change the admission system. We can't do anything about it anyway. But don't turn a blind eye and say it's fair. Recognise that you are more privileged than I am, a PR, because I myself recognise that I am more privileged than a foreigner.  Honestly I much rather hear you all condescendingly say ""sucks to be you then"" than hear you ignorantly say that it's ""not unfair""  If i said anything hurtful then I apologize that's not my intention. Like what i said, I'm very fortunate to be in Singapore. I'm really grateful that my family was welcomed here and that we now have access to better education, job, health care and much more.  Dear bestification, I really hope you can just stop, cus the more you say, the more ppl get annoyed. This world is fking unfair. Fact.  75rp is not a good score, as said by the fellow commenter. I am not sure which country ure from (i assume malaysia), and honestly the reason in you choosing to study in Singapore as oppose to your own country is because we have a better and more stable education system in Singapore. Singapore in comparison, do have a fair intake of foreign students on a global scale. Why don't I hear you talking about other unis in other countries? Have you even looked at the US?  Local unis rank well globally as well as having competitive costs, making it a hot spot for foreigners.  NS aside, if the unis in Malaysia are better than singapore, im pretty sure many of us will gladly flock over for our education. Also to note, singaporeans are alr angered by the huge rise in foreigners for employment, and now having to know that the govt is offering our tax payers money only to attract foreign 'talents' to study here, and have them 'MIA' or jumping to an mnc and getting the bond paid off by the company, definitely do not sit well with us. talent, refers to high aptitude; cream of the crop",11.166054263589558

Been pondering over it for a long time but still can't make up my mind.  A bit about myself : I hate projects, exams is my forte. : I am more of an introvert despite having many friends. : I specialised in marketing management in poly. : My dream course is NUS or NTU Business. Still waiting for the former (slim chance) and got rejected by the latter without interview due to my poor o lvl maths gradeSmu biz - I live near smu. - My seniors keep telling me that smu biz school ppl are bitchy and there are a lot of elitist ACJC people there. - Since I'm from marketing, continuing to study marketing in smu would be easier for me and I'm more likely to get better grades as I'm familiar with many of the modules. However, since I'm from poly and already graduated top of my marketing cohort, studying the same discipline for another 4 years (7 years in total) is an overkill and quite redundant. - SMU isn't ranked in QS (I think employers tend to favour nus/ntu grads more? And it would be harder for me to become a silver serpent? Also might be harder for me to apply for masters in a prestigious UK/US uni in future since smu is not very recognised overseas) - I hate seminar style lectures. Ntu comms - Far from my place (about 1.5h) which means I gotta stay in hall for the first year and waste a lot of time travelling for subsequent years - It's a known fact that comms students are very loud and quite bitchy too (correct me if I'm wrong) - Communications complements my diploma (marketing) and enables me to do marketing communications or digital marketing in future. Heard that wkwsci teaches a lot of technical skills such as illustrator and video editing which I feel is more helpful for my future career. - Ranking wise, very good. Wkwsci is first in Asia and 6th in the world. Ntu is also ranked 13th in the world so easier for me to apply for masters in a prestigious UK/US uni I guess. - A bit worried that I would lose out to mass comm students who have background in poly... I would pick a course with lower project weightage since exams are my forte. However, I do not know the weightage for both courses. Anyone knows? In summary, my dilemma is over the culture and ranking/reputation of the school ",11.09397189606453

I really do not understand why I need to be thankful that im born a Singaporean. What I should be thankfulis the selfless contributions of all our forefathers, who came over to a undelveloped land at an uncertain times, and they did not leave, instead they stayed to make this place better. I I am thankful to my parents for working hard and paying the taxes that led to the development of this country. I am thankful to all the Singaporean sons (myself included) that serves and brings about stability in the country which in turn bring about growth and development .  Now tell me, at which part did these foreign students that feels they should have a place over SG students fit in? At which part did their parents and forefathers fit in? It is a fact that scores of them are here on our scholarships and taking the limited places in our uni, it is a done deal and we LLST, the last thing they should do is to whine when some policies seems to favour locals over them. America once preached about its ethos of diversity and freedom, yet look at the state of the country. Racism is rampant and individualism trumps mutual understanding. I do not think this is the Singapore our forefathers want for us as well. Yes, many of us Singaporean have to thank our parents for the contribution they have made. But your comment seems to exclude naturalized citizens, who moved here 1 generation ago. Their children enjoy the privileges of being a Singapore, and does the fact that their parents aren't Singapore-born (and hence contributed little to the country) mean that they are any ""less Singaporean""? You are in the position to say all this because you have been blind to the number of privileges you have enjoyed throughout your life. How do you feel receiving the same comment should you try out for renown schools like Cambridge or Oxford? The reason you should be thankful of being born a Singaporean is for the same reason. If everyone had a choice, they would all want to be born into a rich family in a country with high standards of living. Your birth is only due to natural selection... In any case, quotas for international students and PRs are already fixed. Want to know the reason behind our high local university rankings? Do a little more research...

To deviate, the skills i find seriously lacking in some candidates today are multicultural literacy and global awareness, as well as the ability to work with people uniquely different from them.

2016,nanyang technological university|ntu|computer|com|infosys|information systems|analytics|smart city,Singapore polytechnic|singapore poly|sp,"Which university? Which course of study?Aim for a course that best suits you, rather than enrol in the most lucrative one Tan Eng Chye Prof Tan is deputy president (academic affairs) and provost at the National University of Singapore. PUBLISHED 6 HOURS AGOhttp://www.straitstimes.com/singapor...ourse-of-study The university admissions season is in full swing, and this is an exciting time for students in Singapore. The tertiary education landscape here has expanded significantly, and there are now many varied and interesting pathways for students to choose from, from traditional professional degree courses in medicine or engineering, to music and the liberal arts and science. Many parents I met at the National University of Singapore's (NUS) Open Day last month remarked that they are envious of the plethora of choices their children have, and wish to be young once more. Some of you may have secured multiple offers from different universities in Singapore and overseas, and you will have to make an acceptance decision soon. But how should one decide? Every year, the Ministry of Education publishes the employment rates and median starting salaries of fresh graduates of the different degree programmes offered by local universities. I certainly hope students do not make decisions based solely on data obtained through the Graduate Employment Survey (GES). GES data provides an indication of starting salaries. Starting salaries are but a guide; they neither set the course nor determine one's career trajectory or destiny. In this volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous or ""Vuca"" world, one cannot predict the future or where the lucrative jobs will be. You would therefore want your university education to equip you with broad-based life skills, and develop you with the flexibility and resilience needed to pick up new knowledge, adapt to new circumstances, and exploit job opportunities across a variety of sectors throughout your lifetime of careers. Another consideration is whether and how the university course adds value to your educational journey. Some students (and parents) may look to university rankings as a measure of the strength of a university department. And there are definitely synergies between research and education. If the university department excels in research, and counts world-leading researchers in the field, it is likely that cutting-edge research will filter through to your learning experience. You will have the opportunity to be taught by highly regarded academics, and there will be plenty of opportunities to conduct research under the who's-who in the field. This is particularly valuable if you have a very strong interest in research or academia. Choosing a university that excels in your area of interest may also open up more specialised opportunities, such as advanced facilities, academic opportunities such as overseas study or research trips, as well as internships and employment opportunities with prestigious organisations in the industry. Beyond academic reputation, your choice of university will also affect your life intellectually, socially and professionally. You should evaluate the entire student experience, and whether it will suit you. Find out if the social setting on campus is what you would want to be part of. NUS has, for example, the Yale-NUS College and the University Town Residential College programmes, which offer an integrated living and learning experience, amid a collegial and intellectually vibrant setting. Another distinctive programme is the NUS Overseas Colleges programme, where students get to live, work and study in an entrepreneurial hub such as Silicon Valley, New York City or Stockholm, taking entrepreneurship classes at a partner university while working in promising entrepreneurial start-ups. All universities have carefully developed their own suite of programmes and it is worth your time and effort to find out what is on offer. Talk to the professors, and to current students. Universities hold Open Days and various outreach sessions where you can visit the campus and get first-hand information. The best-ranked university or the programme that offers you two degrees in the shortest duration may sound attractive, but they may not necessarily be what you are looking for.  Some of you may want an intensely academic experience, and to pick up as many degrees in the shortest possible time. Yet others may prefer to develop a broader range of capabilities, to try out new things, or to pursue more varied experiences. You should aim to identify a university and a course that best suits you, and not simply enrol in the most competitive or lucrative course. After all, you will be spending your next three to four years in this programme. For those of you whose grades may not meet the degree programme's published entry requirements, do not give up. All local universities have discretionary admissions schemes. Last year, NUS interviewed a record 1,600 students under the scheme, and admitted 670 students. This scheme allows universities to assess applicants more holistically, and to consider their passions and attributes such as leadership, resilience or entrepreneurial skills or talent in non-academic areas. The good news is that from the next academic year onwards, NUS, Nanyang Technological University and Singapore Management University can take in more students under the Discretionary Admissions Scheme, from 10 per cent of the annual intake currently, to up to 15 per cent. This will enable more students to enter universities on the basis of their strengths and talents, beyond academic performance. There is no perfect university. What is key is to make a considered decision with the resources and information that are available to you. Your degree should help start you on the journey to where you want to go. The knowledge, experiences and opportunities in your university life should also prepare you for life beyond your degree. As a student in Singapore, you will have up to the beginning of June to decide on your offers from most of the local universities. Whatever you eventually decide on, make the most of your university experience because, for many, it will be the best time of your life.",15.252001496810045

It will be easier if you had passed all your subjects. It need not be brilliant but you got to pass it. Since you are a national athlete, go and talk to the universities student life staff and get yourself recommended in the next cycle. They will play a crucial role in recommending you to the admissions staff. Good luck!",14.274621530402474

Unfortunately I'm not able to advise you on private tuition because I haven't started looking yet, but I just want to check if you have already registered to sit as a private candidate this year? The deadline is already over, so if you haven't done so and is planning to take A levels this year, it would be best if you make a call to SEAB right now.",14.19217194697961
2016,nanyang technological university|ntu|computer|com|infosys|information systems|analytics|smart city,Singapore polytechnic|singapore poly|sp,"DISCLAIMER: I'd like to say that this post is not meant to flame anyone or put a negative spotlight on anyone. The examples I highlighted below are simply the comments/questions that I spotted which inspired me to write this. I wouldn't want to start a discussion about education in Singapore here, nor would this a debate for JC vs Poly. Just a little background about myself - I was a comms student in poly, did pretty average for my GPA (3.5x), missed the uni application in my first year of army, got rejected by NTU ADM last year, finally got a late acceptance letter from ADM this year. So trust me when I say I can empathise with those who are still waiting for their acceptance letter, and why some people are asking certain questions here.Spoiler!Hi guys, care to give your opinions and views on SMU Business VS NUS Statistics?  Which one will have higher demand by employers? The answer to this is simple, ask yourself where do you want to work? MNC? Local startup? The big 4? Starting your own business? Government sector? The 'value' of a degree is only given to by the people looking at it. Even then, there are those companies in each category that would defy the stereotypical hiring policy. So my advice to the poster who asked this question is to define who are your said 'employers' first. If you have no idea where you want to work or which sector of business you want to be in, it might serve you better to understand more about the course to see which specific programme/school/school culture might suit you better rather which degree appeals more to 'employers'. It's better to make an informed choice yourself.Spoiler!Actually, people do look at where you study. I got a couple of friends in HR. They told me that they would also look at the university, course, GPA/grades, modules taken, then any leadership roles regardless of how many years of relevant work experience a person has. Some say they tend to give more priority to old boys/girls, alum, that sort of thing. I'm not saying you're wrong here buddy, and in fact you're correct in saying this! But like I mentioned previously, it depends on where you're applying for work at, what is the company's hiring policy, what are they looking for etc. Comments like this might mislead some to think that this one degree/choice of school will make or break their future. What your friends experienced are the hiring policies of their particular companies they work at, but it's definitely not the same across various companies.There's no 'one size fits all' answer to certain questions. There is also no 'only one single path' to success. Some students don't realise it yet. This is the point that I'm driving at - Students should not be afraid to seek out multiple answers to a single question. There is always more than one way to solve a single question. Isn't that how it is for Math too? There may be one solution given in the answer book but it doesn't mean that that's the only one.If you do not get your university placing in the public schools this year, there are many other options! For poly students, you can take a gap year and work first, try again next year or the year after, like what I was planning to do myself should I not get my placing this year. Work experience ain't a bad idea too. For JC students, you can always take the A's again (like what some here are planning to do), to get a better grade for your dream course on the next application. I had a friend who couldn't get pharmaceutical, retook his A's while serving NS, scored a much better grade and went on to pharmaceutical on a scholarship in the end. If you really want to study this year, then private schools might be a viable idea as well. Yes things might not have gone according to plan for you. You might have been taught your whole life that you must get into NTU/NUS/SMU, or that might have been pressure on yourself. But fact is, if you're not getting in (even after appeal), then it's on you to take your next step forward. You have to keep moving forward in life despite the obstacles you face. If you're really rejected in the end, allow yourself to be sad for a little while, then pick yourself up, make plans, take the next step forward and move on. You might have to take a little detour, but it doesn't mean you can't get there. It's just how badly you want it. I hope this lengthy post written at 3am in the morning would encourage some of you even a little, because I know what it's like to constantly fail at every turn and have life keep pushing you down. If it did, then I'm glad. ",14.082317138851515

2016,nanyang technological university|ntu|computer|com|infosys|information systems|analytics|smart city,Singapore polytechnic|singapore poly|sp,"SINGAPORE: Three of Singapore's autonomous universities are refining the way they admit students under the Discretionary Admissions Scheme, which looks beyond a person's academic achievements. It comes as the universities prepare to take in more students under the scheme, when the current cap of 10 per cent allowed for discretionary admissions goes up to 15 per cent next year. ADVERTISING inRead invented by Teads National University of Singapore (NUS) is offering 7,000 places for the coming academic year, but it has received four times the number of applicants. While it has started handing out offers to those who made the cut based on their grades, about 1,800 students who did not are undergoing interviews to be considered for discretionary admissions this year. NUS has been evaluating and admitting more students under the scheme over the years. Last year, it evaluated 1,600 students, 400 more than 2014. 670 of them got in, 70 more than 2014. With more students expected to be considered for discretionary admissions, the process at NUS may be refined. Said Professor Tan Eng Chye, deputy president of academic affairs at NUS: “We are evolving; for instance, we have gotten alumni to help us with the interviews. I find that very useful because the alumni have a lot of experience in sizing up people and candidates, and they ask very useful questions. “We also provide more data on what to look out for and if the numbers get to be big, we may decide that maybe we can have sort of a test first - not an academic test per se, but perhaps a test to look at other non-academic aspects of that person. It could be an aptitude test.” Prof Tan added: “Exercising flexibility is one aspect; you also have to be fairly sharp on what to look for - it is not simply: 'OK, meet the numbers.' Our interest is to look for attributes of the applicants that would make the student community more interesting, more diversified, and enhance the interaction within the student community. “Those who can adequately and can eloquently convey their passions and interests - that would be advantageous. But we also have to look out for students who may not be able to communicate as well, but yet they have the potential for us to groom them to be able graduates.” At the Singapore Management University (SMU), discretionary admissions currently form about 5 to 8 per cent of the annual intake. With the higher cap of 15 per cent for such admissions next year, the university will have ""more leeway"" when assessing students. Professor Pang Yang Hoong, vice provost for undergraduate matters and student development at SMU, said: “For SMU, looking at students with other qualifications is not something terribly new because we always been holistic in the way we assess students and their suitability for admission. We will be more flexible. “(We look for) passion, the aptitude for the course for which we are admitting them into. It would also be ideal if students have demonstrated that they are successful to be in time management, that they also possess resilience and the ability to overcome difficult situations. This will help us to assess if that person has got the resilience and the determination to do well in the programme.” SMU is expecting more polytechnic graduates to apply through the discretionary route with the cap being raised to 15 per cent of the annual intake. Nanyang Technological University (NTU) will also ""broaden the criteria"", to give more people a shot at securing a place. It will favourably consider those who possess ""enthusiasm and relevant work experience"". Professor Kam Chan Hin, senior associate provost for undergraduate education at NTU, commented: “Normally, they will look at other achievements that they have - whether in sports, in arts … or even if they are very passionate about community service, leadership. So these are the things that we usually look for. “We are going to encourage all the schools to broaden the criteria, to allow more people who have a very strong passion, to be given the opportunity to be interviewed. We should be more adventurous, open it a bit more and ask more questions, outside of the usual parameters, and if you find somebody who is really very interesting and very passionate … give them a chance.” NTU had evaluated 1,400 students under the scheme last year and about 600 were given a place. All three universities said that even as they exercise flexibility, it is still important for students to show that they possess the ""adequate academic competence"" to go through the rigour and demands of a university education.  - CNA/ms",13.314307738794357

I don't think wadsad or any of us knew of your personal circumstances. No matter how Singapore is said to be a meritocracy, the State still has to take care of its citizens first. Otherwise the government of the day can forget about surviving its next elections. Hence, SCs are by and large prioritised for admission over SPRs and international students. The fact is that SPRs (most, not all since there are stateless PRs around) and foreigners still owe their allegiance to their home countries.  It may be a flaw to you, but the system cannot assume nor decide which SPR applicant is going to stay or who is not. So it needs to apply the same standards throughout to keep it fair for every single SPR applying to the university. System discipline, if you've heard of the term. No hard feelings anyways. Wishing you all the best for your citizenship application when the time comes! actually, singapore is never crystal clear on the migration guidelines for applicants to be citizen. and alot of high flyer sinkies had to leave singapore becos their spouse is unable to be singapore citizen or even be PR. And there are also spouses who stayed >20 years working under a pass and not get PR.  and yes generally singaporeans are very ignorant until the day they decide to work n live in overseas for 3-5 years. and then they will ""wake up"" FYI for hitomi, there is a risk assessment table or formula of somesort they dun release to public. shall not go into any details on my speculation on what the factors may be. i wish u luck in ur future in whatever path u decide. =)",12.024809356950673

I have been lurking around here for quite some time and have a burning question to ask. From what I have read, NTU/NUS/SMU all have Bell Curve grading which means it is not about whether you get 50/100 or 90/100, but instead how you rank as compared to your cohort. If you rank #1 you get A+, and if you rank near the bottom you get C or D.  Even if you get 90/100, if your level position turns out to be at the bottom, that score will still get you a low grade. But conversely, even if you get 60/100, you could end up at the top with a good grade.  This concept both excites and frightens me at the same time.  Now my question is based on this observation that everyone is talking about the 10th percentile of the IGP, which is the bottom 10%. To be a bit more blunt, these are the people who rank at the bottom and barely made it in.  So even if I am near the 10th percentile IGP, doesn't this just means I am part of the bottom 10% of the people who made it in, and hence quite likely to be on the extreme left side of the bell curve? Won't I just be scoring Cs & Ds if things remain constant? I have already been trying my best up till now. Really worried about stepping into an environment where I am the bottom 10%. Even if I work super hard, it's quite hard to imagine I can jump from bottom 10% to say the top 50%, especially since everyone else will definitely be working very hard too.  Or am I talking myself into believing university is more competitive than it actually is? I would head down to the open houses and and speak to the seniors there directly, but do note the seniors you speaks to may be isolated case in the bell curve too, since they say ""you are shaped by who you hangs out with most"". A lot of young people from developed countries are well fed with vital information, myself included, had along the way barely need to explore in-depth into what shaped us, when was the last time you actually spend tremendous effort to say 'hello'? 'Hello' is a basic social gesture, and it comes in many form, and it is safe to say that the idea of 'hello' had been shaped by our ""hang out with the most"" (caretakers/parents) when we were young. In the same way, is there something you have been experiencing that had been shaping you in this unprecedented worries? People pulling you down? Makes you doubt your own abilities? If so I urge you to identify the sources of your worries within deeper segment of your own life, and address the problem with facts and testimonies.

This year, I applied for NTU and placed EEE as my first choice but got rejected. I appealed for MSE and also got rejected. It was really disappointing. I wrote in an email to the admission office but their reply to me was my situation would be reviewed with the rest of appeal cases.  Has anyone ever encountered or heard about this kind of situation before? Hope I am not the only one who is facing this...  Good luck to all those who are re-appealing into their desired courses!

(10th percentile was 3.78ish i think?)  as mentioned in a straits time article a couple of years ago, SG government is trying to encourage poly grads to start working instead of furthering studies.  'PM Lee, who addressed polytechnic students recently, told them that getting a degree was not the only option. He encouraged them to work for a few years or start their own business. ""You will gain experience and understand yourself better and then be better able to decide what the next step will be,"" he said at Ngee Ann Polytechnic's 50th-anniversary celebrations. A day later, National Development Minister Khaw Boon Wan had similar advice.'  Yupp this is very true. Starting from this year, polytechnics have been introducing those programmes to encourage poly students to work such as Skillsfuture, Earn and learn program etc. I also remember everyone being made to do a MOE survey on whether or not we think having a degree is important. This is damn unfortunate la. Our batch not only have to compete with the best A lvl batch in 10 years but also fight for the reduced no. of spots  My seniors last year had it easy, they got into business with only 3.7+.

None of the poly people I know scored lower than a B3 (safe gauge, although the people I know all scored A1s and A2s) for their O level English. Moreover, all poly students in soci are required to take an essay examination and undergo an interview before being offered.

All the best for the UniSIM interview though! Mind sharing which course were you shortlisted for? I applied with Social Work as my first choice but got rejected by them quite quickly, probably oversubscribed or something.  From what I know some of the SIM GE partners like SIM-UB award an actual degree from UB itself  so there might be some perceived value in that - pay a bit more but be a full student of a US university. Whereas others like SIM-UOL awards a UOL international programmes (i.e. distance learning) degree. Personally I also applied to SIM-UOL's BSc International Relations (declined the offer though); it would probably be cheaper than the local universities overall and I'd have been able to graduate in 3 years instead of the norm 4. The value in studying from an overseas uni comes from the exposure you get by being located physically overseas..I hope you don't think that just because it's awarded by an overseas uni that employers are going to prefer you vs a distance learning UOL graduate",9.30919364986273

To deviate, the skills i find seriously lacking in some candidates today are multicultural literacy and global awareness, as well as the ability to work with people uniquely different from them.

2016,nanyang technological university|ntu|computer|com|infosys|information systems|analytics|smart city,temasek polytechnic|temasek poly|tp,"Which university? Which course of study?Aim for a course that best suits you, rather than enrol in the most lucrative one Tan Eng Chye Prof Tan is deputy president (academic affairs) and provost at the National University of Singapore. PUBLISHED 6 HOURS AGOhttp://www.straitstimes.com/singapor...ourse-of-study The university admissions season is in full swing, and this is an exciting time for students in Singapore. The tertiary education landscape here has expanded significantly, and there are now many varied and interesting pathways for students to choose from, from traditional professional degree courses in medicine or engineering, to music and the liberal arts and science. Many parents I met at the National University of Singapore's (NUS) Open Day last month remarked that they are envious of the plethora of choices their children have, and wish to be young once more. Some of you may have secured multiple offers from different universities in Singapore and overseas, and you will have to make an acceptance decision soon. But how should one decide? Every year, the Ministry of Education publishes the employment rates and median starting salaries of fresh graduates of the different degree programmes offered by local universities. I certainly hope students do not make decisions based solely on data obtained through the Graduate Employment Survey (GES). GES data provides an indication of starting salaries. Starting salaries are but a guide; they neither set the course nor determine one's career trajectory or destiny. In this volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous or ""Vuca"" world, one cannot predict the future or where the lucrative jobs will be. You would therefore want your university education to equip you with broad-based life skills, and develop you with the flexibility and resilience needed to pick up new knowledge, adapt to new circumstances, and exploit job opportunities across a variety of sectors throughout your lifetime of careers. Another consideration is whether and how the university course adds value to your educational journey. Some students (and parents) may look to university rankings as a measure of the strength of a university department. And there are definitely synergies between research and education. If the university department excels in research, and counts world-leading researchers in the field, it is likely that cutting-edge research will filter through to your learning experience. You will have the opportunity to be taught by highly regarded academics, and there will be plenty of opportunities to conduct research under the who's-who in the field. This is particularly valuable if you have a very strong interest in research or academia. Choosing a university that excels in your area of interest may also open up more specialised opportunities, such as advanced facilities, academic opportunities such as overseas study or research trips, as well as internships and employment opportunities with prestigious organisations in the industry. Beyond academic reputation, your choice of university will also affect your life intellectually, socially and professionally. You should evaluate the entire student experience, and whether it will suit you. Find out if the social setting on campus is what you would want to be part of. NUS has, for example, the Yale-NUS College and the University Town Residential College programmes, which offer an integrated living and learning experience, amid a collegial and intellectually vibrant setting. Another distinctive programme is the NUS Overseas Colleges programme, where students get to live, work and study in an entrepreneurial hub such as Silicon Valley, New York City or Stockholm, taking entrepreneurship classes at a partner university while working in promising entrepreneurial start-ups. All universities have carefully developed their own suite of programmes and it is worth your time and effort to find out what is on offer. Talk to the professors, and to current students. Universities hold Open Days and various outreach sessions where you can visit the campus and get first-hand information. The best-ranked university or the programme that offers you two degrees in the shortest duration may sound attractive, but they may not necessarily be what you are looking for.  Some of you may want an intensely academic experience, and to pick up as many degrees in the shortest possible time. Yet others may prefer to develop a broader range of capabilities, to try out new things, or to pursue more varied experiences. You should aim to identify a university and a course that best suits you, and not simply enrol in the most competitive or lucrative course. After all, you will be spending your next three to four years in this programme. For those of you whose grades may not meet the degree programme's published entry requirements, do not give up. All local universities have discretionary admissions schemes. Last year, NUS interviewed a record 1,600 students under the scheme, and admitted 670 students. This scheme allows universities to assess applicants more holistically, and to consider their passions and attributes such as leadership, resilience or entrepreneurial skills or talent in non-academic areas. The good news is that from the next academic year onwards, NUS, Nanyang Technological University and Singapore Management University can take in more students under the Discretionary Admissions Scheme, from 10 per cent of the annual intake currently, to up to 15 per cent. This will enable more students to enter universities on the basis of their strengths and talents, beyond academic performance. There is no perfect university. What is key is to make a considered decision with the resources and information that are available to you. Your degree should help start you on the journey to where you want to go. The knowledge, experiences and opportunities in your university life should also prepare you for life beyond your degree. As a student in Singapore, you will have up to the beginning of June to decide on your offers from most of the local universities. Whatever you eventually decide on, make the most of your university experience because, for many, it will be the best time of your life.",15.07908973635064

Undergraduate intake for international students are more or less 20%. And they are moving towards reducing international students intake to 15% in the future, in concurrent with another movement to incrementally increase the local intake towards 40% of the cohort. If you are talking about the population of international students at any given time, then it is definitely more than 20%, due to the movement of students globally across universities. There are no dumping grounds in our universities, each faculties have their own industry and merits. But of course, if these faculties don't innovate with the times and keep a close relationship with the industry players, they will be left behind. Your use of the employment rates to determine dumping ground is flawed, there is a difference in the future prospects and individual choices between professional degrees and academic degrees. There will be a percentage of students from these academic degrees moving on to post-graduate programmes to deepen their knowledge and research in their respective fields, some will also move on to NIE or IAL, so they may teach or formulate curriculum at a higher level, beyond primary and secondary. Some international students may apply for MOE tuition grants, in return these students will have to work in a singapore company and contribute to our economy. These students working as foreigners will also be paying higher taxes than locals, which in turn translates into money to spend in national programmes. And providing Education is one of the ways, Singapore build her soft power globally.

SMU received 1,108 applications for the 45 places in the course, which means about 25 students are vying for every place. The demand for the new course has also led to a rise in total number of applications - 14,000 in all this year, a 6 per cent rise over last year. Earlier this year, when SMU announced the new course, its officials likened it to Oxford University's prestigious politics, philosophy and economics course. It is aimed at giving students a broad understanding of how the world works and will prepare them for a range of careers. Students who had applied for the course said it is an unusual combination since it includes the study of law with economics and politics - and prestigious to boot as it is being offered to only a select group of high-calibre students. Many were also drawn by the fact that the course would prepare them for a wide range of jobs, including in journalism, foreign affairs, public service, consulting and research. SMU provost Lily Kong said she was delighted with the response. She added: ""From all our engagement sessions, it is clear that students, parents and employers recognise the value that the PLE combination of disciplines can bring in preparing graduates who can handle multifaceted careers... ""Through a deeper understanding of how politics, law and economics intersect to shape the world in which we live, we hope to groom a new generation of leaders and thinkers for Singapore."" The 45 students selected for the course will take all three subjects in the first year, before specialising in one of four areas - global studies, distribution and justice, public policy and governance, or choice and behaviour - from year two. Students will also have to go on a 10-week internship during which they will work on a project to find solutions to a real-world problem. SMU said several firms have indicated their interest in offering internships to those on the course. They include the Economic Development Board as well as consultancies like Bain and Company. SMU officials said close to 5,000 of the 14,000 applicants have been shortlisted so far. They will be further assessed via interviews. Professor Kong said that, besides academic results, SMU uses other criteria for admission. ""Exam grades are a valid measure, but they cannot be the sole measure of a student's ability."" The university is the first in Singapore to require all [shortlisted] candidates to attend an interview. It started the practice 16 years ago, when 2,000 students applied to become part of its pioneer batch. Interviews are still required now, although the number of candidates shortlisted for the six undergraduate degree courses has trebled. They are conducted individually or in groups, with professors on the lookout for intellectual curiosity and leadership qualities. SMU said a select group of students - about 1,000 - with strong academic and other abilities were invited to visit the university on ""SMU Discovery Day"" this year. Prof Kong said: ""Our engagement is directed at confirming that they are indeed an excellent match for the education that SMU offers, and for them to confirm that SMU is the university of choice for them."" A-level holder Benedict Lim, 20, who applied for the PLE course, said: ""I have an interest in both (law and economics) and had a hard time picking one, so when I heard about SMU's new course, I jumped at the chance."" He is keen on a broad-based education as he believes it will train him to be versatile and adaptable and enable him to switch careers.

That's why it is best to have a broad-based education, so that you have a broad understanding of issues and how the world works.""

The universities simply don't have the capacity nor time to interview every single applicant.

I think it's unfair for these people to get in while people with decent grades and are passionate about getting into that specific course do not. Yea.. see this even in this thread. People just accept a course they have little interest or passion in for the sake of getting a university degree. The place would probably be better off given to another candidate with slightly poorer grades but a better attitude. But passion isn't something easily measured - meritocracy is a model that still works despite its flaws.

It is frustrating to see Singaporeans get into courses I want when they have such worse grades compared to mine. I can see where you're coming from, and definitely agree that seeing someone with worse grades than yourself get something you failed to is upsetting, and against the spirit of meritocracy.  But a country... gotta prioritize and look after its own citizens right? What if we remove the quota, open the floodgates, and top A level or SATs scorers from across the world flood our universities that local students can't even get in?

He just has higher expectations than the general populace when it comes to retaking A levels. Yes,he might not have gotten crappy results,but I can offer an alternative side of the story since I known him during my JC days. During my JC days,I didn't know louie till J2,when my friend invited him over to join us for a game of badminton on a Saturday in our JC. Back then, I only knew louie as being one of the best in maths/chem in my JC and he did well for that in his first A levels,so I was amazed that he was considering of retaking A's  with his results during NS(1yr my senior). He later,told me that he wasn't satisfied with his A levels results,as he hopes to get into pharmacy in NUS.  I lost contact with him,till I finished NS and I was surprised to learn that he took a gap yr after his NS,to volunteer in hospitals and also retake the A levels. I guess at this point of time,girls should be able to empathise with him at the very least,since he went through an extra yr after NS to re-do his A's. In fact,he told me his plans to re-take As this yr,but I advised him not to and to apply for university instead,since it's counter-intuitive to not go into uni,given his financial circumstances.(He can't consider overseas) Though he didn't get to pharmacy(I guess it's pharmacy's loss to not accept him), he got into nanyang scholarship programme,after all the efforts invested. I feel it's a valiant effort,coming from someone who didn't have any tuition,academic guidance during his period of retakes and still managed to make unconventional decisions(that might not seem logical to the majority) that guaranteed his success. Don't judge the book by it's cover,is all I have to say,to anyone who doubts that he doesn't experience emotional pain after each admission cycle. Emotional pain after each admission cycle? This is weird, anyone who did worse than him is suffering worse than him during the admission cycle. He did well to qualify for 95% of the courses in local university, but he is just being bent on getting into Pharmacy.  What Eddie previously meant that Louie was not the most suited person to share his experience about a success story from past failures. An example of a ''real success story'' would be middleofnowhere. He has already been performing extremely well in school, as well in A Levels. But in terms of providing advice to students who are retaking A levels (because they have failed), he will not be able to provide helpful advice. It is not a loss that Pharmacy did not accept him, but he did not fulfil the requirements set by the administration. You mentioned it as a courageous effort of him to retake A levels countless of time despite his financial difficulties, no tuition, etc. But, bear in mind, is he can choose not to retake A levels 4 times and enter Uni straight after NS, but he chose not to. He chose merely because he is obsessed into getting the course he wished to enter. Frankly speaking, from your entire paragraph, what are you trying to conclude? You kept harping on the fact that he retook A levels as if he has no choice, difficult economic situations, people must empathise him, he is really bold in making such decisions, etc.. But, you must not be biased in your opinions just because he is your classmate. I mean, also do clarify what emotional pain that he has to undergo? Being not able to enter Pharmacy, despite having tons of other choices waiting for him to choose from? There are many people out there with so little options to choose from, their emotional pain is far much worse than what he is facing.. Nevertheless, it is great that he finally resigned to his fate and know that he has a slim chance into entering Pharmacy. He should have done that 2 years back, and not clinging on to the hope that he can enter Pharmacy one day. If he had entered any course 2 years back, he can graduate earlier and support his family earlier.",12.803365286518517

While I think the PBL-pedagogy is great I would prefer something old school perhaps like at SP, NYP or maybe even NP. I would be okay with joining any of their generalised Business Diplomas, but because my lecturers here at ITE have been telling me to go to RP supposedly (""for increased chances to get top student and go to Uni"") hence that was where I was going with my original question on RP students who are mainly from R48, R52- what were their odds on advancing to University. Ultimately, I do not want to jeopardise my chances of getting to Uni if I go to RP, because I think even tho there are some benefits about PBL- the Big3 Unis still have some doubts & stigma about the learning style there at RP. At least that's what I heard when I talked to my lecturers.  Idk about you but I feel RP's Business or ""Management"" courses feels really lackluster in terms of what they cover unlike other Polys which offer dual specialisation options. Some of these which one can maybe even use in Uni? I would love to hear your thoughts. Thanks for the reply! I am from that prestigious poly with a motto in Malay ""Berkhidmat dengan Keahlian"". Lots of hype, smoke and mirror ... despite my academic excellence there. Still, I really believe that I am disadvantaged in life without PBL.  With regards to your concern, just concentrate on getting into a poly from ITE and let time dictate the outcome towards university. After all, it really ""is the singer not the song"". Meaning that if you excel in whatever you put your heart and mind to, the place you did it doesn't matter. Nothing can block your progress. You will then be positioned to do what you want to do. Not what you need to do. Like so many poor souls in this forum.  Be in the position where all university invites you to apply for priority (aka early) admission and lay out the 'red carpets' of talks, open house, individualised chats with professors, private group tours of labs, scholarship offers, etc. Be flagged by their admission scouts. Be sought after to add shine to their institutions. Win win. Got it?  Above all, be good to your parents. May you be well and happy. Amituofo",12.536572735713767

What she is trying to say is that the entire admissions process, even with the grades required, is skewed towards the JC kids.  Some examples: 1) Poly application window is in Feb, basically when we are busiest with our last projects in poly life (poly kids will know this as hell week), we still have to complete our application. I am not sure if it applies to every JC, but I know some JC provide guidance to their students in writing their personal statement if required. Poly - I tried to ask for help, but no one could help me lol. I even went for further ed/career guidance counselling but it seems that I know the facts and the competitiveness better than the counselor. So yes, poly is expecting poly kids to go out and work after poly. (But let's be honest - so many of us still want to move onto uni, public or private) JC kids - you all basically on holiday when expected to make an application.  2) As she mentioned - Open House AFTER our application. When I was NUS' Open Day, I went to the admissions booth to ask about something and there was an Indian father with his son from IB, also asking why is the Open House after their application. Yeah, you could say that we can still find out information on our own, call NUS to ask them about their programs if we are interested etc but aren't we just as much of an applicant and prospective student as the JC kids are... But truth is that they are still looking to recruit JC kids that's why the Open Day is so conveniently dated after their A'Level results are released. (P.S.: IB even earlier, apply in Jan) 3) Considering us based on 4 or 5 sems - NTU considered only my 4-semesters worth of results when making an offer as I could only submit 4-sems at the point of application. I am now appealing to my first choice but as all of us here know, chances are very slim. So my question is - why can't they hold onto their decisions and decide with my full cert? My final sem results literally is my entire year 3 modules because 5th sem roll over to the final sem due to FYP judging. Their explanation is for those with 5 sems, usually not much of a diff by the time 6th sem come, which I agree to some extent, but I believe if the student manage to pull up his grades enough to qualify him for the course he wants, it is doing disservice to his efforts. It is like making a decision based on your prelim results for A'Level kids. I am not complaining about how the odds are against us to begin with. I am just asking for the universities to see all applicants as equal, and given an equally fair shot at being considered. Sorry for the long wall of text - I just want to give you guys some context, which I don't think JC kids would know if not.

GPA 3.4? 3.5? to safely secure a place. 3.4/3.5 should be manageable if you don't slack off too much and put in effort for your assignment/projects, and study for your exams.)) Can understand the point you are trying to convey but the problem right now is that, no offence like what the person stated earlier, you guys go to poly for a diploma degree. For jc students, we went jc for a piece of a level cert in which its main purpose is to bring us to uni. No offence but poly kids are indeed ""expected"" to work after graduation. Otherwise,why go to poly when you can go jc,work ur ass off to go uni? On top of that, a level cert is ""****"" compared to a diploma cert. If you ask to be evaluated fairly, then isnt this a death sentence to alot of jc students considering sg is already so small with limited universities? Where does an a lvl cert bring you? Nowhere,cant even find a proper job that can remotely support your financial needs. Not trying to rebute you harshly.you do make sense. Just that if you look the other way, i think that it is fair to prioritise jc students over poly students.",12.185936057812961

2017,nanyang technological university|ntu|computer|com|infosys|information systems|analytics|smart city,Republic Polytechnic|Republic poly|rp,"Thanks for the reply! I'm actually currently an ITE (going to be graduating soon) student that's looking on to which polytechnics I should advance on and then subsequently, I intend on going to Uni to do a degree. While I think the PBL-pedagogy is great I would prefer something old school perhaps like at SP, NYP or maybe even NP. I would be okay with joining any of their generalised Business Diplomas, but because my lecturers here at ITE have been telling me to go to RP supposedly (""for increased chances to get top student and go to Uni"") hence that was where I was going with my original question on RP students who are mainly from R48, R52- what were their odds on advancing to University. Ultimately, I do not want to jeopardise my chances of getting to Uni if I go to RP, because I think even tho there are some benefits about PBL- the Big3 Unis still have some doubts & stigma about the learning style there at RP. At least that's what I heard when I talked to my lecturers.  Idk about you but I feel RP's Business or ""Management"" courses feels really lackluster in terms of what they cover unlike other Polys which offer dual specialisation options. Some of these which one can maybe even use in Uni? I would love to hear your thoughts. Thanks for the reply!Plow98 wrote:  I have acquaintances in NUS and SMU Business schools who graduated from RP diplomas (R48 and R52).

Instead, he now partnered another RP School of Management and Communication graduate to run a chain of 5 Mince Meat Noodle stalls at heartland kopitiams. Looks successful by the long self-service queues of hungry customers. Ha Ha. If you are RP, then you are lucky to be PBL trained. You are skilled in resolving real world problems.

But there are factors that may make an NP/SP candidate more attractive to universities. 1) SP/NP are harder to get into compared to RP. No need to debate, just look at the entry scores for the same course.  2) Grading in RP more subjective than NP/SP. Due to its non-traditional assessment methods, a lot of grading is done somewhat arbitrarily by the facilitator. Get marks for asking questions in class...thanks... 3) PBL-approach is questionable. While sounding good in theory, PBL can only be applied in limited circumstances. Why? It only works if all participants have decent knowledge of the topic at hand. Putting random people together and asking them to solve a problem just doesn't cut it. Not at a level where participants only have 'O' Level knowledge. 4) SP/NP prepares its students better for a university education. Due to its traditional teaching methods, SP/NP students will be more prepared to enter university. They have good grounding in key concepts. University business courses do have some ""PBL-related"" assignments, but they are done in conjunction with traditional teaching. First year is definitely spent on fundamentals. Summary: I am not anti-RP per se. But the school has hyped itself to have a revolutionary teaching method. Does it work? Do RP grads perform better than SP/NP grads at work? Maybe, maybe not. From what I see at least, the RP grads who did well in uni, actually spent the most time getting their basics right. They knew it was a different ballgame from RP, and they were prepared to put in the effort to sit down and learn.  They knew that uni was not going to be a place where you can spend all your time googling for answers, discussing them, and then presenting them. In uni, if you do not understand the concept well, you are out. How are you going to climb down from your lofty position, should MOE decides to implement PBL in more or all polytechnics or IHLs in Singapore?  Why are the stream of PBL experts from USA, Australia and the Scandinavian countries invited to Singapore since early this year ? A big guy from MOE stopped a recent argument by telling me that Stanford University (California, USA) uses PBL and that numerous medical schools do the same.  BTW, since secondary school moi and my friends have been googling for all information in order to answer / address our doubts or school work. In this day and age, it is the most efficient and effective method to acquire knowledge (apart from the library). In this regard, those RP guys googling away are just normal ?  Or are we weird ?  it is sad but I seldom open a book to check for information nowadays. My bad ?Amituofo",11.543514775015637

To you it may not be so, but it is pretty obvious to others in this thread that the debate you had with renshi is definitely in a way, not civil.

The same advice applies to everyone in this thread.Case closed.call ppl name i understand, but y call course dumping ground got problem? a course is called dumping ground when it has the largest population, and aside from those actually interested in the course, also accepts the lowest few ppl, whos grades dont meet the mark for the course of their choice.  dumping ground courses exist in all faculties.  also, in prev post, i was merely asking why he got accepted to smu(which i believe was quite hard to get in from my time) but not a dumping ground engineering course in ntu.  and incase you dont understand the meaning of matriculation. pretty sure applying bank loans dont fall under the following description, since its a contract/agreement between the student and the bank.http://www.ntu.edu.sg/Students/Under...s/default.aspxQuote:Matriculation Matriculation is a formal process where a person registers for study at the University and thus becomes a member of the University student community. All students enrolling in NTU academic programmes that lead to the award of a degree must matriculate with the University before commencing their studies. A person's status as a matriculated student will cease when he completes his study and is conferred his degree, or if he opts to withdraw from his study, or when his candidature is terminated by the University.

The jury is out regarding the comparability of your ""reputed"" qualifications with the Cambridge A levels and whether your superior Biology score will take precedence over your Physics score. One can only presume a good admissions process to consider all facets of a candidate, not cherry picking only the scores which put said candidate in the best possible light. As a side point, I would like to add that the admission of a permanent resident into the Dentistry course is unheard of -- at least in my circle. For the Medicine course I believe there are but a handful of PRs every cohort (3-5). If this ratio is anything to go by, go figure for Dentistry. One pointer though, please do not parade your Mensa membership as though as it were a feather in your cap worthy of excessive display. Doubtless, entry into this select group is contingent upon your god-given faculties, however it in no way displays your conviction, perservance or aptitude for a dentistry course beyond the fact that you are able to make two and two of a logical problem with greater ease than your non-Mensa brethren.

Actually I have been reading the past few years' threads as well only to realise how I must really buck up on my GPA and thanks to the realisation of how difficult it is to get into uni, I eventually managed to pull up my grades, with lots of stress of course.  Would like to contribute what I can:  Local, CPGA 3.64, 4 sem GPA 3.53, LIR4 10? or 12? Can't really remember.  Applied to:  NUS FASS - application STILL processing NTU HSS - offered third choice Linguistics based on 4 sems, will appeal for PPGA or Sociology  SMU Social Science - application STILL processing  For those wondering, I could only apply with my 4 semesters as my internship was on my 5th semester, so no 5th sem results. For NUS and SMU, they have made it clear to me at the many times I asked that they will not be making a decision based on 4 semesters if I don't meet the cut-off and will wait for the full transcript. As for NTU, their policy is to process with 4 semesters anyway and will make decision based on it.  Thankfully, my 4-semesters GPA somehow got me an interview with Linguistics. I was called up in early April, went for the writing test and interview, and got offered 2 days after my interview. When I went, two girls I spoke to both did not put Linguistics as their first choice. I believe most in the room (about 7 of us) possibly also did not do so and they were processing applications pushed down from other courses.  Just like to ask a few things I didn't see answers for despite stalking this thread quite religiously:  1) Those who got rejected - you guys got explicit rejection letters via email?  2) Those who got FASS interview and writing test - may I know what is it about? I am still hoping to DA into FASS but up till now no calls, pretty much nothing.  3) For the NTU appeal, should I write about how I have improved a lot and actually qualify for both PPGA and Soci with my 6-sems or focus on why I want to tranfer into these courses instead? Also, do you appeal specifically into one course or do they just assume you are appealing for whatever courses you didn't get?  4) Anyone applied for CAPT and have gone for the interview already?  As for DA: I did not have a CCA in school but I actively volunteered outside of school and did take on one very big role in one of the biggest community events in SG. Its way above the average amount that students would volunteer so I am hopeful yet at the same time not expectant. Have not seen a case of someone admitted via DA for community service.  I do think that my application remains processing for both NUS and SMU due to the fact that I am very borderline plus my DA is via community service. They have much better applicants to offer to but I am just praying very hard that at the end of this waiting game is good news.  Some other info that may help:  SMU is appearing to be very generous with their Biz Ad interviews this year as I know 3 people with GPAs ranging from 3.5-3.6 being offered interviews, aka already one step in if they don't screw up the interview. Could help that they come from related courses but I hope this give others in the same shoe some hope! No news is good news!  Cheers everybody! I like the positive vibes going on for the NTU appeals. Hope everybody eventually get to where they belong! ",13.407572412373483

By Mr. Davidktw.  23/03/2012. ================================================= Both NTU and NUS Computing is Good if you are a good student. I don't believe in any local university offer particularly better courses. I graduated from NUS SOC and is a Senior Consultant in a local IT firm on web applications and security deployments. I also full time *nix user from Linux to Mac to Hp UX to Solaris. I don't believe NUS Computer Engineering students are any better or worse, but I do agree their courses are designed to gear towards a different sector in computing such as embedding systems and silicon design from Intel, AMD etc and semiconductors fabrication. But nothing is stopping them from taking more SoC 3rd/$th year modules. Same goes for SoC, you can also opt for engineer modules like I took a year 1 module from mechanical engineer and it still benefit me today even though my work doesn't rely on it. I do Arduino programming and also Solidworks design for my friend. So don't be mistaken that anyone tell you that it is better in any local university. That's my opinion. How much you can benefit from the lectures and tutorial is up to your own initiative. If you are passionate about Computing, then you will be interested to learn more even without lecturers and tutors. The courses merely scratches the surface on the relevant discipline, your work is to do your own research and be passionate about what you want to achieve in the near future. Find something you are good in and improve on that aspect. Google is your good friend, relevant forums is your playground, and tertiary university is your incubator. With 3/4 years there, learn what is taught and venture on your own to go in-depth. Get yourself those internship available to get a taste of the industry standard. These are not taught in universities and only through training on the job. If you want to set a good impression in among your future boss, show that you can be independent and doesn't need spoon feeding. They won't assume you know everything, but they will assume you know what is taught in your university. Get to know some of your seniors and communicate with them as and when possible to have them give you glimpse into what they encounter outside before you do. It will give you good gauge on what to expect in the near future. Everyday the industry expectation is changing, today is Java, tomorrow is Ruby, Python and other emerging languages and technologies. Technology is going real fast, so if you are not street smart enough, you are no better than others around you, then what is your advantages to get employed when going for interviews. These are my 2 cents worth for your consideration. Absorb at your disposal. Cheers. ",13.13488572660112

I got As in GP, 4H2s and O level HCL, with B in PW. I have been considering applying for a science course in either NUS or NTU ,such as chemistry,pharmacy,life sciences etc.  1) Medicine? I ruled out medicine as I thought it's out of the question, as I didn't expect to get nearly straight As + my lack of good CCA records &consistent CIP. However, seeing my results, my mum asked me to try for medicine, saying that I might have chance of getting in. I could only apply to NUS since I didn't take the BMAT for NTU. The main question would be of course:whether I have a passion in serving as a doctor.  To be honest, I don't really have a clear idea. I enjoyed learning the various body systems and diseases in Sec 4 Bio but have never seriously considered to enter medicine. My interest in Bio is reduced in JC as we started learning micro things instead of the human body.  Qn: What do medicine students really study? Would it be back to Sec4 Bio kind of syllabus but of higher level? I joined Red Cross as a CCA in JC because I don't really have other choices and I was slightly interested in the various first aid equipment like which is used to treat what. Throughout the 1.5 years, I've only volunteered a few times outside of school as a first aider(as I was struggling with JC academically). Seeing other fellow passionate first aiders I was inspired by their commitment. I also learnt the joy of serving as the casualty thanked me after I helped them bandage their wounds. However, I also discovered a problem with myself, that is I'm afraid to talk with strangers, let alone offering support/comfort for the casualty,using words. Although I care about them, I don't dare to show it. I have no idea why I have grown into such a shy person <- this is what I heard from quite a few people.  My other concern would be my mediocre CCA record, which is quite important to enter medicine apart from grades right? I have no CCA positions throughout my life and also no stellar CIP records(as I mentioned-have to keep mugging in jc). I don't think I still have chance for medicine =_= Actually I have applied for two attachments to hospitals so as to enrich my experience in the healthcare sector and also beef up my record, sadly both were rejected,one by JC and one by RMG. Through this experience, I'm convinced that I wouldn't fit as a doctor, so I stopped considering medicine. Besides, I'm also worried about the stress of being a medical student and subsequently as a doctor. I have experienced various weird symptoms in my body due to stress since secondary school. From bruxism leading to Temporomandibular Joint Disorders and sensitive teeth, stomachache before exams, to pimple outbreak before As, I am thinking what else would happen to me under the stress in medical school. Even though I have taken steps to relieve stress by exercising or whatsoever, I realised I'm a person who likes to overthink and give myself stress. If so, I think I wouldn't survive in medicine. All in all, do you think I should go for pharmacy instead of medicine? So that 1. I can still help others in a healthcare sector and take time to improve my social skills without killing a life if I were to enter medicine. 2. I can face less stress compared to being in medicine?? (Tbh, I can only visualize myself as a researcher making contribution towards science behind the scene instead of being a front-line person, although I havent had any true research experience lol) 2) Bio vs Chem As mentioned earlier, I liked Bio less in JC because the syllabus is full of micro-level stuff and also cuz of its rigidness (like there's tons to keywords to memorise). I enjoyed Chem in JC more probably because it's easier to learn. In my case, should I apply for chem course instead of bio(life sciences/biological science)?

What she is trying to say is that the entire admissions process, even with the grades required, is skewed towards the JC kids.  Some examples: 1) Poly application window is in Feb, basically when we are busiest with our last projects in poly life (poly kids will know this as hell week), we still have to complete our application. I am not sure if it applies to every JC, but I know some JC provide guidance to their students in writing their personal statement if required. Poly - I tried to ask for help, but no one could help me lol. I even went for further ed/career guidance counselling but it seems that I know the facts and the competitiveness better than the counselor. So yes, poly is expecting poly kids to go out and work after poly. (But let's be honest - so many of us still want to move onto uni, public or private) JC kids - you all basically on holiday when expected to make an application.  2) As she mentioned - Open House AFTER our application. When I was NUS' Open Day, I went to the admissions booth to ask about something and there was an Indian father with his son from IB, also asking why is the Open House after their application. Yeah, you could say that we can still find out information on our own, call NUS to ask them about their programs if we are interested etc but aren't we just as much of an applicant and prospective student as the JC kids are... But truth is that they are still looking to recruit JC kids that's why the Open Day is so conveniently dated after their A'Level results are released. (P.S.: IB even earlier, apply in Jan) 3) Considering us based on 4 or 5 sems - NTU considered only my 4-semesters worth of results when making an offer as I could only submit 4-sems at the point of application. I am now appealing to my first choice but as all of us here know, chances are very slim. So my question is - why can't they hold onto their decisions and decide with my full cert? My final sem results literally is my entire year 3 modules because 5th sem roll over to the final sem due to FYP judging. Their explanation is for those with 5 sems, usually not much of a diff by the time 6th sem come, which I agree to some extent, but I believe if the student manage to pull up his grades enough to qualify him for the course he wants, it is doing disservice to his efforts. It is like making a decision based on your prelim results for A'Level kids. I am not complaining about how the odds are against us to begin with. I am just asking for the universities to see all applicants as equal, and given an equally fair shot at being considered. Sorry for the long wall of text - I just want to give you guys some context, which I don't think JC kids would know if not.  ((Tbh, poly kids if you all don't have a preference, there are several engineering is not that hard to go in if you don't mind. GPA 3.4? 3.5? to safely secure a place. 3.4/3.5 should be manageable if you don't slack off too much and put in effort for your assignment/projects, and study for your exams.)) Guys stop arguing here. You just need to work hard whichever path you take that's all.  For myself, I went to Poly, achieved CGPA 3.99/4.00. Doing a SMU Double Degree in Business & Accountancy now and my CGPA is 3.90/4.00 - which is Summa Cum Laude, First Class Honours. And my GPA is obviously higher than quite alot of JC/IB students in SMU, even though I'm from Poly. At the end of the day, stop whining and crying over where you came from. Whether you came from a non-privileged or privileged background, if you did not get a spot in a Local Uni you only have yourself to blame because you did not work hard enough during 'A' levels or Poly.  And Poly students, you know fully well that more spots are allocated to JC students. It's a fact. Move on with it. You know that only the top 10 - 15% of the Poly cohort gets Local Uni admissions. So what if it's not equal, the government has been pushing for an increase in no. of spots allocated to Poly students.  And so what if it's not equal? Being the top 10-15% in poly shows your immense pedigree. Same logic goes to applying for Ivy Leagues with acceptance rates of 1%, you gonna complain to them to ask them to increase their acceptance rate? Or you going to work hard to be part of that 1%? Get over it.  And don't even talk about difference in opportunities because even I wasn't born with a silver spoon myself. Wherever you come from, work hard and succeed.

He just has higher expectations than the general populace when it comes to retaking A levels. Yes,he might not have gotten crappy results,but I can offer an alternative side of the story since I known him during my JC days. During my JC days,I didn't know louie till J2,when my friend invited him over to join us for a game of badminton on a Saturday in our JC. Back then, I only knew louie as being one of the best in maths/chem in my JC and he did well for that in his first A levels,so I was amazed that he was considering of retaking A's  with his results during NS(1yr my senior). He later,told me that he wasn't satisfied with his A levels results,as he hopes to get into pharmacy in NUS.  I lost contact with him,till I finished NS and I was surprised to learn that he took a gap yr after his NS,to volunteer in hospitals and also retake the A levels. I guess at this point of time,girls should be able to empathise with him at the very least,since he went through an extra yr after NS to re-do his A's. In fact,he told me his plans to re-take As this yr,but I advised him not to and to apply for university instead,since it's counter-intuitive to not go into uni,given his financial circumstances.(He can't consider overseas) Though he didn't get to pharmacy(I guess it's pharmacy's loss to not accept him), he got into nanyang scholarship programme,after all the efforts invested. I feel it's a valiant effort,coming from someone who didn't have any tuition,academic guidance during his period of retakes and still managed to make unconventional decisions(that might not seem logical to the majority) that guaranteed his success. Don't judge the book by it's cover,is all I have to say,to anyone who doubts that he doesn't experience emotional pain after each admission cycle. Emotional pain after each admission cycle? This is weird, anyone who did worse than him is suffering worse than him during the admission cycle. He did well to qualify for 95% of the courses in local university, but he is just being bent on getting into Pharmacy.  What Eddie previously meant that Louie was not the most suited person to share his experience about a success story from past failures. An example of a ''real success story'' would be middleofnowhere. He has already been performing extremely well in school, as well in A Levels. But in terms of providing advice to students who are retaking A levels (because they have failed), he will not be able to provide helpful advice. It is not a loss that Pharmacy did not accept him, but he did not fulfil the requirements set by the administration. You mentioned it as a courageous effort of him to retake A levels countless of time despite his financial difficulties, no tuition, etc. But, bear in mind, is he can choose not to retake A levels 4 times and enter Uni straight after NS, but he chose not to. He chose merely because he is obsessed into getting the course he wished to enter. Frankly speaking, from your entire paragraph, what are you trying to conclude? You kept harping on the fact that he retook A levels as if he has no choice, difficult economic situations, people must empathise him, he is really bold in making such decisions, etc.. But, you must not be biased in your opinions just because he is your classmate. I mean, also do clarify what emotional pain that he has to undergo? Being not able to enter Pharmacy, despite having tons of other choices waiting for him to choose from? There are many people out there with so little options to choose from, their emotional pain is far much worse than what he is facing.. Nevertheless, it is great that he finally resigned to his fate and know that he has a slim chance into entering Pharmacy. He should have done that 2 years back, and not clinging on to the hope that he can enter Pharmacy one day. If he had entered any course 2 years back, he can graduate earlier and support his family earlier.",12.917230199445594

Due to its non-traditional assessment methods, a lot of grading is done somewhat arbitrarily by the facilitator. Get marks for asking questions in class...thanks... 3) PBL-approach is questionable. While sounding good in theory, PBL can only be applied in limited circumstances. Why? It only works if all participants have decent knowledge of the topic at hand. Putting random people together and asking them to solve a problem just doesn't cut it. Not at a level where participants only have 'O' Level knowledge. 4) SP/NP prepares its students better for a university education. Due to its traditional teaching methods, SP/NP students will be more prepared to enter university. They have good grounding in key concepts. University business courses do have some ""PBL-related"" assignments, but they are done in conjunction with traditional teaching. First year is definitely spent on fundamentals. Summary: I am not anti-RP per se. But the school has hyped itself to have a revolutionary teaching method. Does it work? Do RP grads perform better than SP/NP grads at work? Maybe, maybe not. From what I see at least, the RP grads who did well in uni, actually spent the most time getting their basics right. They knew it was a different ballgame from RP, and they were prepared to put in the effort to sit down and learn.  They knew that uni was not going to be a place where you can spend all your time googling for answers, discussing them, and then presenting them.

I even heard that some corporate employers prefer engineering students over those of other disciplines, since they are trained with problem-solving skills.(my brother is doing engineering in ntu). Downsides of engineering is that it is very tough if you have no interest. Otherwise, you can try for the less popular social sciences also such as history or english! Take the accounts about not being able to find jobs with a pinch of salt, there can be many factors such as the applicant simply having bad grades, an unimpressive portfolio, or even being too picky.  Sadly to say, I don't think you should put too much hope on NUS unless you are planning to go through discretionary admissions.(still can try of course, no harm. my results were significantly lower than yours when i applied last year) SMU might have slight chance to land an interview, but of course there's also the problem of passing the interviews. In summary, I would say your best bet is in NTU's engineering or social sciences. icic, but which engineering in NTU is more useful here?

2017,nanyang technological university|ntu|computer|com|infosys|information systems|analytics|smart city,temasek polytechnic|temasek poly|tp,"Hi everyone, just thought that I have provide some insight into the difference between the Economics and Political Science courses in NUS and NTU, for those who have received offers from both and are facing difficulty making a decision. These observations will exclude factors of prestige, ranking, internship opportunities, salary etc so that you can make a better decision without the common biases.Economics Most students entering economics often fear the maths component, which is an integral part of the field. If you observe the modules, you would see that NTU has slightly more qualitative mods than NUS, which has more quantitative mods. For those interested in the policy and developmental part of economics, it seems that NTU may be the better option for you. Furthermore, there is direct entry for a double major in Econs + PPGA at NTU, which further benefits students by exploring the interconnectedness of both fields. NUS however has more mods that cater to different levels of learning. Their mods have different levels and parts, so that you can get as much depth as width of mods. If you are one who prefers more depth than width, NUS might be for you.Political Science Many get confuse with the term PPGA, often equating it to Political Science in general. They do display similarities but differ slightly. You see, PPGA can be said to be a subset of political science, which has fields of (1) political theory, (2) comparative politics, (3) public policy, and (4) international relations. I hope you can see where PPGA fits in now. The PPGA course, as suggested in its name, focuses on public policy, public administration and international relations. Their public administration mods are certainly in greater abundance than NUS. NTU mods also draw more of its lesson examples from SEA and Asia as compared to NUS which has mods tackling politics of western democracies as well. On the other side, NUS has more mods spread across the different subfields (although PT is still quite little as it ain't really very popular). Their array of mods is also greater compared to NTU.Bonus (SMU) Economics in SMU is highly highly quantitative. Those majoring in Econs can even take Actuarial Science as a 2nd major and you would see that the mods. If that quantitative economics and being an actuary is a career choice for you, go for SMU. Social sciences in SMU are somewhat in little amount. As compared to institutions with higher research output like NUS and NTU, the amount and variety of mods are quite little. But SMU does emphasise a lot on interdisciplinary, as the social science component, I feel, is meant to strengthen your understanding of corporate fundamentals. So it does offer the best of both worlds for those who want to be expose to business as well as social science. If academic research is your thing however, this might not be for you. However, if you are in PLE, that's a different story and I'm sure you can see why. I hope this can help some of you all make more informed decisions on the schools you want to end up in. Remember it is not just about the prestige, but the style of learning that suits/challenges you.",10.191731310656074

I was working under contract for the 1 gap year as a support/customer service before moving into the admin support and then I resigned end Feb this year to focus on my uni applications. If it helps, I can also give info on my CCA/extra-curricular contributions: I was Student Conductor when I was in my JC's choir, and we did some voluntary works - once at an old aged home and another with single parents and their kids. We also got a Silver Award at the Singapore International Choral Festival 2015 and my JC recognized my efforts with awards for leadership and team (merit and distinction respectively).

"" http://news.nus.edu.sg/highlights/nu...on-initiatives NUS applicants to get bonus points for 1st-choice courses Passion for a field of study will count for admission to the National University of Singapore (NUS) from this year. Those applying for a place at NUS will be given 1.25 bonus points for their first choice - equivalent to going from C to B or B to A in an A-level H1 subject. This applies only to courses where entry is based purely on converting a student's grades into points, and not to courses such as medicine and law where students are assessed on their aptitude and interests through interviews. NUS senior deputy president and provost Ho Teck Hua, who announced the move at a press conference on Monday, said NUS analysis of admission data showed the bonus point can make a difference. ""Let's say one student with 81 points applies for communications as his first choice, and another with 82 points applies to the same course as his second choice. With the 1.25 points, the student who lists the course as his first choice will get ahead of the person with 82 points,"" he said. On why NUS decided on the move, he said: ""If you have done well and are passionate about a career in business or computing, for example, then we want to say to you that we support your passion."" ""We want to help you pursue your passion,"" he said, adding that students passionate about what they study tend to perform better. Professor Ho revealed that, currently, 65 per cent of students given a place in their first-choice course take up the offer, while only 45 per cent of those given their second-choice course do so. Noting NUS graduates' good job prospects, Prof Ho also announced that NUS will be increasing the number of double majors to increase career options for its graduates. ""The nature of work is changing very rapidly, and we need to prepare students for a lifetime of diverse careers,"" he said. He said NUS, which currently offers 94 double major and major-minor combinations, will add another 86 such programmes. ""Someone doing data science and entrepreneurship, for example, can go and work for a range of industries in data science, and also go and do a start-up."" On top of the double majors, NUS also offers 71 double degrees, 33 joint degrees with partner universities and 24 concurrent degrees. Adding all this, currently 15 per cent of NUS students are trained in more than one discipline. Prof Ho said he hopes half of all NUS students will graduate with knowledge and skills in two different fields, so they will have more job offers to choose from. He also announced two new degree programmes for this year, one in pharmaceutical science and the other in veterinary science. Students taking up the 5 1/2-year concurrent veterinary degree programme will graduate with an NUS degree in life sciences and a Doctor of Veterinary Medicine from the University of Melbourne. NUS, which now offers 230 bond-free merit scholarships, will add 200 more scholarships for the new academic year. Ms Geraldine Tan, 19, welcomed the move by NUS and said it is important for young people to get into a field that excites them.

2018,nanyang technological university|ntu|computer|com|infosys|information systems|analytics|smart city,Republic Polytechnic|Republic poly|rp,"Good news for those borderline cases eyeing NUS "" . . . . the plan to award up to 1.25 bonus points (equivalent of one H1 grade) to students applying for their first choice programme. The bonus points, applicable to programmes not requiring a pre-entry interview, will be added to the student’s University Admission Score. "" http://news.nus.edu.sg/highlights/nu...on-initiatives NUS applicants to get bonus points for 1st-choice courses Passion for a field of study will count for admission to the National University of Singapore (NUS) from this year. Those applying for a place at NUS will be given 1.25 bonus points for their first choice - equivalent to going from C to B or B to A in an A-level H1 subject. This applies only to courses where entry is based purely on converting a student's grades into points, and not to courses such as medicine and law where students are assessed on their aptitude and interests through interviews. NUS senior deputy president and provost Ho Teck Hua, who announced the move at a press conference on Monday, said NUS analysis of admission data showed the bonus point can make a difference. ""Let's say one student with 81 points applies for communications as his first choice, and another with 82 points applies to the same course as his second choice. With the 1.25 points, the student who lists the course as his first choice will get ahead of the person with 82 points,"" he said. On why NUS decided on the move, he said: ""If you have done well and are passionate about a career in business or computing, for example, then we want to say to you that we support your passion."" ""We want to help you pursue your passion,"" he said, adding that students passionate about what they study tend to perform better. Professor Ho revealed that, currently, 65 per cent of students given a place in their first-choice course take up the offer, while only 45 per cent of those given their second-choice course do so. Noting NUS graduates' good job prospects, Prof Ho also announced that NUS will be increasing the number of double majors to increase career options for its graduates. ""The nature of work is changing very rapidly, and we need to prepare students for a lifetime of diverse careers,"" he said. He said NUS, which currently offers 94 double major and major-minor combinations, will add another 86 such programmes. ""Someone doing data science and entrepreneurship, for example, can go and work for a range of industries in data science, and also go and do a start-up."" On top of the double majors, NUS also offers 71 double degrees, 33 joint degrees with partner universities and 24 concurrent degrees. Adding all this, currently 15 per cent of NUS students are trained in more than one discipline. Prof Ho said he hopes half of all NUS students will graduate with knowledge and skills in two different fields, so they will have more job offers to choose from. He also announced two new degree programmes for this year, one in pharmaceutical science and the other in veterinary science. Students taking up the 5 1/2-year concurrent veterinary degree programme will graduate with an NUS degree in life sciences and a Doctor of Veterinary Medicine from the University of Melbourne. NUS, which now offers 230 bond-free merit scholarships, will add 200 more scholarships for the new academic year. Ms Geraldine Tan, 19, welcomed the move by NUS and said it is important for young people to get into a field that excites them.

Totally agree with you that scholarship should not be awarded based on academic performance only, which I did mention in my earlier post. The primary objective of my earlier post aims to encourage individuals who are currently applying/appealing for admission and/or scholarship - through the sharing of my education journey and the challenges experienced as an individual with a disadvantaged background. Subsequently, the post also seeks to highlight the flaws in the basis of selection for the scholarship interview. Today, institutions are still using a uniform assessment method to evaluate people of diverse backgrounds. The assessment for academic potential is pretty straightforward - cGPA, awards, and other academic achievement obtained from other sources (e.g. competitions, courses, etc.). The tricky part lies in the assessment of non-academic components - institutions seek individuals with certain attributes, qualities, and skills (e.g. leadership, teamwork, entrepreneurship, integrity, sports achievement, etc.). And often, institutions only consider school-related activities and/or co-curricular activities as the samples for their assessment.  On a personal note, I believed that those attributes, qualities, and skillscould also beidentified and assessed through employment experience (e.g. customers' testimonials, appraisals by superiors, awards attained, etc.).  In general, institutions should also look beyond the school-related activities and co-curricular activities when assessing the non-academic components of individuals. Hence, granting more flexibility for underprivileged students whose non-academic profile were considered as ""insubstantial"" and thereby allowing  them to have the opportunity to share their stories. Ultimately, an interview is all we need.P.s. I'm glad that your hard work paid off, and congrats on securing that scholarship offered by a private company  (I missed the application deadline for private & government scholarship ) To be shortlisted for interview on the government scholarship with 3.5GPA, you must have some really outstanding non-academic achievements! Do you mind to share with us? And hello senior , assuming you are an SMU student (based on the GPA capped at 4.0). As an individual with similar experience, juggling between full-time work and study is really no joke, not to mention that you are doing it at the University-level and still managed to scored a decent grade. Mind to share what full-time job you work as? Do you study in the day, and work at night/after-school hours? Did you, perhaps, packed all modules into that few days so that you could work for the rest of the days in the week? Sincerely hope that you can share some tips with us/me Networking/cloud computing consultant.

Yes the director said that. Yes the deadlines are like that.  But, noone said you can't submit projects early. Also this is university. Anyone who expects projects to be scoped to only what is learnt in lectures needs a wake up call. Also, the fear mongering here is a little overdone. Its all about the aptitude for absorbing information. I know a guy from an unrelated diploma with 0 coding knowledge on track for first class while a 3.6 it diploma person is struggling to pass. I come from a decent secondary school. 80% of my class went to A levels. Majority dont even consider SIT. Those good enough to go to NTU SMU NUS SUTD will go there instead. The students in ICT right now are basically guinea pigs. Its a risk they dont have to take.  For those that don't do well enough probably don't like studying altogether and would rather go to sim for a faster degree or will choose to retake a levels. That leaves us with the ones that do badly for A levels and are desperate to get into a 'local uni' without wasting time. Its not surprising that these people end up getting rejected after being interviewed. Edit: One thing that I need to mention is the program is in NO WAY designed that you NEED to know how to code before coming. Saying so is discrediting the professors that work hard to design the program.  The ramp up is fast I admit, but thats the nature of computer science ask anyone in nus/ntu comp sci or smu is, they will tell you the same thing.

I challenge anyone who has seen that to tell me that its not meant for someone with 0 background in coding. The professors themselves reiterate in the first lecture to tell us not to worry if you have no background because they will teach the basics to you.

SMU rejected me or on waiting list now. Prepared so much in the topic but apparently not on the dress code or speaking enough like an ang moh. I was the only one that came in jeans and sneakers while everyone else were wearing formal. Is that overdress or what's to be expected? (I don't get why the email even said smart casual, but I just followed the email...) NTU and NUS completely ignoring me forever. I've gotten so depressed I'm no longer depressed. Perhaps this is one way of curing yourself of depression: where everything becomes a delusion and nothing in life matters anymore. It sucks that everything to form a judgment on someone can just be based on a single event on a single day and nothing else, but well, that's life. You can say there's still time but I just can't take waiting up to 3 agonizing more months later. If anything, the only realistic thing in life that will ever happen is me writing that appeal letter. Before your comments get lost in the sea of comments on this very active forum, let me reply to your rant/concerns. I just want to say that I get you. I totally do. Why? I was once in your position last year. Unknowingly fell into depression during the waiting period from April to May because I waited hopelessly for things that eventually (and obviously) did not come true... Exactly 1 year ago on this date (13 April 2017), I received a devastating offer from NTU — environmental engineering, and that was my last choice. It was supposed to be a celebration, that I received an offer, but it was the absolute last thing I wanted, since it wasn't my first choice, and something that I knew I couldn't accept doing (and was stupid enough to even place it in my choices, ah well).  Subsequently I got rejected by NUS and SMU, because I simply didn't make the cut... With a heavy heart I signed up (late) for private A levels, and as much as I hated the idea of having to retake, having to suffer... I had no choice. I really wanted to prove to myself that I CAN get into local uni. It didn't help when I'm from one of the top JCs, and my friends are moving on happily to overseas unis with unconditional offers, scholarships, or medicine, law, dentistry... you name it. I was utterly alone. And I felt like I was the only loser in my school (and also a disgrace to my school) who had to retake A levels, who couldn't really make the cut for local uni. In the end, ALL my appeals failed. What's new? Reality slapped me hard in the face, and it hurt like a bitch, of course. What could I do? I had to move on. I then spent some time correcting my mindset before I was actually more mentally stable for my exams. But I just have to tell you that you are really doing yourself a huge disfavour right now. Yes you are disappointed, you are not receiving news, everything seems oh so damn hopeless. But self pity will only kill you, as well as the people around you who love and care for you... do know that YOU are not the only one suffering, your family and friends are too! Everything seems bleak right now yes, but once you get that offer, everything will be merry and bright...  For me, I knew that I wanted to go to uni. I spent that one more year not just preparing for retake, but also redefining my goals and aspirations in my life. Also, building on my character. Depression no more! There were many sacrifices made, many times that I felt like hiding in a cave... but I overcame that and grew so much stronger. As long as you YEARN it, you will get it no matter what, because no one can stop you!! So don't even let the demons in your head stop you, please do not give in to depression. No one can help you except yourself. I suggest you try meditation and yoga, those things saved my ass (': And here I am back this year, legitly exactly one year later. I received my offer from NTU business...... It took one more year, but it was so worth it. Although my story might not be the most impressive one, but I've proved to everyone and most importantly myself that if I want something, I'm gonna make sure I get it, even if it means one year later. Because this is my future, and I am the captain of my ship of fate. I hope that you realise this too, be proud of who you are, of your battlescars, failures and experiences. All these will shape you into who you are — a better you. Chin up!! ",15.003723753286318

Memory allocation now is important, assigning var with wrong format and precision will cause C application to crash. For ICT1004, given 4 weeks to create a scheduling system in PHP, SQL, CSS3,HTML5 following the semantic requirements, JavaScript/jQuery. If you are unlucky that 2 of out of 4 teammates not contribute much, you will having the feeling of a sinking boat. Just a project in ICT1004 implement all this different language.  If you are totally new to programming, having ICT1001 supplement these knowledge such as SQL query statement. ICT1001 doesn't teach how to write stored procedure and other more advanced SQL statement such as left join, right join, union etc, while project if you know these trick, it can decrease the burden of writing inefficient codes. Also freeloader in ICT is another problem, playing taichi and act blur not contributing to project while others doing the project, they use the time to study for class test and exam. Also known as ""being carried"". During exam for the first trimester, some wrote C code in PHP question, PHP code in Python question, Python code in JavaScript. You will have the confusion especially when you do not have the IDE to highlight code error. Yes, it was very obvious many people found memory allocation and pointers difficult for C. However, if you systematically did everything taught in the lecture. There wouldn't have been a problem. This is one of the parts that had to make sense to you.  But there are tons of many online materials that teach the same thing like on geeksforgeeks that approach the same concept from a different angle. Once it concept clicks, however, it's really hard to forget it. I see a of people spend more time complaining that C is really hard than actually trying to understand the concept.  Take me for example, I pretty much skipped reading and writing files lecture but I was assigned the reading and writing for the 1002 project among other things. To be helpful I had to understand the lecture, so I did that on my own time and because of that. I didn't have to 'memorize' reading and writing for the exam because I had first hand experience implementing it in the project and it was pretty much a giveaway when it came out for the exam. For 1004, yes, it felt like a sinking boat if half your teammates were useless. Now you just blamed the teammates. Which means the project itself, isn't that big of a deal for a 4 'non-useless' group. Many groups even had 5 members. How my group did it was there was a Javascript in charge, PHP in charge, SQL in charge. and the last guy designs with CSS and HTML5.  I'm pretty sure there was no need for jQuery. Also, putting CSS and HTML as another 'difficult' factor is laughable. The labs should have drilled some semantic sense into your skull if you had Dr A, so that shouldn't have been a problem There was some overlapping and confusion but hey this is group work and we figured it out. Also, the world isn't perfect someone is bound to be struggling and someone else has to help them out with it. But if time was managed properly, theres really no excuse even for this 1004 project. Did we take the same 1001 subject here? Since when was there a need for Left or Right join for 1001 SQL. All we needed to know was queries and nested queries. Simple stuff. The word union in itself is self explanatory. A 5 minute google would have explained the syntax. Literally everyone got a good grade for 1001 and this is not including those that exempted the subject for prior knowledge. It was a good introductory course and it didn't go too in depth into any topic. Yes, there might be less burden for projects. However, for that whole semester only 1004 needed SQL. It wouldn't have made much of a difference anyway. Freeloaders are a problem everywhere. People have their priorities. Some just want a degree and pass. While it's not right to freeload, its not right to impose your goals onto others. It's not that the freeloaders want to be freeloaders. From my experience, for the 'known freeloaders' if you ask them to do something specific and early enough. They will do it. Just passively remind them. You gotta take the effort to do so. It's people management. If you ask them to do something when tests starts piling up. Thats no good. My approach is to just carry. I learn a lot from carrying. Try it. Even if you are 'alone' in your group. I'm sure your friends from other groups are willing to help. If you don't have friends, thats another problem. Confusion in exam is a lame excuse. I think it happened to me for 1 paper but it was like 2 marks I can afford to give. It's not like you have 2 papers a day. You have 5 papers spread over 2 weeks. I thought the spread was quite nice. The concepts learnt in the different languages are SOO DIFFERENT. Sure, if you accidentally write var something for a python exam, it might be a problem syntactically. But, I have 100% confidence you don't get marked down for such silly mistakes.  Yes, the programming exams have 2 languages per paper. But python and C are SOO different that its an impossible issue. Heck the things you learn in C you probably don't even know how to do it in Python. Java and C++ might confuse some people I understand but 1.5 months of purely working in one language seems enough to get used to the differences.",14.393619787278357

First and foremost, please take the employment surveys as a pinch of salt. Your salary won't be guaranteed to be higher just because you are enrolled in a particular university that is reported to have higher gross starting pay. Trust me,  when I was deciding on uni like you guys many years ago, I was affected by the graduate employment survey as well but then after years in uni and finally working,  I realised the survey might be misleading... Just so you know, most of these times when the graduates answer these surveys, the schools don't even check whether the pay you entered is true or not...How much you will get for your starting pay depends on your EXPERIENCE, your GRADES, your NEGOTIATION SKILLS, the ECONOMIC OUTLOOK at that POINT IN TIME,  the INDUSTRY and JOB SCOPE. Which uni honestly doesn't matter, cos all 3 local unis are considered on par to one another in the employers' eyes.  and it's just gross pay. There are other components in a salary package like bonuses and benefits which are not captured in the employment surveys. Some people may have a lower gross pay but may have higher bonuses and benefits (eg more days of leave) than someone with higher gross pay who may have less attractive bonuses and benefits. And many times, these surveys are not even representative of the whole student population as not all 100% of the graduating cohort would have completed the survey. Maybe it's just that small handful of students who did the survey and skewed the data?  regarding the point about students in nus being only able to source for internships from career office... That is not true at all. You can always self source (meaning you apply via websites like linkedin for eg by yourself) Oh and student exchange definitely must apply via student office regardless of whether is it nus ntu or smu... Cos all uni already have a list of overseas exchange partner universities that students can apply to then the student office will facilitate the process lor. The process is more or less the same across all 3 uni de.  And one more thing about nus I thought is worth mentioning, they have this NUS Overseas College (NOC) programme where you get to spend 1 year overseas studying and interning... You get to accumulate overseas work exp and clear modules like exchange as well. And the internships are paid. And there are many countries u can go to via this programme - Europe, Asia, USA. Do look it up. I kinda regretted not going 😭 cos it's such a valuable opportunity esp if u are passionate about entrepreneurship.Even if u are not its fine it's still great overseas exposure and it value adds to your resume! Oh and every school is competitive, not just SMU because regardless of which course or uni you go to, the bell curve is everywhere.  Choose your school based on the curriculum, the non academic opportunities available and the culture. Talk to seniors Or students who are studying in the universities and courses you have in mind to find out more. Talk to the recent students who have just graduated to find out more about the actual employment prospects and salary trends across the various unis and courses.  Hope this helps more people to come to a decision on which school to choose.",14.107035811685977

You asked for people to rate your chances, and just because many rated it as very low or even impossible, you call people a wet blanket.

I don't think that they're trying to be a 'wet blanket' to pull you down but trying to process  some thoughts. From your comments you seemed like a confident person but maybe a little hung onto your past, you may have scored well during O lvls for L1R4 but maybe things happen which caused you to not do well. However consoling yourself that you're the second of your clique doesn't seem to me as a good mindset as you're just limiting yourself. (Staying in your comfort zone.)  Maybe you can try studying for SATs and A lvls for next year or maybe for when you ORD like little by little during the weekends or something.

The ramp up is fast I admit, but thats the nature of computer science ask anyone in nus/ntu comp sci or smu is, they will tell you the same thing.

If you don't believe me, ask the famous yanying/guyz92 to send you the first few lectures for 1002, which module title is literally programming fundamentals.  I challenge anyone who has seen that to tell me that its not meant for someone with 0 background in coding. The professors themselves reiterate in the first lecture to tell us not to worry if you have no background because they will teach the basics to you. Agreed on the part for ICT1002 Programming Fundamental, Python is for beginners to learn as var in Python is loosely assign, don't have to care about memory allocation etc. Once student touch C will be another extreme. Memory allocation now is important, assigning var with wrong format and precision will cause C application to crash. For ICT1004, given 4 weeks to create a scheduling system in PHP, SQL, CSS3,HTML5 following the semantic requirements, JavaScript/jQuery. If you are unlucky that 2 of out of 4 teammates not contribute much, you will having the feeling of a sinking boat. Just a project in ICT1004 implement all this different language.  If you are totally new to programming, having ICT1001 supplement these knowledge such as SQL query statement. ICT1001 doesn't teach how to write stored procedure and other more advanced SQL statement such as left join, right join, union etc, while project if you know these trick, it can decrease the burden of writing inefficient codes. Also freeloader in ICT is another problem, playing taichi and act blur not contributing to project while others doing the project, they use the time to study for class test and exam. Also known as ""being carried"". During exam for the first trimester, some wrote C code in PHP question, PHP code in Python question, Python code in JavaScript.

Once it concept clicks, however, it's really hard to forget it. I see a of people spend more time complaining that C is really hard than actually trying to understand the concept.  Take me for example, I pretty much skipped reading and writing files lecture but I was assigned the reading and writing for the 1002 project among other things. To be helpful I had to understand the lecture, so I did that on my own time and because of that. I didn't have to 'memorize' reading and writing for the exam because I had first hand experience implementing it in the project and it was pretty much a giveaway when it came out for the exam. For 1004, yes, it felt like a sinking boat if half your teammates were useless. Now you just blamed the teammates. Which means the project itself, isn't that big of a deal for a 4 'non-useless' group. Many groups even had 5 members. How my group did it was there was a Javascript in charge, PHP in charge, SQL in charge. and the last guy designs with CSS and HTML5.  I'm pretty sure there was no need for jQuery. Also, putting CSS and HTML as another 'difficult' factor is laughable. The labs should have drilled some semantic sense into your skull if you had Dr A, so that shouldn't have been a problem There was some overlapping and confusion but hey this is group work and we figured it out. Also, the world isn't perfect someone is bound to be struggling and someone else has to help them out with it. But if time was managed properly, theres really no excuse even for this 1004 project. Freeloaders are a problem everywhere. People have their priorities. Some just want a degree and pass. While it's not right to freeload, its not right to impose your goals onto others. It's not that the freeloaders want to be freeloaders. From my experience, for the 'known freeloaders' if you ask them to do something specific and early enough. They will do it. Just passively remind them. You gotta take the effort to do so. It's people management. If you ask them to do something when tests starts piling up. Thats no good. My approach is to just carry. I learn a lot from carrying. Try it. Even if you are 'alone' in your group. I'm sure your friends from other groups are willing to help. If you don't have friends, thats another problem.Geeksforgeeks is really a God Sent website to learn Data Structure and Algorithm and other last minute revision. Used that and it really save asses. To clarify the part regarding ICT1004,  I did not blame any teammates who are weaker, people come in different shapes and sizes, thus no one is perfect in this world. Agreed the point you mentioned regarding how you manage your projects and freeloader issue. Think of it this way, since each student have different priority, if it doesn't affect you, just ignores about them. They paid their school fees,  if they don't learn anything meaningful during the course of study by not even attempt to study or do project, it is at their own disadvantage. In ICT, it is really the experience that counts, the more you do, the more you learn. The true practice oriented degree program provide in Singapore. After all, no point to argue on this kind of topics. In ICT we are 1 big family, so far those I met in my course of study is approachable. Sometime tips can be acquire from the seniors.

Anyway, I'm here to get my chances rated in getting into uni this year. I noticed some of the COP increased and decreased across the Big Three. These are my grades: A for PW, B for GP, BDD/B for my 3H2 1H1 (subject combi is MPC/E) and pass in MTL B. I was working under contract for the 1 gap year as a support/customer service before moving into the admin support and then I resigned end Feb this year to focus on my uni applications.

We also got a Silver Award at the Singapore International Choral Festival 2015 and my JC recognized my efforts with awards for leadership and team (merit and distinction respectively).

"" http://news.nus.edu.sg/highlights/nu...on-initiatives NUS applicants to get bonus points for 1st-choice courses Passion for a field of study will count for admission to the National University of Singapore (NUS) from this year. Those applying for a place at NUS will be given 1.25 bonus points for their first choice - equivalent to going from C to B or B to A in an A-level H1 subject. This applies only to courses where entry is based purely on converting a student's grades into points, and not to courses such as medicine and law where students are assessed on their aptitude and interests through interviews. NUS senior deputy president and provost Ho Teck Hua, who announced the move at a press conference on Monday, said NUS analysis of admission data showed the bonus point can make a difference. ""Let's say one student with 81 points applies for communications as his first choice, and another with 82 points applies to the same course as his second choice. With the 1.25 points, the student who lists the course as his first choice will get ahead of the person with 82 points,"" he said. On why NUS decided on the move, he said: ""If you have done well and are passionate about a career in business or computing, for example, then we want to say to you that we support your passion."" ""We want to help you pursue your passion,"" he said, adding that students passionate about what they study tend to perform better. Professor Ho revealed that, currently, 65 per cent of students given a place in their first-choice course take up the offer, while only 45 per cent of those given their second-choice course do so. Noting NUS graduates' good job prospects, Prof Ho also announced that NUS will be increasing the number of double majors to increase career options for its graduates. ""The nature of work is changing very rapidly, and we need to prepare students for a lifetime of diverse careers,"" he said. He said NUS, which currently offers 94 double major and major-minor combinations, will add another 86 such programmes. ""Someone doing data science and entrepreneurship, for example, can go and work for a range of industries in data science, and also go and do a start-up."" On top of the double majors, NUS also offers 71 double degrees, 33 joint degrees with partner universities and 24 concurrent degrees. Adding all this, currently 15 per cent of NUS students are trained in more than one discipline. Prof Ho said he hopes half of all NUS students will graduate with knowledge and skills in two different fields, so they will have more job offers to choose from. He also announced two new degree programmes for this year, one in pharmaceutical science and the other in veterinary science. Students taking up the 5 1/2-year concurrent veterinary degree programme will graduate with an NUS degree in life sciences and a Doctor of Veterinary Medicine from the University of Melbourne. NUS, which now offers 230 bond-free merit scholarships, will add 200 more scholarships for the new academic year. Ms Geraldine Tan, 19, welcomed the move by NUS and said it is important for young people to get into a field that excites them. She said: ""I really want to study business and maybe go on an overseas college stint as I want to start a social enterprise. Business courses are hard to get into, so I am hoping the bonus points will help me get the edge.""

Sigh! As a poly grad now in NTU, I only got one answer for all of you poly grads: If your GPA is far from their cut-off, do not pin any hopes on the universities. But if your GPA is nicely within their 10th percentile, then yes you definitely stand a good chance but then again, anything can happen. 3.94 seems okay, you just gotta wait and I hope you wrote well for your personal statement. They don't care what you studied in poly, its the GPA that they look at, and look at only.  So if you have GPA 3.3 and aiming for WKW, I would dare say your chances are very very very slim, even with your Dip w Merit, because there are people from other comms courses who may have a way higher GPA (that may meet the 10th percentile), yet did not get Dip w Merit. If you are trying by DA, which I highly recommend to anyone from poly, you really need to show that you have done comms-related stuff before, best if you have won some awards. CCA records are really nothing in their eyes, because every other JC kid also have good CCA records because it is simply part of their school life. To qualify under DA, you need to have something more than everyone else don't. Even then, there is no guarantee they will call you up for interview.

I recall seeing a comment from a SMU Prof along the lines of - ""If you flip a coin to choose between NUS/NTU/SMU Business Programs, you'll be fine!"". I believe that all things being equal, that very much holds true. However, if I may, I'll like to provide a strategy using the next one week for A Level graduates to consider when ranking choices (Regardless of Major / University): Crash* the classes for the courses you're interested in. Why? 1. Open House events are like CNY. Whole campuses spruce up and show you the best they have to offer. However, its not very reflective of day to day life and you don't have extensive exposure to how classes are conducted. 2. By crashing classes, you figure out a few things that contribute to decision making: - How to travel from home to the destination faculty - Will it be a hassle to travel everyday (or for a 1.5 hr class when my travel time is 1.5 hrs x2) - Does the style of teaching / first impression of profs & faculty / general mood of students suit you  *In terms of crashing classes, I use the term loosely. I generally advise approaching your seniors / friends in faculties and programmes that you're interested in and request for their help in asking Profs for permission to audit (another term for sitting in) sectional classes of 30-50 pax.  For lectures, this is not necessary as attendance is generally not taken and there are too many students to take note of. I also haven't come across Profs that would reject requests from prospective students to audit classes as they still have to teach regardless of your presence! (i.e. you're just taking up an empty space and listening)   For NUS Business, feel free to approach me if you wish to audit classes to help in decision making, I'll be more than happy to liaise with Profs to help prospective students.

ALevels grad, got rejected from SIT. Any SIT seniors could help me out regarding my questions? 1) Currently interested in ICT software engineering and digipen rtis. I heard that ict software engineering doesn't have any alevel grads, so the chances of appealing is like close to 0. Is this true? 2) What are my appeal chances for both of the courses mentioned above? Do I stand a better chance in rtis/ict se? (want to maximise my appealing potential) 3) does anyone has any graduate employment survey for sit ict courses? Can't seem to find any  4) Also, is it true that rtis program must be completed in 3 years instead of the usual 4? Also, is the degree recognised in govt sector? Thank you! During my day zero event at SIT Dover last year, the Deputy Program Director for Software Engineering did said something about ""Everyone who are enrolled into ICT are from Polytechnic"".  The reason for this is they design the program in such a way that you need to know how to code before enroll to the program. ICT SE and IS is very intensive, beginners will have a hard time to catch up. For example, one of our project is to write a web crawler and do data analysis and come out application(s) in C++, it must complete within 4 weeks. Those who have zero programming background will suffer very badly. The lecture slides only teach you how to sit, but project expect you to fly. We have other project running concurrently, including class test. Once project submission is up, next week (two days later) our first exam paper.",9.548990310095904

SMU will be the place to ensure that students are vocal with the emphasis on class participation. As a person who is not outgoing, i am trying to force myself out of my comfort zone.  From what i have researched, NTU/NUS have a more laid back culture which is not going to help me improve at all.  At the end of the day, employers doesn't look at the university that you are from or the ranking that you university have. They look at you. Your soft skills and hard skills are the things that matter the most. SMU Business also have the highest income when compared to the others. Most of us who entered university hopes to achieve a higher income in the future isn't it? Therefore, this would be the ideal choice for me. Not really leh. I browse thru smu modules. Most modules class participation only 10% of total marks, which is similar to NTU/NUS. For some modules,  for participation component, it only require you to do some pre lecture quizzes only.. So i feel that not necessary class participation comprises a lot in SMU. All uni still require you to participate in class, I guess? In conclusion, in depends on lecturer on how they want to allocate the marks for the different components (Quiz, Exam, Grp Proj, Tutorial, etc). Some lecturer may emphasise on class part, some not. Depends on lecturer and the overall school. Some say SMU has a lot of grp project, but being in Nus, almost all the modules also require grp project. So I feel no difference. Probably is their concept of lecture and tutorial which is seminar based, compulsory internship, compulsory community work, compulsory overseas programme, is what attracts employers. Hence for the class part/grp project or being outspoken, I dont really see any diff in all schools. You can still not contribute any inputs during class in smu, and still graduate. Depends on your own personality I feel, nobody can change you if u dont want to. But it is still a fact that employer value smu students compared to the other schools.",9.504425342812835

I received offers for business from NTU, NUS and SMU, but I am deciding between NUS and SMU business. I studied Business in Poly and I am interested to pursue double major in Uni. I am interested in entrepreneurship and want to work at a startup or run my own startup in the future.  Reasons why I want to study at NUS: Pros: - More comfortable with NUS's teaching style of lecture and tutorials which is similar to Poly teaching style  - hall life as I want to experience campus living  - can get 5 modules exemptions and graduate within 3.5 years  - chance to participate in NUS Overseas College Programme  Cons: - Heard it is quite competitive and hard to get into honours programme  - perception that NUS Students do not speak as well compared to SMU Students  - non-compulsory internship so need ownself self source  Reasons why I want to study at SMU: pros:  - stronger employment prospects with higher starting salary and employment rate  - compulsory internship - 100% global exposure to Student exchange programmes, etc - can get 5 modules exemptions and graduate within 3-3.5 years  - gain stronger soft skills  Cons: - may not be comfortable with SMU's seminar style of teaching as I don't participate much in tutorials so may affect class participation Btw nus business students also have compulsory overseas exposure which started from 2017, compared with smu which is starting the compulsory overseas exposure from this year. nus is now also offering a direct honour programmes from 2017 with direct admission to major and minor programmes. Nus has a lot of seminar teaching styles now. It is only for content heavy subjects that they use lecture to teach. So you still need to speak up.http://bba.nus.edu/docs/2018-BBA-Brochure.pdf refere to the nus brochure edit: referring to the GES from the one in reddit, NUS honour students has an employment rate of 93.66% and a mean salary of $4388 while smu cum laude students has an employment rate of 92% and a mean salary of $4504. so if you look at this nus has a higher employment rate albeit lower salary. However, this comparison isnt fair because nus honour students isnt the same as cum laude students of nus",9.662074792801949

Of course, it can simply be because it is the oldest programme and churns out the most Acc graduates every year.  NTU Cons: Pulau NTU  If you're a east-sider you probably have to stay  Cost of degree + cost of hall + food, necessities etc can add up to a hefty sum  SMU Pros:  Forces you to speak up (can be a good or bad thing imo, some just talk nonsense for the sake of participation points)  City campus (depends on where you live and your personal preference)  They also have a very strong career services office. iirc they have strong links with investment banks  Cons:  4 years  11k per year (quite exp compared to NUS, NTU)  High food expenses  Can't really think of any for NUS. I've heard that if you want to go into BIG 4 Audit, starting pay is the same regardless of which school you're from. Hence, it makes more sense to go for the 3 year course, as it allows you to accumulate 1 year worth of experience (and hence the pay jump from Associate 1 to Associate 2 iirc)  If I may add, the first sentence outlining NBS as being the ""oldest and most established"" needs more contextual information - https://bschool.nus.edu.sg/aboutus/a...ory-milestones Cheers",9.645153713255597

Neither does higher grades = higher starting pay. Why in the world would employees pay you more even before you start work just because your GPA is higher?  If you could give me the links of those research that you did, I am keen to take a look.  Personal experience - I took double major but dropped to single. Paying additional 10k (private uni) was not worth it for me as at the end of the day, most companies prefer you to have existing working experience irregardless of relevant degree or not. I have went into different fields (all do not match with my qualifications) and it has never been a problem.  I am in charge of hiring people and double degree do not impress me with zero working experience. Especially coming in demanding high pay and end up being unable to do a decent job.  Another personal experience - My SO was in civil service. Salary is according to what your qualification is i.e. diploma or degree. Not according to GPA. End of year increment and bonus is subjected to work performance. I myself have just started work (private company) but I am getting a lower pay compared to my peers due to long service staff vs newbie despite me having much higher qualifications than them. Another company I went to had all employees start off with the same pay irregardless of experience or qualifications. These are some basic research I did (can’t really find much about it) : https://digitalsenior.sg/getting-a-2nd-major-or-minor/ https://dollarsandsense.sg/pros-and-cons-of-getting-a-double-major-degree-in-singapore/ However, I’d consulted people who are employers, and most of them told me double major will give you an edge, and that it opens up job opportunities! For the higher GPA = higher starting pay, higher GPA gives you a chance to do your honours, and your pay usually depends on whether you had a pass grade vs first class honours. (I’m talking about public sector btw, just like I’d mentioned in the previous post) Even within degree holders, starting pay can be quite different! Can’t say much about private sector though, I’ve always wanted to work in public sector so most of my choices depends on that. For me, I definitely will give up double major! Also, when comparing, (using your example), I think it’s more accurate if you compare NUS scholar (with experience) vs private degree holder(with experience), or Scholar with no experience vs private degree holder with no experience. But I guess interviews play a major part as well",9.508997066043635

Hi, I would say the chance of getting into NUS Comp Sci is low. If u have seen the subject pre requisite for the course, u must have a minimum of B3 for O levels A Maths. If u didn't meet the o level requirement, u need to have Diploma Plus in either Advanced Computing Maths or Advanced Engineering Maths. And if you also don't meet the diploma plus requirement, u will then be considered under the DA section for other achievements. Honestly, Comp Science is a very popular course over these years with a lot of demands(applicants). So your chances to NUS Comp Science is fairly low. I would suggest u to still apply, with the DA cos it highly increases the chances with the achievements u have. Good luck!",11.21630453011025

I feel that SMU is more geared towards business and may not necessarily suits your future career aspirations (not because it's not as good but it doesn't seem in line with your goals) Also, maybe you can take into consideration the environment you work best in and maybe travelling time (because tbh, there shouldn't be that much diff between the 3 uni in terms of prestige- psychology in the 3 uni aren't ranked very highly in the world actually- most of my coursemates would love to enrol in overseas uni if they got the $$$)  also, I am not in the position to speak for poly students since Im from the JC route (so im not very sure ^^""; all I know is that NUS FASS cop is BBC/B and NTU psych cop is AAC/C to apply; I didnt apply to SMU psych- however, i heard it's based more on interviews rather than just your rp like for NTU/NUS? Im not very sure) Actually, you may also consider that NTU psych is a direct honours track, and direct honours is basically what it is; however, if you are not planning to take masters (in which having honours makes it easier to), you should save your money and just go NUS FASS (3 years if you cant/dont want to get honours) Hope this helps!

I think the whole “3 vs 4 years” debate comes up every intake, and it’s easy to think linearly and say that NBS > SMU Biz/Acc. However, would like to point out that: 1) Depending on the number of exemptions, one may be able to complete the program in 3 or 3.5 years, rather than four. 2) SMU’s curriculum is more holistic in that you don’t just take courses specific to your domain, but are able to take a second major to learn a complementary discipline (ie Accounting w/ second major in Finance or Finance w/ a second major in Economics, and there are so many other combinations as well). The core modules also address topics that are quite pertinent to self-improvement, which I think is beneficial.  3) SMU is a management school, and so you get a number of inherent advantages from studying Biz/Acc here. The emphasis on corporate skills, the professors, the school culture, and the proximity to the CBD all contribute to making students more effective management professionals.  4) SMU may not be known for the hostel experience, but the vibrancy of the CCAs more than makes up for it.  Ultimately, I believe the choice has to made by oneself. But I do think the preceding points could definitely aid in one’s research to see what best fits him or her.

You can graduate faster in 3 years and start working earlier, but 4 years lets you do more internships and take more modules. Up to individual preference. 2) The nbs second major is severely limited. It is almost impossible to do a non-traditional second major because you only have 3 years to graduate and very few units for electives. 3) Contrary to popular belief, nbs is not well-known outside Singapore at all , although the ntu brand does have some mileage in asia. 4) CCA is a moot point becauase all unis have CCAs. However, it is true that hall life may be an important consideration for some applicants. And lastly, SMU has way better career services because: - They are located in the city, it is easy to get companies to come down or to get students to attend talks - Because they are located in the city, it is also easy for their students to do part-time internships - They have a much stronger alumni network - Their career service office is much more pro-active than nbs The nbs career office always jokes about how smu students are only good at talking/presentation. But just look at linkedin for the career outcomes of NBS students compared to SMU students. The NBS guy will probably end up in Big4 while the SMU guy is in a bank.

Honestly, it really depends on what you mean by better?   If you look in terms of RP, the 10th percentile for NTU psych is 77/90 while that for NUS FASS is 73/90. So, well you do have a higher percentage of classmates who do really well for A levels and hence, it may be a quite a competitive/motivating environment to spur you to study. [of course looking at RP is quite lame; however, I feel partly why some people presently think NUS psych is better than NTU psych may be because NTU psych used to be where some people go when they can't enter NUS FASS which probably have a higher 10th percentile a few years ago but for recent years, you can clearly see that's not the case] On the other hand, world university rankings for NUS and NTU psychology isn't actually very different and also not really that impressive, truthfully. If you really am passionate about psychology and can afford it, going to US to study psych is of course the best. If you are looking at the S/U system, hands down NUS wins. If you live far from both NTU and NUS such that you are looking at hall stays, obviously NTU halls are better since it is not only cheaper but guaranteed (without any commitment) for 2 years. If you are looking at prestige, the name NUS is probably more WOW among your friendly neighbourhood uncles and aunties but maybe not as wow if your friendly relatives with kids also in uni know you are from FASS (OK DON'T KILL ME but everyone knows how ppl make fun about ppl from arts and social sci in sg). But I mean, you choose to go to the faculty, not for the prestige but passion right so heck care them.  Honestly, i don't think there's much to compare between NTU and NUS psych rn except your own needs (travel time, what kind of culture suits you most, etc.) Have to address this point. FASS takes in students based on faculty than major so hence, the lower RP.  I think it's a better system anyway. Anyone who wants to do psych can do so but they will be cleared away by Y1 anyway.

You directly get into your course in NTU and get modules specifically (i.e. psychology) based.  This is a one of the advantage of being in NTU whereas, i heard sometimes if you want a specific course (i.e. psych) , you have to ""fight"" for it. The more popular the course, the harder to get in.

However, would like to point out that: 1) Depending on the number of exemptions, one may be able to complete the program in 3 or 3.5 years, rather than four. 2) SMU’s curriculum is more holistic in that you don’t just take courses specific to your domain, but are able to take a second major to learn a complementary discipline (ie Accounting w/ second major in Finance or Finance w/ a second major in Economics, and there are so many other combinations as well). The core modules also address topics that are quite pertinent to self-improvement, which I think is beneficial.  3) SMU is a management school, and so you get a number of inherent advantages from studying Biz/Acc here. The emphasis on corporate skills, the professors, the school culture, and the proximity to the CBD all contribute to making students more effective management professionals.  4) SMU may not be known for the hostel experience, but the vibrancy of the CCAs more than makes up for it.  Ultimately, I believe the choice has to made by oneself. But I do think the preceding points could definitely aid in one’s research to see what best fits him or her.

You can graduate faster in 3 years and start working earlier, but 4 years lets you do more internships and take more modules. Up to individual preference. 2) The nbs second major is severely limited. It is almost impossible to do a non-traditional second major because you only have 3 years to graduate and very few units for electives. 3) Contrary to popular belief, nbs is not well-known outside Singapore at all , although the ntu brand does have some mileage in asia. 4) CCA is a moot point becauase all unis have CCAs. However, it is true that hall life may be an important consideration for some applicants. And lastly, SMU has way better career services because: - They are located in the city, it is easy to get companies to come down or to get students to attend talks - Because they are located in the city, it is also easy for their students to do part-time internships - They have a much stronger alumni network - Their career service office is much more pro-active than nbs The nbs career office always jokes about how smu students are only good at talking/presentation. But just look at linkedin for the career outcomes of NBS students compared to SMU students. The NBS guy will probably end up in Big4 while the SMU guy is in a bank.

But some top students I know are choosing NTU simply because they would rather start doing psych instead of waiting to claim their major. This is the key reason why people flock to NTU. If you have no worries about doing really badly in uni, the direct honors isn't really that important since you can easily qualify it if you hit a certain gpa in NUS (3.0/5.0). NTU honours degree with a really low GPA isn't seen favourably, anyway. So imo, it may not be that important for you. I'm personally leaning towards NUS simply because it's near my place, and I would like to familiarise myself with the clinical psychology department (since NUS offers a Masters). The S/U option for NUS is pretty good too, you can look at your grades and choose which subjects you don't want to count in your gpa. But in NTU, you must choose it before seeing those grades. Most of my coursemates are upset about this as well, but they're probably going to go with NTU.  As I took statistics and intro to psych in poly, amongst other psych modules (duh), I think i'm confident in getting a B and higher? But of course, I am pretty fearful that something may happen during these tests. That's the main thing that is making me doubt my choice at the moment. NUS allows you to S/U a total of 8 modules, twice the number of NTU in addition to being able to wait for results before S/Uing. If I was under the NTU system, I would have S/Ued a sociology module that I got an A for  As for ""doing psych immediately"", I don't see the rush. The two intro modules helps build up a decent foundation and there are general education modules and basket modules to clear anyway. Not to mention, the NUS system allows freedom to explore different kinds of combination.  As for whether NUS or NTU is better, there's not much difference. NUS psych don't care if NTU psych is better or not and I doubt NTU psych cares if NUS is better or not.  I know some friends who rush to clear their psych mods but for the most part, many prefer to spread it out over semesters to not overload. Nobody wants to do statistics 2, abnormal psychology, Biological Psychology, cognitive psychology, developmental psychology and social psychology in one go  The content alone is enough to kill you when you are dealing with bell curves of 70-80 regularly.",11.250222732224858

Please share your views on it as well. I really hope to get into NUS IS (I am interested in the modules offered) but no news till now so I am already prepared to face the worst scenario. I did receive an offer from SMU so I still got Plan B.  However, SMU school fees is higher than NUS by over 10k, which really makes me think whether should I take up SMU offer.  Personally, I like both SMU and NUS but school fees is really a factor that I must take into account of. Moreover, I do not have an extensive knowledge on how SMU IS curriculum. I wonder is it the same as NUS? or does it differ a lot?  So if NUS rejects me this year, I intend to reject SMU offer, and apply next year to NUS. The reason being university will no longer take into account of O Level result from Y2020 onwards. I was a PFP student and does not have an O Level result thus the long wait or possible rejection from NUS. So I would like to ask what are some of your thoughts on this?  1) Should I reject SMU this year and apply for NUS next year?  2) Do I stand a higher chance in getting accepted if I apply next year? (My CGPA is above 3.9)  Thank you everyone for reading this long post lol just wanna listen to some of your advices/opinions. Thanks! Hi! I'm in similar situation. I graduated in 2017, coming from relevant Diploma with Merit CGPA 3.95.  I'm a PFP student as well but I do not meet the maths requirement. Thus, I've been trying DA as I have good CCA records (I won several awards in local IT competitions, represented SG in international competition before, worked as freelance developer as well as startup biz as well). I got invited for DA in 2017, but didn't manage to secure a spot. Applied last year & was rejected without interview and this year is my last year of applying as I managed to disrupt from National Service (I enlisted late). I currently accepted NTU Computer Science. I'm thinking whether to take a gap year to take O Level Maths to increase my chance as well as from Y2020 onwards, O level will not be taken into consideration. However, due to my family circumstances as well as discouragement from friends I most likely will be enrolling into NTU meanwhile just praying for some good news from NUS side. Haha. Are you a male or female?  If you are a male serving NS, You can accept SMU offer first and reapply next year.  I wish you all the best and hope you will get news from NUS soon!",11.092363654808185

However, I'm not the most optimistic person about my chances since:  (1) I'm aware of how limited and competitive the opportunities for post-grad in the psych field are in SG, and priority for these opportunities would probably go to those under government (or whatever full) scholarships which I do not have, unfortunately (I guess it is thus very important for me to have excellent grades/portfolio in a said field) (2) my grades for my core mods are pretty mediocre-ish (My grades for the mods as reflected in last sem results comprises an equal number of A & B+ which is roughly average in the cohort) To be very frank tho, I'm quite fine with pursuing something in the direction of counselling/education and that's probably why I'm planning to take several counselling mods in NIE (to declare some minor in NIE) edit: for those who are choosing between the diff uni for psych, honestly, I would you urge you to consider the distance (if you stay close to NUS, just go NUS; vice versa for NTU/SMU).

2020,nanyang technological university|ntu|computer|com|infosys|information systems|analytics|smart city,Republic Polytechnic|Republic poly|rp,"   One month after Singapore upgraded its coronavirus alert level to  Dorscon Orange, the disease has since hurtled on to wreak havoc in other  countries in Asia, Europe and North America.  Singapore was briefly the country with the second most infections and  its early exposure to the disease led it up the steep learning curve  ahead of others. The brutal experience with Sars - severe acute  respiratory syndrome - in 2003 has prepared Singapore well for the  coronavirus, and it has since drawn praise from the World Health  Organisation and international experts for its effective containment  measures.  However, it would be premature and indeed foolish to celebrate, given that the coronavirus continues to lob curveballs at us.  As it is also highly contagious, containing this insidious pathogen  involves everyone and this is why effective communication is especially  vital.  Even in the span of weeks, Singapore's brush with it has been  intense, enabling it to distil crucial lessons in what has worked,  floundered or faltered in communicating during a crisis.  I identify here five lessons.  #### 1. Transparency amid turmoil  The coronavirus first reared its head in Singapore in late January to  massive confusion. There was grave uncertainty on whether it would be  as deadly as Sars. Data from China was alarming yet inconclusive, and  worse, headlines and images from Wuhan on the rising fatality rate and  high profile deaths of several doctors heightened fears. It was in such  chaotic circumstances that the Singapore Government had to exert control  and assert authority.  Its  response was one of transparency. Singapore convened regular high-level  press conferences involving its multi-ministerial task force, with  leaders giving unambiguous information about the measures being taken.  This included quarantining contacts of those infected, imposing travel  bans and advisories, testing and treating cases, and implementing  healthcare-related precautions. Channels were set up to provide the  public with reliable and timely information to counter fake news.  The transparency and regularity with which information was provided,  including hard data on the number and profile of cases and their mutual  connections, offered welcome clarity amid a fog of doubt.  #### 2. Consistency trumps confusion  Despite these efforts, confusion reigned because of the lack of clear  information on the disease. One salient point of contention was whether  to mask or not to mask.  Footage from China depicted people donning masks, as if to suggest  that masks are vital protection. In Singapore's initial weeks of  reckoning with the coronavirus, people were increasingly seen wearing  masks on trains and in crowded areas.  >**We must avoid becoming  cavalier about the disease, especially given the concern over imported  cases sparking a second wave of infections here. The fight with the  coronavirus is predicted to be long-drawn.**  However, as health experts advised, masks have limited use in  preventing infection in casual contact and pales in comparison to the  mundane practice of hand-washing. With people in Singapore beginning to  stockpile masks, setting the record straight to ensure a healthy supply  of masks for healthcare workers was critical.  To arrest this trend, consistency of messaging was key, not just in  words but also in deeds. So political leaders were never seen wearing  masks in public engagements. This was in sharp contrast to Hong Kong or  South Korea, where Chief Executive Carrie Lam and President Moon Jae-in  were often pictured with masks on.  With all-round reinforcement of the message that masking up was  neither necessary nor useful, the wearing and hoarding of masks tapered  off. Consistency of messaging thus trumped confusion.  #### 3. Partnership with community  As the coronavirus knows no geographical, cultural or demographic  boundaries, Singapore's collective resistance is only as strong as its  weakest link.  Hence, top-down communication alone cannot effectively reach  everyone. A groundswell of supportive voices rose, including celebrity  blogger Mr Brown's Kim Huat Takes The Bus videos, artist Weiman Kow's  appealing infocomics on the virus and other community initiatives that  organically emerged to strengthen the chorus around socially responsible  behaviour.  A slew of community efforts also sprung up, such as #braveheartsg  that supports front-line medical staff and Better.sg that connects  people with extra masks and sanitisers to those in need, demonstrating  the importance of partnership with the community to bring everyone on  board the fight against the virus.  #### 4. Reassurance over condescension  We cannot underestimate the adverse psychological impact of a threat  such as Covid-19 that seems simultaneously immediate, yet remote. People  feel beleaguered and desperate to protect themselves and their loved  ones, and to achieve some semblance of control over this amorphous  hazard. To ensure that public messaging hits home, an empathetic stance  that does not dismiss people's fears but acknowledges their concerns  will more greatly resonate.  Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong's two national addresses on the  coronavirus have been commendable in this regard: authoritative yet  reassuring.  Notably, the mixed response to the leaked audio of Trade and Industry  Minister Chan Chun Sing's closed-door discussion at the Singapore  Chinese Chamber of Commerce and Industry suggests that old-fashioned  common sense delivered with candour may appeal to some, but grate on  others. It is safe to say that reassurance ultimately prevails over  condescension.  #### 5. Normalcy without complacency  The final and perhaps most difficult lesson to fully grasp is how  Singapore must now build a sense of normalcy without falling prey to  complacency.  The Republic has so far managed to contain the virus to some extent  without needing to lock down the city. People have mostly gone about  business as usual, albeit with minor inconveniences such as contact  tracing measures and workplace adaptations.  However, we must avoid becoming cavalier about the disease,  especially given the concern over imported cases sparking a second wave  of infections here. The fight with the coronavirus is predicted to be  long-drawn. Even as cases stabilise in China, where the virus initiated,  infections are now rising into the thousands in Europe, the new  epicentre of the pandemic. Should cases be imported to spark a rise in  community transmissions here, we may need to consider stricter  procedures as well.  This means we must steadfastly accept that managing this disease is  part of our lived reality, proceed with life as normal, but not let up  in taking the necessary safeguards.  Inevitably, people do experience campaign fatigue over time, so  strategies must be developed to maintain awareness about the coronavirus  and refresh public messaging at appropriate intervals. This may be  achieved through crafting novel slogans, recruiting new spokesmen or  experimenting with alternative communication platforms.  Attaining normalcy without breeding complacency will be a formidable challenge, but one Singapore must strive to achieve.  In the ongoing bid to stamp out the coronavirus, we have also had to  combat fake news and herd mentality such as panic buying. While we have  yet to decisively win these battles, we can nevertheless draw valuable  insights to sharpen our communication and messaging, so as to inoculate  everyone against disease, distortions and disinformation.  **• Lim Sun Sun is professor of communication and technology  and head of humanities, arts and social sciences at the Singapore  University of Technology and Design.

2020,nanyang technological university|ntu|computer|com|infosys|information systems|analytics|smart city,Republic Polytechnic|Republic poly|rp,"Part 1      >I don't really understand how this  comparison applies to heaven since while both these hypothetical people  might never know of each other, they are capable of understanding things  like striving to be more physically fit or overcoming natural  disasters. The comparison to heaven does not work, since heaven by  definition is mean to be beyond our ability to understand.     My point is, the person on the farm might never even know what a mountain  is, just like we don't know what Heaven is like. In that sense, in the  case of the farmer, he cannot say that there is nothing else to strive  for besides survival on a farm (or striving for perfection in various  activities available to him) just because he doesn't know that mountain  exists. He does know there are places he has yet to visit, just as I  believe there is a Heaven that exists (and I certainly strive to get  there). In the same way we cannot say there is nothing to strive for in  Heaven. I believe it is very likely we do have many things to strive for  in Heaven, even if we do not know what those things might be right now.    >We can understand things in the abstract but that does not mean we can  make a ""critical judgment call"". Adam would simply have made a decision  between obeying and disobeying - however since he cannot recognize  disobeying as evil, it would be something like choosing between a circle  and triangle. A completely abstract choice without connotations of the  choice being good or bad.     Yes but in keeping with the definition of ""critical thinking"" we have both agreed upon, that is, the ability to make a decision based on two or  more contrasting positions, it is logically coherent to say that A&E have critical thinking as they made a choice between two contrasting  positions: to obey or to disobey. We did not agree that ""critical  thinking"" has to involve morality, which is good and evil. Perhapd I made a mistake using the term ""critical judgement call"" as that implies a moral choice. My bad. To further elaborate, there is a difference between making a moral judgement call such as deciding if killing is good or bad, and making a morally neutral  decision such as is sitting under the shade of a tree better than standing out in the blazing sun. I would say A&E possessed the  thinking abilities of the latter (shade or sun) prior to eating the  fruit, (and this is consistent with our agreed definition)… and they did  not possess the thinking abilities to make a moral judgement (is  killing good or bad) before eating the fruit.    >There's also no evidence in Genesis that God explains the concept of death.     Yes because there is no need to as that would add a lot of unnecessary  elaborations. I believe it is reasonable to infer that such an  explanation would have been given to A&E.    >Well,  then we go back to the actions I have mentioned earlier, like the  flood, or the killing of children. If we are keeping to just what the  scripture says, there is nothing about children ""inheriting"" the  psychopathic tendencies of their parents, or indeed just the general  concept of the children being so corrupt that they are beyond saving.  These are reasons you are providing on your own. If you are aware of  where the Bible says this specifically in relation to children who are  killed like the children of the Canaanites, or the first born of Egypt, I  would be interest to know.    First about the flood:    Genesis  6:15 The Lord saw how great the wickedness of the human race had become  on the earth, and that every inclination of the thoughts of the human  heart was only evil all the time.    Genesis  6:11  Now the earth was corrupt in God’s sight and was full of  violence. God saw how corrupt the earth had become, for all the  people on earth had corrupted their ways.    I interpret this as the world was so corrupted that it would be better  even for a child to die in childbirth than to live in such an evil  world. Even if the child was inherently good, because of how deeply  corrupted the environment was, the child would inadvertently suffer and  be corrupted. I also believe that genes can be corrupted as per the  scientific evidence that psychopathy can be inherited. Things like  tendency to anger, to murder, to steal etc. can all be passed down  through reproduction. Though these behaviors can be resisted, the genes  can be present that makes it more likely for such a person to commit an evil act.    In the case of Cannan, the genocide is a hyperbole as we read later on that even though  God commanded the Isrealites not to marry and have children with the  Cannanites, they actually do. If ""every man, woman and child"" were  killed, how could they still be around after the command to eradicate  them took place? This shows that the statement is a hyperbole. What God  is actually saying is to wipe out their way of life, which was corrupted  and evil.     ""Ok, even if not every Cannanite was killed, some innocent children must have been  killed too"". While this is true, I refer to what I said about in the  flood. Those that were killed were likely corrupted on a genetic level.  Even if the exact reasons are not given, it is implied that God does  what is necessary for our best interest, as I have mentioned in my  previous post.    Now, why  would God command the Isrealites not to marry the Cannanites and interact with them and  instead teach them the ways of a righteous life? This supports my stance  that they are corrupted on a genetic level that even their offspring  would be so inclined to evil that it would be impossible to logically ""fix"".     This is further supported by the what the Moabites and Ammonites did and how they came  to be. As I think you know, Sodom and Gomorrah were completely destroyed for their extreme evil and corruption, save for Lot and his daughters,  whom he had with his wife who was a native Sodomite. His daughters made  him drunk and raped him, and their descendants were the Moabites and Ammonites, who were constantly at war with the Isrealites and they engage in all sorts of evil including child sacrifice. As you can see, even by allowing the two descendants of one Sodomite lady to escape destruction (you could say they were half-sodomites), so much evil and violence came out of it. This provides sufficient  justification for God's divine judgement upon corrupted nations as being righteous.  It was done to prevent greater suffering and evils from happening.  Now for the first-born of Egypt, note that first-born do not refer to  babies, and it can equally be said that the people of Egypt were just as  corrupted as the Sodomites, Cannanites, or people who lived just prior  to the flood. They were doing such terrible things that the Isrealites  cried out to God for help, and God sent them many warnings and chances  to turn from their evil but they refused. The killing of the first-borns  was done to send a clear message. In that time and culture, first borns  represented those who would be the first to claim all inheritance, they  would be the ones who would have authority over all younger siblings. The message here is clear: God is serious about removing their  inheritance and authority should they still refuse to turn from their  evil ways. You can see that God sent them warnings in increasing severity, from announcements by Moses, to announcing plagues and then  sending plagues.. time and time again even with physical evidence  infront of them that their judgement is imminent they still refused to  turn from their evil. So God finally sent the greatest and strongest  message: the killing of the first borns. (Who weren't innocent either).  And even then they only momentarily allowed the Isrealites to leave, and  later regretted that decision and chased after them, resulting in their deaths.  ",14.718603787881639
2020,nanyang technological university|ntu|computer|com|infosys|information systems|analytics|smart city,Republic Polytechnic|Republic poly|rp,"   For an airline which survived the impact of the 9-11 terrorist  attacks, severe acute respiratory syndrome and the global financial  crisis, the Covid-19 outbreak might just be the straw that breaks  Singapore Airlines' (SIA) back.  With almost every major market being shut down across the world as  governments declare lockdowns, the airline has been forced to halve its  capacity.  Things are likely to get uglier in the days and weeks to come.  SIA is likely to be forced to ground more planes and furlough more staff by the end of this month.  The airline will be in deep financial distress by the end of this quarter as revenue dives and cash flow dries up.  The company typically generates between $4.1 billion and $4.4 billion  in revenue per quarter. During October to December last year, SIA's  third quarter generated $4.5 billion in revenue and had an operating  cost of $3.4 billion, excluding borrowing and leasing cost of $191  million.  UOB Kay Hian's K. Ajith estimates that SIA's revenue could decline by  $1 billion during the current final quarter. Meanwhile, about 70 per  cent of operating costs are fixed and variable costs, which are unlikely  to decline at a faster rate than revenue, he noted.  ""As such, after factoring in interest and lease payments, we expect  SIA to see operating cash burn of about $240 million in just the final  quarter, or about $80 million per month. SIA could potentially lose over  $140 million in April, given the likely steeper decline in traffic.  Though it had cash of just $1.57 billion, factoring in short-term debt  of $835 million as at end 2019 and capex (capital expenditure)  commitment of $6 billion, it would be in a precarious position by end  June, if the Government doesn't step in with additional liquidity.""  In short, a potentially painful endgame lies ahead.  SIA is not alone. The Centre for Asia Pacific Aviation reckons half  the global airlines could disappear before the year end, casualties of  Covid-19.  >**Should SIA be saved?  While a bailout is not in the Singapore DNA, SIA is a rare case. And  these are rare times. For one thing, SIA is the most visible icon of the  Singapore brand. It is also the most awarded airline in the world...**  SIA did everything right. It maintained a diversified network and  when its Chinese operations were hit (China is estimated to be around 15  per cent to 20 per cent of its market), it focused on other markets.  Any other carrier facing such a sudden disappearance of some 20 per cent  of its market would have run to its government, hat in hand, for a  bailout.  SIA's solid financial position and diversified strategy has allowed it to ride this turbulence out, till now.  As the crisis deepened, SIA cut capacity while maintaining the  connectivity needed to bring Singaporeans home from around the world.  The alternative could have been to cut capacity as dramatically as other  airlines have done, leaving passengers, especially Singaporeans and  residents, stranded.  Many SIA aircraft were flying out of Singapore to points in China,  the United Kingdom, the United States, India and elsewhere over the past  month almost half empty, but full when returning.  But none of this matters anymore.  Today the airline faces its darkest days, with some market insiders  betting it will not survive beyond the first half of the year without  financial assistance.  The company is offering no-pay leave and implementing pay cuts for  many of its 27,000 employees. But this company also indirectly supports  up to 100,000 workers down its supply chain.  Should SIA be saved?  While a bailout is not in the Singapore DNA, SIA is a rare case. And these are rare times.  For one thing, SIA is the most visible icon of the Singapore brand.  It is also the most awarded airline in the world, listed on Fortune  Magazine's 50 most admired companies for the last few years (with the  likes of Apple, Amazon and Walt Disney, and ahead of Toyota, BMW, Visa,  Nestle, Adidas and McDonald's).  Beyond this, there are very objective and dispassionate reasons for saving SIA.  Perhaps more importantly, this is the airline which almost  single-handedly built up Singapore as a major hub, and helps maintain  this status.  It has done so by optimising flight connectivity through Changi  Airport, which today remains one of Asia's most critical hub airports.  Its diversified network ensured that it brought to Singapore many folks  who would never have otherwise set foot on the island beyond Changi  Airport.  Until this crisis hit, SIA was the 15th largest airline group in the  world, serving around 140 destinations in more than 35 countries and  territories.  This expansion has been the result of a shrewd strategy of managing  capacity growth by closely tracking economic growth, market conditions  and other variables.  SIA is also well known in the industry for its rigorous approach to  choosing aircraft and aircraft orders (there is a saying within the  industry that SIA does the due diligence for other carriers, as they  tend to follow its lead in choosing planes).  And it has done all this without tax breaks, government handouts or access to cheap fuel.  Over the last 10 years, even as it was facing increasing challenges  from the Middle Eastern players and low-cost carriers, it stuck to a  clear and established growth strategy - one that focused on its  well-known premium products on one end (SIA, Silkair), and budget on the  other (Scoot). The strategy enabled it to cover all markets, from  business to leisure, to and through the Singapore hub.  Yes, SIA should be saved.  US carriers are already looking at a potential US$50 billion (S$72  billion) bailout from Washington, while Germany's Chancellor Angela  Merkel has committed to rescuing European giant Lufthansa. Other  governments such as Denmark, Taiwan, China and Australia have already  indicated they would step in for their carriers.  Perhaps for SIA, it need not be a bailout per se. Soft loans, guaranteed by the Government, might well do the job.  The concept is not new.  During the great financial crisis, the US rolled out the Troubled  Assets Relief Programme to underwrite loans to various critical  industries, including the auto sector. While the Government here has  indicated its priority is to provide support to small and medium-sized  enterprises and focus on the social front, a home-grown icon - and a  well-run one - should surely attract some love, no?  It would indeed be a sad day for Singapore if a national icon and an  internationally admired brand is allowed to disappear due to no fault of  its own.",14.45390368650528
2020,nanyang technological university|ntu|computer|com|infosys|information systems|analytics|smart city,Republic Polytechnic|Republic poly|rp,"I believe the culture being sincere in wanting to help those in need cultivated by the Singaporean society matters more than the frequently referenced ""if u give them more money means they wont take more money one la"". You get many examples of poverty stricken countries rife with corruption because of low wages but their counterparts, wealthy officials who, given an acclimatization to an indulgent lifestyle, seek even more money ala the United States, Italy, Korea. Because they are well to do, the corruption present is not as often referenced as those from less well to do countries where there is the very common stereotype of ""its okay la just bribe them so they won't take their frustrations out on you"". They are an example as to how high salaries don't necessitate lower corruption. I know you mention assist but imho the correlation between pay and corruption is not as strong as many Singaporeans may think. I believe there is a definite need to look at addressing the average sandwiched middle-class Singaporean's concerns with income inequality. When the people who society deem as more important than you also earn a much higher wage than you whilst you juggle to keep up with the increasing costs of living yet failing to be afforded most of the financial assistance available, there is a growing general feeling of ""gahmen take all my money"". To me, it's most definitely more complicated than that even though my tldr opinion is ""no gahmen is not taking ALL your money"" but the ok boomers do not develop these feelings overnight over nothing. And while we brush aside their concerns as old people coming up with bullshit to satisfy their mundane lives and answer their unfulfilled dreams and aspirations, the discontent and ill-meaning is growing. People who normally straddle the fence find solace in more extreme beliefs and ideologies. We've seen what that kind of sweeping social epidemic can do to countries like the US and the UK with society so cleanly severed into factions. And sure we are a conservative, generally diam diam country but even our bedrock of social stability will experience the consequences of the more knowledgeable minority taking the dissent of the less knowledgeable majority too lightly. And it's not to say that they are completely 100% wrong either. We know it's not a perfect system but let's not stop at just acknowledging it and telling people to shut the fuck up because it's not that bad ase we're not those unfortunate countries where people are barely surviving. As a first-world society we should strive for the status quo to not be merely to survive but for every single individual that makes up this country to thrive.

2020,nanyang technological university|ntu|computer|com|infosys|information systems|analytics|smart city,Republic Polytechnic|Republic poly|rp,"   Singapore is now in the final stages of sealing a deal for its first  next-generation stealth fighter jets, joining 12 other countries who are  set to receive or currently operate the F-35 Joint Strike Fighters.  Singapore will buy four F-35Bs and evaluate them fully before  committing to a further eight, said Defence Minister Ng Eng Hen last  Monday. The first planes will be based in the United States for training  and evaluation, with delivery expected in 2026.  The US government in January gave the green light for the sale of up  to a dozen elite stealth fighter jets and related equipment to Singapore  for US$2.75 billion (S$3.79 billion). Dr Ng told Parliament last week  that the US Congress has approved the sale as well.  The Straits Times answers some remaining questions about Singapore's F-35 acquisition.  #### Q Why does delivery take six years?  **A** Other than having to clear the backlog of orders  from other countries, defence journalist Mike Yeo said Singapore could  itself have requested the 2026 delivery date to meet its own schedules  for introducing the F-35 into the Republic of Singapore Air Force  (RSAF). ""Another reason could be the potential for further reduction in  acquisition and operating costs at that time, given the F-35 will be  firmly established by then,"" he added.  In the past, it has taken other foreign countries about five years between finalising the deal and delivery of the planes.  For instance, Belgium officially selected 34 F-35As in 2018, with the first deliveries expected in 2023.  Japan announced its decision to buy 42 F-35s in 2011 and received its first planes in 2016.  #### Q Where will the first F-35s be based?  **A** Mr Yeo, who writes for Defense News website,  believes there are three air force bases in the US that are likely  candidates: Marine Corps Air Station (MCAS) Yuma in Arizona, MCAS  Miramar in California and MCAS Beaufort in South Carolina.  The Luke Air Force Base in Arizona, where international F-35 training  is conducted and where the RSAF's Peace Carvin II F-16 detachment is  based, operates the F-35A model, noted Mr Yeo, and thus might not be  useful to the RSAF's F-35Bs.  ""The most obvious reason for basing in the US for training and  evaluation is of course the availability of training airspace and less  restrictions on it.  ""The second reason is basing in the US allows the RSAF to leverage on  the US military's experience and infrastructure in operating the  (F-35B) which would allow the RSAF to adopt the established best  practices for training and operating the F-35B and its unique  capabilities,"" he added.  The US Marine Corps is the only US armed service to also operate the  F-35B, which can take off from a shorter runway and land vertically.  #### Q Why did Singapore place a small initial order for four F-35s, with an option for eight more?  **A** Mr Ben Ho, an airpower analyst with the S.  Rajaratnam School of International Studies, said this reflected  Singapore's gradualist and evolutionary approach towards defence  acquisition.  ""The Republic's modus operandi in this regard has usually been this:  make a limited purchase, slowly ease in the capability while  fastidiously assess its effectiveness and level of integration. Only  when the F-35B has been truly bedded into the RSAF/SAF edifice would  another purchase be considered.""  He noted that while Singapore's first purchase of its F-15s in 2005  was larger with 12 aircraft and an option for eight more, that plane had  ""an enviable decades-long operational record by then"".  ""The same cannot be said of the F-35 at this stage, given that it was  first deployed for operations - with the US military - only in recent  years. This lack of a track record may be key in explaining Singapore's  cautious F-35 buy,"" he added.  Dr Ng had also suggested, in response to a question by Workers' Party  chairman and Aljunied GRC MP Sylvia Lim last Monday, that further  evaluation was important before Singapore commits to a full fleet.  The minister said Singapore was ""in no hurry"" to buy the F-35s, as  the F-15SGs and F-16s are adequate for its air defence and capabilities.  ""We (will) evaluate them fully, including all the questions that were  attributed to the F-35s including costs and maintenance, before we  decide fully on a full fleet of F-35s.""  #### Q Would Singapore still buy the ""A"" variant?  **A** While some have pointed out that the F-35B variant  is more pricey and has lower range and payload compared to the ""A""  model, analysts have said the F-35B's short takeoff and landing  capabilities could allow them to take off from temporary highway strips  should the RSAF's fixed-wing facilities be taken out.  Mr Ho of RSIS said it would make sense to consider the ""A"" model,  which is cheaper and technically less complex. For instance, it can  carry a larger payload and also strike targets from further away than  the ""B"" variant.  ""It is therefore conceivable that the F-35A could be in RSAF service  one day - and this would arguably be well into the 2030s and beyond. By  then, the cost of the F-35 should have gone down significantly and its  problems rectified.""",14.17419044770838

Where's we are all naive and less materialist. Friends, people, were the most important. Although I am not too sure how much this of this is still true, given the competition on social media nowadays for the very best photo sharing award.  But in the working world, its not a place to get hitched. It invites problems only, and most people rather focus on getting paid than getting laid. It's only acquaintance, not even friends. This is especially more complicated with the gender issues surrounding us. You wanna date? Date the girl from the office, next door. Not your office.   Dating apps are just online supermarts. You want to buy Marigold fresh milk or you prefer Australia Lactose Intolerant milk? Or you die die only want Hokkaido fresh milk? Lots of choice, can pick and choose. Everyone tend to rate themselves a high value as well. Out of a score of 10, you rate her 2. She rate herself 7. You rate yourself 8, she rate you 1. Very problematic, especially when there's no reviews. But oh wait, there's a way to market yourself... its called hobbies. Make sure you put scuba diving, snowboarding, stuff that can't be done in Singapore. It's the best way to promote your dating resume. Especially to those ladies that believes in meeting someone with the ""right chemistry"". Once you put yourself in a power of choice, you will be picking the ladies. Not them nip picking about you, and the conversion will no longer be automated bot response. Instead, they will be very proactive to know you.   It's ultimately all about playing the right game, the right way. Being divorced is surprisingly a bigger advantage than being single too. Marketing yourself as a single nice guy, is as good as putting yourself out for a good laugh. Today the world is just a mess up place. Doesn't help that people in general only want to keep moving upwards the social ladder. Singapore being a first world country in SEA ends up with a odd situation where, you have to export yourself to go higher. Or import someone to grant happiness. One important tip is to forget everything you know about true love. Love in today's standard is ultimately, whether you can afford someone's standard of living, or their dream lifestyle.   As for bulking up and improving your fitness or appearance, is really for yourself. Or whether you wanna improve your chance to get one night stand. But I can honestly tell you, that its pointless. I have work out and bulked much, posture corrected but nothing changed. I have seen similar stories too. The only difference is, you feel happier about yourself, you have a goal to well.. get more ribbed. People will treat you better though, that's a nice bonus. But then you might be wondering, what about those big bulky or fat guys with a hot girlfriend? This brings us back to the money issue. As you already know, building muscles and maintaining them requires a lot more carbs and proteins. Which essentially means better, more expensive diet which translate to ""I can afford to invest"" or ""I'm not stingy"". Ultimately, if you want to be loved, find love and be doted by a loving lady who loves everything about you. You got to \*cough\* invest in yourself first. Now you know how to play the game? Money, its all money and marketing. No love, that goes into trash bin.",14.098453206258581

When I posted the link, I just meant to tell people that in germany we have respect for your way of handling the situation. Here's the translation:  &#x200B;  ""We fight the Virus"" is a song to the melody of simon&garfunkels ""sound of silence"". There also is a corona-rap to which people dance in singapores schools: ""Wash your hands, dont touch your face -  thats how we rid the virus""  Thats what battle songs sound like in a fight where people trust each other. That is the spirit of singapore, to which president Lee Hsien Loong spoke:""Everyone has their task in this crisis, we dont leave anyone behind. That is the united singapore""  Also the peeping of the thermometers is one of the new sounds of singapore - at the airport, train stations in public buildings and stores.  There are 121 confirmed cases of sars-cov-2 in singapore - As of monday morning. But the important thing is: there are as many cured patients. All infections could be isolated very fast and the contacts of infected people could be identified using the contact-tracing management which was developed 17 years ago during the sars-epidemic.  The government says the situation is under control and the city does not need to be put under lockdown like in china, south korea or italy.  Life goes on in the city of millions. Schools, restourants and stores are open and theres not more then usual amount of masks. In asia it is more a tradition to wear masks not to protect ones self but to protect others. ""Every thing else would be a bad signal"", says the president and the singaporeans agree.  Be alaramed but dont panic. Of course the city has less going on as usual - that is also because there are fewer visitors. Besides people from china, south korea and italy also people from germany are no longer allowed to enter the country. Asia sees germany as a risk - one of the countries that didnt take corona serious, says president Lee: ""An alarming level of inactivity sayed so by the world health organization. We here in singapore tool covid19 serious from the beginning.""  Like all of the ministers and members of parlament they forfeit their salary to help the heros of corona fighting: nurses, cleaning workers, cab drivers. While that doesnt kill the virus, it does create solidarity. The virus is seen as an existential threat to the society and economy.  That's why reactions were detemined. Quarantine rules started with self quarantine at home; a precaution. Hospitals have more than 400 isolation beds ready.  Wrong doings have strict consequences: four foreigners with working permits have been removed from the country after violating the quarantine rules. They had made wrong statements about their whereabouts after travel.  Of course singapore can not be compared to other countries: Traffic can be controlled because it is an island and the border can be closed easily. And it is not a democracy in western sense.  News media is controlled by the government and report their message about corona - how to prevent infection. Also in the eyes of the west, singaporeans have an unbelievable amount of believe and trust in their government. That makes managing a crisis easier: people belive their government and do as they are told. That is also a reason why panic is something foreign in singapore.",13.75511084253329

I'm keeping my points as brief as possible to avoid a split.   > My point is, the person on the farm might never even know what a mountain is, just like we don't know what Heaven is like.  Yes, but my point is that even if we have never seen a mountain, we can conceive what a mountain is like since mountains actually exist in our world. The comparison to heaven is thus inappropriate since heaven is. according to you, by definition not conceivable.  > I would say A&E possessed the thinking abilities of the latter (shade or sun) prior to eating the fruit, (and this is consistent with our agreed definition)… and they did not possess the thinking abilities to make a moral judgement (is killing good or bad) before eating the fruit.  My proposed definition actually involves the ability to answer moral questions, so I don't think this is an agreed definition. A dog understands choosing between sitting the shade and the sun, but dogs aren't generally thought of having critical thinking skills. Your example of shade and sun is actually the point I am making about Adam - his ability to choose would be similar to that of a smart animal like a dog, but not the critical thinking skills we now have.   > Yes because there is no need to as that would add a lot of unnecessary elaborations. I believe it is reasonable to infer that such an explanation would have been given to A&E.  Well, then I think it's a bit unfair that you insist on keeping to scripture evidence but then you also feel it is okay to add to scripture to support the point you are making.   > I interpret this as the world was so corrupted that it would be better even for a child to die in childbirth than to live in such an evil world. Even if the child was inherently good, because of how deeply corrupted the environment was, the child would inadvertently suffer and be corrupted.  But the bible does not say this at all. It says that people are corrupt, but nothing about it being better for a child to die in childbirth. That's a pretty big detail that you are adding in on your own.   > I also believe that genes can be corrupted as per the scientific evidence that psychopathy can be inherited. Things like tendency to anger, to murder, to steal etc. can all be passed down through reproduction. Though these behaviors can be resisted, the genes can be present that makes it more likely for such a person to commit an evil act.  This is entirely not found in Genesis.   > ""Ok, even if not every Cannanite was killed, some innocent children must have been killed too"". While this is true, I refer to what I said about in the flood. Those that were killed were likely corrupted on a genetic level.   Again, reasons about genetics is something you are adding to the Bible.   > Now, why would God command the Isrealites not to marry the Cannanites and interact with them and instead teach them the ways of a righteous life? This supports my stance that they are corrupted on a genetic level that even their offspring would be so inclined to evil that it would be impossible to logically ""fix"".   This seems like cherry picking the parts of the Bible that suits the reason you prefer, rather than genuinely asking whether the Bible provides any good reasons in the first place.   > Now for the first-born of Egypt, note that first-born do not refer to babies,  The first born are not necessarily new babies, but it is entirely possible for babies to be first born. So within the large group of first born you will have new born babies.   > The problem here is that you are defining ""Omnipotence"" as ""the ability to do anything""… including logically impossible things. Such as ""can God create something so heavy he cannot lift it? If not he is not omnipotent"" ... That is not how I or most theists define ""Omnipotence"". I define Omnipotence as ""all powerful"", that is, having greater power than anything and everything else combined. This has nothing to do with abilities.  I'm actually not really making that old argument about logic. I too see omnipotence in the literal sense of the word - all powerful. However, a being is not all powerful if there are things which he is unable to do, or which he has no power over.  Unlike creating a square circle, God (say) causing a tsunami to kill people for no particular reason is something for which there is no logical problems for an omnipotent being.  > Once again this is a hypothetical situation that has no grounding on scripture.  Well of course we are discussing hypothetical, so why is this a criticism. Your theory on genetic transference of evil also has no evidence in scripture too, but it's an interesting point that I'm keen on discussing.   > ""A&E has become like us, all loving.""   Actually, a statement like this also refers to love as an external concept to God. If knowledge, love (etc) were all inherently tied to God because God *is* these things, then it is not logical for God to say that Adam has become like him, since that implies Adam is like God in that Adam is now knowledge, or love.   >  It was precisely because war was so rampant at that time that God saw fit to use war as a means of executing divine judgement. God uses what is readily available at that point in time, to send a message and to teach the Isrealites about His judgement.

2020,nanyang technological university|ntu|computer|com|infosys|information systems|analytics|smart city,Republic Polytechnic|Republic poly|rp,"Writer is clearly justifying the case to bail out the national carrier, but really, your former PM Lee Kuan Yew mentioned that Singapore is different, in that the system will not bailout private companies and let them fail if need to be. Of course, me citing his words doesn't mean one has to follow traditions and past ideas blindly. One has to adaptive. Then again, providing a bailout just because of national pride is senseless because when it comes to business, decisions must be firmly rooted in logic and business sense. So what it has won a lot of awards? Also, given the current unpredictability of the business landscape, this company can become an absolute blackhole, sucking endless resources until it finally dies. A national carrier is like a person's car. If the economic situation is bad, lets say an individual is struggling to keep up with mortgages and other fixed payments and unable to maintain steady cash flow, would you quickly dispose the car or change to a smaller car or take public transport? One day when situation is better, maybe i can get myself the same car or better one? Or you would maintain the same car and try to refinance to lower interest rate? It all depends on your current savings and cashflow, plus future business outlook. Anyway, there's so many other corporate options other than bailing out by infusing tax payers' money. Ask the bankers and financiers to refinance, increase existing loan tenures, take on more debts, spin offs, restructure, etc. If really the national pride of Singapore, why not consider a SIA National Pride Bond and raise one round of cash from Singaporeans?   But that's a very simplistic way of thinking but essentially an important one. If Singaporeans refused to bail the national carrier, there are certainly cascading effects at many levels for example, maintenance industry, spare parts suppliers, pull-outs of foreign air industry related companies and so on. Many more and hopefully you are able to mind-map all possibilities. Finally, whether or not SIA deserves a helping hand should be a business decision based on financials and business sense, not an emotional one. SIA should explore and exhaust all possibilities by themselves first before asking for a government bailout. I look forward to reading the future case study of SIA from Harvard.  On a personal note, I have a different perspective when it comes to choosing airlines. I don't take it because the air stewards and stewardesses are handsome, pretty and professional. Also, not because it is more comfortable. These are just bonuses for me. Rather I look at the company's maintenance standards and their procurement practice. Do they procure the best or better planes or entry level planes? Additionally, I look at the country's diplomacy because even though you could be flying through a safe zone, the nationality of the aircraft company,  plays a BIG part in a safe journey. Just for example, flying on an Israelite civilian airplane over a Hezbollah infested area. It's an extreme case but cited to bring the message across. To me, Singapore is an extremely neutral country therefore I always feel safer in a Singaporean aircraft hence the willingness to pay premium when flying long journeys. I don't really associate this advantage to SIA, rather more to the Singapore brand and its diplomacy efforts.",13.454424977459128
2020,nanyang technological university|ntu|computer|com|infosys|information systems|analytics|smart city,Republic Polytechnic|Republic poly|rp,"We haven't had an updated version for some time after the latest GES was released. Now this is one of the kinds of analysis that when interpreting the visualisation you must have in mind a few caveats. Although it is generally advised not to pick a course solely on remuneration, undoubtedly some are willing to sacrifice their happiness working in a field they later find they dislike for a higher pay, and this is their decision.   That being said, this plot is still interesting enough although with a few important things to note:  \- 10% IGP is not the minimum and may be a good measure, but A lvl Rank points does not solely determine the difficulty of entrance for some courses. Especially for courses with interviews, it is quite often the case where the real difficulty lies in passing the interview and not the RP filtering stage  \- For 85 RP courses, it is obvious that quite a few could, and will be greater than 85 RP. This is just a result of the published IGPs holding GP to be a 'C' grade, a decision made by the universities/MOE.  \- This does not take into account non-normal admission like discretionary admission scheme  \- <Honour> variants of the majors were assumed to have the same IGP. If this does not seem to make sense do point out!  \- Horizontal and Vertical lines are the major-wise mean of the courses analysed here. If your major is not here, it must have meant I could not obtain the data for either dimension.  \- One last thing to add is that starting salary is not necessarily the best measure for some majors. For one example, accountancy is known to have lower starting pay but more well-known for its increment/progression. So do take note of this.  \- Business Analytics is from Computing but it is a Bachelor of Science  \- the usual problems for GES in general still apply, like reporting bias, sample size etc. (although all here are >30, but that's still not significantly big).  \- Decided to do for gross starting remuneration but basic could also hold some insights.  \- For obvious reasons, there is a 3/4 year lag between the latest batch(IGP) and the batch whose GES was considered.  &#x200B;  Data was taken from MOE at: [https://www.moe.gov.sg/docs/default-source/document/education/post-secondary/files/web-publication-nus-ges-2019.pdf](https://www.moe.gov.sg/docs/default-source/document/education/post-secondary/files/web-publication-nus-ges-2019.pdf)  Some footnotes copy and pasted from their report:  ""  6.

2020,nanyang technological university|ntu|computer|com|infosys|information systems|analytics|smart city,Singapore polytechnic|singapore poly|sp,"   One month after Singapore upgraded its coronavirus alert level to  Dorscon Orange, the disease has since hurtled on to wreak havoc in other  countries in Asia, Europe and North America.  Singapore was briefly the country with the second most infections and  its early exposure to the disease led it up the steep learning curve  ahead of others. The brutal experience with Sars - severe acute  respiratory syndrome - in 2003 has prepared Singapore well for the  coronavirus, and it has since drawn praise from the World Health  Organisation and international experts for its effective containment  measures.  However, it would be premature and indeed foolish to celebrate, given that the coronavirus continues to lob curveballs at us.  As it is also highly contagious, containing this insidious pathogen  involves everyone and this is why effective communication is especially  vital.  Even in the span of weeks, Singapore's brush with it has been  intense, enabling it to distil crucial lessons in what has worked,  floundered or faltered in communicating during a crisis.  I identify here five lessons.  #### 1. Transparency amid turmoil  The coronavirus first reared its head in Singapore in late January to  massive confusion. There was grave uncertainty on whether it would be  as deadly as Sars. Data from China was alarming yet inconclusive, and  worse, headlines and images from Wuhan on the rising fatality rate and  high profile deaths of several doctors heightened fears. It was in such  chaotic circumstances that the Singapore Government had to exert control  and assert authority.  Its  response was one of transparency. Singapore convened regular high-level  press conferences involving its multi-ministerial task force, with  leaders giving unambiguous information about the measures being taken.  This included quarantining contacts of those infected, imposing travel  bans and advisories, testing and treating cases, and implementing  healthcare-related precautions. Channels were set up to provide the  public with reliable and timely information to counter fake news.  The transparency and regularity with which information was provided,  including hard data on the number and profile of cases and their mutual  connections, offered welcome clarity amid a fog of doubt.  #### 2. Consistency trumps confusion  Despite these efforts, confusion reigned because of the lack of clear  information on the disease. One salient point of contention was whether  to mask or not to mask.  Footage from China depicted people donning masks, as if to suggest  that masks are vital protection. In Singapore's initial weeks of  reckoning with the coronavirus, people were increasingly seen wearing  masks on trains and in crowded areas.  >**We must avoid becoming  cavalier about the disease, especially given the concern over imported  cases sparking a second wave of infections here. The fight with the  coronavirus is predicted to be long-drawn.**  However, as health experts advised, masks have limited use in  preventing infection in casual contact and pales in comparison to the  mundane practice of hand-washing. With people in Singapore beginning to  stockpile masks, setting the record straight to ensure a healthy supply  of masks for healthcare workers was critical.  To arrest this trend, consistency of messaging was key, not just in  words but also in deeds. So political leaders were never seen wearing  masks in public engagements. This was in sharp contrast to Hong Kong or  South Korea, where Chief Executive Carrie Lam and President Moon Jae-in  were often pictured with masks on.  With all-round reinforcement of the message that masking up was  neither necessary nor useful, the wearing and hoarding of masks tapered  off. Consistency of messaging thus trumped confusion.  #### 3. Partnership with community  As the coronavirus knows no geographical, cultural or demographic  boundaries, Singapore's collective resistance is only as strong as its  weakest link.  Hence, top-down communication alone cannot effectively reach  everyone. A groundswell of supportive voices rose, including celebrity  blogger Mr Brown's Kim Huat Takes The Bus videos, artist Weiman Kow's  appealing infocomics on the virus and other community initiatives that  organically emerged to strengthen the chorus around socially responsible  behaviour.  A slew of community efforts also sprung up, such as #braveheartsg  that supports front-line medical staff and Better.sg that connects  people with extra masks and sanitisers to those in need, demonstrating  the importance of partnership with the community to bring everyone on  board the fight against the virus.  #### 4. Reassurance over condescension  We cannot underestimate the adverse psychological impact of a threat  such as Covid-19 that seems simultaneously immediate, yet remote. People  feel beleaguered and desperate to protect themselves and their loved  ones, and to achieve some semblance of control over this amorphous  hazard. To ensure that public messaging hits home, an empathetic stance  that does not dismiss people's fears but acknowledges their concerns  will more greatly resonate.  Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong's two national addresses on the  coronavirus have been commendable in this regard: authoritative yet  reassuring.  Notably, the mixed response to the leaked audio of Trade and Industry  Minister Chan Chun Sing's closed-door discussion at the Singapore  Chinese Chamber of Commerce and Industry suggests that old-fashioned  common sense delivered with candour may appeal to some, but grate on  others. It is safe to say that reassurance ultimately prevails over  condescension.  #### 5. Normalcy without complacency  The final and perhaps most difficult lesson to fully grasp is how  Singapore must now build a sense of normalcy without falling prey to  complacency.  The Republic has so far managed to contain the virus to some extent  without needing to lock down the city. People have mostly gone about  business as usual, albeit with minor inconveniences such as contact  tracing measures and workplace adaptations.  However, we must avoid becoming cavalier about the disease,  especially given the concern over imported cases sparking a second wave  of infections here. The fight with the coronavirus is predicted to be  long-drawn. Even as cases stabilise in China, where the virus initiated,  infections are now rising into the thousands in Europe, the new  epicentre of the pandemic. Should cases be imported to spark a rise in  community transmissions here, we may need to consider stricter  procedures as well.  This means we must steadfastly accept that managing this disease is  part of our lived reality, proceed with life as normal, but not let up  in taking the necessary safeguards.  Inevitably, people do experience campaign fatigue over time, so  strategies must be developed to maintain awareness about the coronavirus  and refresh public messaging at appropriate intervals. This may be  achieved through crafting novel slogans, recruiting new spokesmen or  experimenting with alternative communication platforms.  Attaining normalcy without breeding complacency will be a formidable challenge, but one Singapore must strive to achieve.  In the ongoing bid to stamp out the coronavirus, we have also had to  combat fake news and herd mentality such as panic buying. While we have  yet to decisively win these battles, we can nevertheless draw valuable  insights to sharpen our communication and messaging, so as to inoculate  everyone against disease, distortions and disinformation.  **• Lim Sun Sun is professor of communication and technology  and head of humanities, arts and social sciences at the Singapore  University of Technology and Design.

2020,nanyang technological university|ntu|computer|com|infosys|information systems|analytics|smart city,Singapore polytechnic|singapore poly|sp,"I’m the only daughter in my family, and the youngest. My parents are pretty toxic, good at gaslighting, and pretty controlling too.   -school- Ever since I was young I wasn’t allowed to stay over at people’s houses because my parents were scared that something would happen to me. They didn’t want to let me study overseas despite my dream to, and after they didn’t allow me to take the SAT gaslighted me by talking about how much I could’ve earned working there (tsk).   Then there was the constant comparisons to other children - how they were doing better in their DIFFERENT SCHOOLS with DIFFERENT PAPERS, how they got scholarships and all these opportunities with ministers and idk what. I mean, idk about my parents but most of those kids either ended up not doing as well as me (which they never mentioned), or are dead because they committed suicide.   I think one of the worst things was that whenever I fell out with my friends by no fault of my own / got bullied and ostracised super badly (still have that trauma until now which led to anxiety, depression, low self esteem and major trust issues) they would blame me for being unlikeable or having a “personality problem”. It’s really not a great feeling when you feel like you have nobody and your bloody parents can’t even be sensitive and be there for you. My mum would always say I was temperamental and should be “gentle” and more ladylike - just to clarify I don’t really think I’m over reactive I’m just outspoken about wanting to be treated right - which I’ve come to realise, does not connote to being difficult. It just means I know where I stand and I stay there. I confided this in them once and not only did my mum play the victim, my dad makes jokes about how I shouldn’t “do something regrettable” because they raised me up so well. They also don’t believe I can have mental problems because they “raised me well”.  - as a woman -  Even earlier today they shamed me for wearing what they considered a “revealing” top and my mum said that my way of dressing would prevent me from finding good honest boys and encourage harassment - she’s from the school of victim blaming where the short skirt attracts wrongdoing but it would still be the girl’s fault. They always wanted me to dress more “elegantly” etc. I mean, I’m not going to wear a turtleneck and long pants in 40 degree weather, thank you.   Going out clubbing freaks them out so much - they will literally blast my phone so many times in the night to see whether I’m alive / not raped / kidnapped somewhere / dead and basically tell me they’re losing sleep cos I’m not home. I’m a very responsible person - never been home drunk (don’t like the feeling), never stayed over without telling them it was with a friend I trusted, never went out with people I don’t trust, really nothing to raise suspicions at all. They’re suspicious of Grab drivers so they always want to pick me up - if I say yes, they will blast my phone every 10 minutes to see if I was ready to go home even if I had told them what time I’d be done.   I wasn’t allowed to pierce my ears until I forced them to when I was 18.   They were mad I blocked them from my instagram. But my mum would check my likes and ask me about people who didn’t like my post and whether it was cos my “disagreeable” ass fell out with them. She would look at my posts and criticise my appearance etc. There was a big argument once I blocked her. She called me an ungrateful child and told me she was “very hurt” by my selfish actions. I want to live my life?   - love life -   My parents are traditional people who think I should find a deferential rich boy. Because everybody walks around with their net worth printed on their foreheads right?   I tried to be that for them, but came to realise you can’t help who you’re attracted to. I guess unfortunately for them I was attracted to my boyfriend who is from a single parent family, not of “good financial standing”, and in their opinion “ugly”. After one month of being together I told them about him, and for that month at any point in time they made sure to mention how poor, ugly and “mentally scarred” he was from his parent’s divorce. It put a lot of stress on us and we took a break for a while. We’re back together now, but I haven’t told them. None of us deserve to be subject to judgment for things we can’t control. I don’t plan to tell them anything until I am independent.  I think I learnt this too from how they ruined my brother’s relationship - they’d let his gf come to dinner and proceed to constantly trash her behind her back in front of my brother or the rest of us even. It was pretty two faced and weird. Of course, no sex before marriage. Whatever.   - where I’m at now -  I’ve been safely staying away from them by staying in my uni hostel. They are very unhappy about this, but my insistence won. My uni hostel isn’t far from home, which made them feel it was a waste of money.   I think coming to uni and being out from their influence more made me realise I was being gaslighted and emotionally abused (even if they don’t recognise it). I’ve come to draw a lot more boundaries regarding my life and learnt to stand my ground. Not to say the comments don’t sting, and I’ve still got a few more years of big stings and tears to go no doubt, but I’ve got a really good network that understands my struggle. My boyfriend has been with my the whole way through my journey and has been really understanding and also opened me up to what was happening to me.   I’ve come to really address my anxiety and depression, and although I do get the occasional panic attacks and am no perfect person by any means, I think I’ve come to accept myself a lot more than I used to. More importantly, I am a happier person. A lot of stress keeping things from them, but nevertheless so much happier.   I can’t wait to work my ass off and move out permanently.",17.141324104751565
2020,nanyang technological university|ntu|computer|com|infosys|information systems|analytics|smart city,Singapore polytechnic|singapore poly|sp,"I'm in a US city which has not (yet) been hit hard. Have not been sleeping well these few days, so quality of writing will be quite cui. All institutes of higher learning or schools for that matter have been ordered to move classes online. Restaurants only allow you to dabao food, not eat in. Everyone is advised to stay in as far as possible. I've not been out for almost a week, and only left once in the past 12 days to stock up on even more food (I've got at least 1-2 months of supplies).  It's a tough situation for us students. The general opinion here is very mixed. To start off, the term \`student' is quite heavily overloaded, since the considerations of undergrads, masters, exchange, PhD students are all very different. For exchange students or students who are graduating this semester, coming back is almost certainly the right thing to do, *unless* you have a job lined up after graduation. That one is a bit of a grey area, especially if you chose to do your degree in the states precisely because you wanted a job there.  For PhD students, research is pretty much our job (no holidays btw). If you have to work in a physical lab, then things could get sticky. Fortunately, I study CS and hence am lucky enough to be able to pretty much work from home without any disruption. At any rate, that was pretty much my life before the virus outbreak. Advisors are generally very sympathetic and are willing to pay (sometimes out of their own pocket) for students to buy webcams/tablets etc. Things vary from person to person, but I can't imagine advisors turning down requests to fly home in a time like this. That said, bear in mind its not quite right for us to ""just stop playing and leave"", since that is akin to quitting your *job* without notice.  For most of us, the considerations are  1. Chance of contracting the virus while staying vs. Risk of contracting it en-route home. This is hard to judge, since most of us are well prepared to hunker down for months. Contrast this with going home, which means going through Newark or SFO, two huge danger zones. 2. Quality of health services (taking into account possible overload of health services) vs. that in Singapore. Here, SG wins hands down. 3. Logistical issues. How do we re-enter after (and if) this whole thing dies down? How will our visas be handled? Typically student visas expire after several months of not re-entering the states. Will we ever be able to graduate? 4. Productivity. WFH sounds great, especially for nerdy, introverted CS people. (I can literally root myself in my comfortable gaming chair all day!) But in reality, my productivity has never been lower. Not only is there this constant barrage of CV-related news (I follow the situation in both SG and US), the recent advisories for the past few days made me lose even more sleep. It's really difficult to concentrate when you keep second guessing your own decisions, which explains why I'm on reddit now. Maybe if I flew back, I'd lose less sleep and actually be more productive.  IF the US had stayed on the same course as it was a week ago, then leaving is obviously the better option. But my state and city have at least *some* primitive measures to flatten the curve,  so that makes the decision a bit tougher.  Addendum: Also, spoke to my Chinese peers and their concerns are generally the same, though (3) is obviously a more major one.  Edits: grammar, writing  Edit2: I also want to add that MFA, MOE etc have been extremely helpful to all of us during this period, especially with procedures and what to expect if we chose to go back. Singaporeans get updates every few hours, which are disseminated through whatsapp/Telegram chats. Would want to thank them from the bottom of my heart for their services in these tough times, hopefully one of them sees this.",14.892196338558206
2020,nanyang technological university|ntu|computer|com|infosys|information systems|analytics|smart city,Singapore polytechnic|singapore poly|sp,"Part 1      >I don't really understand how this  comparison applies to heaven since while both these hypothetical people  might never know of each other, they are capable of understanding things  like striving to be more physically fit or overcoming natural  disasters. The comparison to heaven does not work, since heaven by  definition is mean to be beyond our ability to understand.     My point is, the person on the farm might never even know what a mountain  is, just like we don't know what Heaven is like. In that sense, in the  case of the farmer, he cannot say that there is nothing else to strive  for besides survival on a farm (or striving for perfection in various  activities available to him) just because he doesn't know that mountain  exists. He does know there are places he has yet to visit, just as I  believe there is a Heaven that exists (and I certainly strive to get  there). In the same way we cannot say there is nothing to strive for in  Heaven. I believe it is very likely we do have many things to strive for  in Heaven, even if we do not know what those things might be right now.    >We can understand things in the abstract but that does not mean we can  make a ""critical judgment call"". Adam would simply have made a decision  between obeying and disobeying - however since he cannot recognize  disobeying as evil, it would be something like choosing between a circle  and triangle. A completely abstract choice without connotations of the  choice being good or bad.     Yes but in keeping with the definition of ""critical thinking"" we have both agreed upon, that is, the ability to make a decision based on two or  more contrasting positions, it is logically coherent to say that A&E have critical thinking as they made a choice between two contrasting  positions: to obey or to disobey. We did not agree that ""critical  thinking"" has to involve morality, which is good and evil. Perhapd I made a mistake using the term ""critical judgement call"" as that implies a moral choice. My bad. To further elaborate, there is a difference between making a moral judgement call such as deciding if killing is good or bad, and making a morally neutral  decision such as is sitting under the shade of a tree better than standing out in the blazing sun. I would say A&E possessed the  thinking abilities of the latter (shade or sun) prior to eating the  fruit, (and this is consistent with our agreed definition)… and they did  not possess the thinking abilities to make a moral judgement (is  killing good or bad) before eating the fruit.    >There's also no evidence in Genesis that God explains the concept of death.     Yes because there is no need to as that would add a lot of unnecessary  elaborations. I believe it is reasonable to infer that such an  explanation would have been given to A&E.    >Well,  then we go back to the actions I have mentioned earlier, like the  flood, or the killing of children. If we are keeping to just what the  scripture says, there is nothing about children ""inheriting"" the  psychopathic tendencies of their parents, or indeed just the general  concept of the children being so corrupt that they are beyond saving.  These are reasons you are providing on your own. If you are aware of  where the Bible says this specifically in relation to children who are  killed like the children of the Canaanites, or the first born of Egypt, I  would be interest to know.    First about the flood:    Genesis  6:15 The Lord saw how great the wickedness of the human race had become  on the earth, and that every inclination of the thoughts of the human  heart was only evil all the time.    Genesis  6:11  Now the earth was corrupt in God’s sight and was full of  violence. God saw how corrupt the earth had become, for all the  people on earth had corrupted their ways.    I interpret this as the world was so corrupted that it would be better  even for a child to die in childbirth than to live in such an evil  world. Even if the child was inherently good, because of how deeply  corrupted the environment was, the child would inadvertently suffer and  be corrupted. I also believe that genes can be corrupted as per the  scientific evidence that psychopathy can be inherited. Things like  tendency to anger, to murder, to steal etc. can all be passed down  through reproduction. Though these behaviors can be resisted, the genes  can be present that makes it more likely for such a person to commit an evil act.    In the case of Cannan, the genocide is a hyperbole as we read later on that even though  God commanded the Isrealites not to marry and have children with the  Cannanites, they actually do. If ""every man, woman and child"" were  killed, how could they still be around after the command to eradicate  them took place? This shows that the statement is a hyperbole. What God  is actually saying is to wipe out their way of life, which was corrupted  and evil.     ""Ok, even if not every Cannanite was killed, some innocent children must have been  killed too"". While this is true, I refer to what I said about in the  flood. Those that were killed were likely corrupted on a genetic level.  Even if the exact reasons are not given, it is implied that God does  what is necessary for our best interest, as I have mentioned in my  previous post.    Now, why  would God command the Isrealites not to marry the Cannanites and interact with them and  instead teach them the ways of a righteous life? This supports my stance  that they are corrupted on a genetic level that even their offspring  would be so inclined to evil that it would be impossible to logically ""fix"".     This is further supported by the what the Moabites and Ammonites did and how they came  to be. As I think you know, Sodom and Gomorrah were completely destroyed for their extreme evil and corruption, save for Lot and his daughters,  whom he had with his wife who was a native Sodomite. His daughters made  him drunk and raped him, and their descendants were the Moabites and Ammonites, who were constantly at war with the Isrealites and they engage in all sorts of evil including child sacrifice. As you can see, even by allowing the two descendants of one Sodomite lady to escape destruction (you could say they were half-sodomites), so much evil and violence came out of it. This provides sufficient  justification for God's divine judgement upon corrupted nations as being righteous.  It was done to prevent greater suffering and evils from happening.  Now for the first-born of Egypt, note that first-born do not refer to  babies, and it can equally be said that the people of Egypt were just as  corrupted as the Sodomites, Cannanites, or people who lived just prior  to the flood. They were doing such terrible things that the Isrealites  cried out to God for help, and God sent them many warnings and chances  to turn from their evil but they refused. The killing of the first-borns  was done to send a clear message. In that time and culture, first borns  represented those who would be the first to claim all inheritance, they  would be the ones who would have authority over all younger siblings. The message here is clear: God is serious about removing their  inheritance and authority should they still refuse to turn from their  evil ways. You can see that God sent them warnings in increasing severity, from announcements by Moses, to announcing plagues and then  sending plagues.. time and time again even with physical evidence  infront of them that their judgement is imminent they still refused to  turn from their evil. So God finally sent the greatest and strongest  message: the killing of the first borns. (Who weren't innocent either).  And even then they only momentarily allowed the Isrealites to leave, and  later regretted that decision and chased after them, resulting in their deaths.  ",14.721777122653254
2020,nanyang technological university|ntu|computer|com|infosys|information systems|analytics|smart city,Singapore polytechnic|singapore poly|sp,"I believe the culture being sincere in wanting to help those in need cultivated by the Singaporean society matters more than the frequently referenced ""if u give them more money means they wont take more money one la"". You get many examples of poverty stricken countries rife with corruption because of low wages but their counterparts, wealthy officials who, given an acclimatization to an indulgent lifestyle, seek even more money ala the United States, Italy, Korea. Because they are well to do, the corruption present is not as often referenced as those from less well to do countries where there is the very common stereotype of ""its okay la just bribe them so they won't take their frustrations out on you"". They are an example as to how high salaries don't necessitate lower corruption. I know you mention assist but imho the correlation between pay and corruption is not as strong as many Singaporeans may think. I believe there is a definite need to look at addressing the average sandwiched middle-class Singaporean's concerns with income inequality. When the people who society deem as more important than you also earn a much higher wage than you whilst you juggle to keep up with the increasing costs of living yet failing to be afforded most of the financial assistance available, there is a growing general feeling of ""gahmen take all my money"". To me, it's most definitely more complicated than that even though my tldr opinion is ""no gahmen is not taking ALL your money"" but the ok boomers do not develop these feelings overnight over nothing. And while we brush aside their concerns as old people coming up with bullshit to satisfy their mundane lives and answer their unfulfilled dreams and aspirations, the discontent and ill-meaning is growing. People who normally straddle the fence find solace in more extreme beliefs and ideologies. We've seen what that kind of sweeping social epidemic can do to countries like the US and the UK with society so cleanly severed into factions. And sure we are a conservative, generally diam diam country but even our bedrock of social stability will experience the consequences of the more knowledgeable minority taking the dissent of the less knowledgeable majority too lightly. And it's not to say that they are completely 100% wrong either. We know it's not a perfect system but let's not stop at just acknowledging it and telling people to shut the fuck up because it's not that bad ase we're not those unfortunate countries where people are barely surviving. As a first-world society we should strive for the status quo to not be merely to survive but for every single individual that makes up this country to thrive.

2020,nanyang technological university|ntu|computer|com|infosys|information systems|analytics|smart city,Singapore polytechnic|singapore poly|sp,"   For an airline which survived the impact of the 9-11 terrorist  attacks, severe acute respiratory syndrome and the global financial  crisis, the Covid-19 outbreak might just be the straw that breaks  Singapore Airlines' (SIA) back.  With almost every major market being shut down across the world as  governments declare lockdowns, the airline has been forced to halve its  capacity.  Things are likely to get uglier in the days and weeks to come.  SIA is likely to be forced to ground more planes and furlough more staff by the end of this month.  The airline will be in deep financial distress by the end of this quarter as revenue dives and cash flow dries up.  The company typically generates between $4.1 billion and $4.4 billion  in revenue per quarter. During October to December last year, SIA's  third quarter generated $4.5 billion in revenue and had an operating  cost of $3.4 billion, excluding borrowing and leasing cost of $191  million.  UOB Kay Hian's K. Ajith estimates that SIA's revenue could decline by  $1 billion during the current final quarter. Meanwhile, about 70 per  cent of operating costs are fixed and variable costs, which are unlikely  to decline at a faster rate than revenue, he noted.  ""As such, after factoring in interest and lease payments, we expect  SIA to see operating cash burn of about $240 million in just the final  quarter, or about $80 million per month. SIA could potentially lose over  $140 million in April, given the likely steeper decline in traffic.  Though it had cash of just $1.57 billion, factoring in short-term debt  of $835 million as at end 2019 and capex (capital expenditure)  commitment of $6 billion, it would be in a precarious position by end  June, if the Government doesn't step in with additional liquidity.""  In short, a potentially painful endgame lies ahead.  SIA is not alone. The Centre for Asia Pacific Aviation reckons half  the global airlines could disappear before the year end, casualties of  Covid-19.  >**Should SIA be saved?  While a bailout is not in the Singapore DNA, SIA is a rare case. And  these are rare times. For one thing, SIA is the most visible icon of the  Singapore brand. It is also the most awarded airline in the world...**  SIA did everything right. It maintained a diversified network and  when its Chinese operations were hit (China is estimated to be around 15  per cent to 20 per cent of its market), it focused on other markets.  Any other carrier facing such a sudden disappearance of some 20 per cent  of its market would have run to its government, hat in hand, for a  bailout.  SIA's solid financial position and diversified strategy has allowed it to ride this turbulence out, till now.  As the crisis deepened, SIA cut capacity while maintaining the  connectivity needed to bring Singaporeans home from around the world.  The alternative could have been to cut capacity as dramatically as other  airlines have done, leaving passengers, especially Singaporeans and  residents, stranded.  Many SIA aircraft were flying out of Singapore to points in China,  the United Kingdom, the United States, India and elsewhere over the past  month almost half empty, but full when returning.  But none of this matters anymore.  Today the airline faces its darkest days, with some market insiders  betting it will not survive beyond the first half of the year without  financial assistance.  The company is offering no-pay leave and implementing pay cuts for  many of its 27,000 employees. But this company also indirectly supports  up to 100,000 workers down its supply chain.  Should SIA be saved?  While a bailout is not in the Singapore DNA, SIA is a rare case. And these are rare times.  For one thing, SIA is the most visible icon of the Singapore brand.  It is also the most awarded airline in the world, listed on Fortune  Magazine's 50 most admired companies for the last few years (with the  likes of Apple, Amazon and Walt Disney, and ahead of Toyota, BMW, Visa,  Nestle, Adidas and McDonald's).  Beyond this, there are very objective and dispassionate reasons for saving SIA.  Perhaps more importantly, this is the airline which almost  single-handedly built up Singapore as a major hub, and helps maintain  this status.  It has done so by optimising flight connectivity through Changi  Airport, which today remains one of Asia's most critical hub airports.  Its diversified network ensured that it brought to Singapore many folks  who would never have otherwise set foot on the island beyond Changi  Airport.  Until this crisis hit, SIA was the 15th largest airline group in the  world, serving around 140 destinations in more than 35 countries and  territories.  This expansion has been the result of a shrewd strategy of managing  capacity growth by closely tracking economic growth, market conditions  and other variables.  SIA is also well known in the industry for its rigorous approach to  choosing aircraft and aircraft orders (there is a saying within the  industry that SIA does the due diligence for other carriers, as they  tend to follow its lead in choosing planes).  And it has done all this without tax breaks, government handouts or access to cheap fuel.  Over the last 10 years, even as it was facing increasing challenges  from the Middle Eastern players and low-cost carriers, it stuck to a  clear and established growth strategy - one that focused on its  well-known premium products on one end (SIA, Silkair), and budget on the  other (Scoot). The strategy enabled it to cover all markets, from  business to leisure, to and through the Singapore hub.  Yes, SIA should be saved.  US carriers are already looking at a potential US$50 billion (S$72  billion) bailout from Washington, while Germany's Chancellor Angela  Merkel has committed to rescuing European giant Lufthansa. Other  governments such as Denmark, Taiwan, China and Australia have already  indicated they would step in for their carriers.  Perhaps for SIA, it need not be a bailout per se. Soft loans, guaranteed by the Government, might well do the job.  The concept is not new.  During the great financial crisis, the US rolled out the Troubled  Assets Relief Programme to underwrite loans to various critical  industries, including the auto sector. While the Government here has  indicated its priority is to provide support to small and medium-sized  enterprises and focus on the social front, a home-grown icon - and a  well-run one - should surely attract some love, no?  It would indeed be a sad day for Singapore if a national icon and an  internationally admired brand is allowed to disappear due to no fault of  its own.",14.295834316361255
2020,nanyang technological university|ntu|computer|com|infosys|information systems|analytics|smart city,Singapore polytechnic|singapore poly|sp,"I had my fair share of rejection and unexpected endings, but I can tell you that the best time to find someone who will actually dedicate themselves to the concept of ""love"" and plan out a future together is during school days. Where's we are all naive and less materialist. Friends, people, were the most important. Although I am not too sure how much this of this is still true, given the competition on social media nowadays for the very best photo sharing award.  But in the working world, its not a place to get hitched. It invites problems only, and most people rather focus on getting paid than getting laid. It's only acquaintance, not even friends. This is especially more complicated with the gender issues surrounding us. You wanna date? Date the girl from the office, next door. Not your office.   Dating apps are just online supermarts. You want to buy Marigold fresh milk or you prefer Australia Lactose Intolerant milk? Or you die die only want Hokkaido fresh milk? Lots of choice, can pick and choose. Everyone tend to rate themselves a high value as well. Out of a score of 10, you rate her 2. She rate herself 7. You rate yourself 8, she rate you 1. Very problematic, especially when there's no reviews. But oh wait, there's a way to market yourself... its called hobbies. Make sure you put scuba diving, snowboarding, stuff that can't be done in Singapore. It's the best way to promote your dating resume. Especially to those ladies that believes in meeting someone with the ""right chemistry"". Once you put yourself in a power of choice, you will be picking the ladies. Not them nip picking about you, and the conversion will no longer be automated bot response. Instead, they will be very proactive to know you.   It's ultimately all about playing the right game, the right way. Being divorced is surprisingly a bigger advantage than being single too. Marketing yourself as a single nice guy, is as good as putting yourself out for a good laugh. Today the world is just a mess up place. Doesn't help that people in general only want to keep moving upwards the social ladder. Singapore being a first world country in SEA ends up with a odd situation where, you have to export yourself to go higher. Or import someone to grant happiness. One important tip is to forget everything you know about true love. Love in today's standard is ultimately, whether you can afford someone's standard of living, or their dream lifestyle.   As for bulking up and improving your fitness or appearance, is really for yourself. Or whether you wanna improve your chance to get one night stand. But I can honestly tell you, that its pointless. I have work out and bulked much, posture corrected but nothing changed. I have seen similar stories too. The only difference is, you feel happier about yourself, you have a goal to well.. get more ribbed. People will treat you better though, that's a nice bonus. But then you might be wondering, what about those big bulky or fat guys with a hot girlfriend? This brings us back to the money issue. As you already know, building muscles and maintaining them requires a lot more carbs and proteins. Which essentially means better, more expensive diet which translate to ""I can afford to invest"" or ""I'm not stingy"". Ultimately, if you want to be loved, find love and be doted by a loving lady who loves everything about you. You got to \*cough\* invest in yourself first. Now you know how to play the game? Money, its all money and marketing. No love, that goes into trash bin.",14.155340026957926
2020,nanyang technological university|ntu|computer|com|infosys|information systems|analytics|smart city,Singapore polytechnic|singapore poly|sp," Rather than being controlling, my parents are always overly worried about me because I'm the only child.  During pri sch, mom checked my bag everyday, see if there's anything out of the ordinary, checked my wallet and ask me what I had spent on. I had to try and recall everything.  I had to tell her my whereabouts after school (this happened until Poly or even after I began working). After every few hours, she'd text me or call me and ask where I am. (Also, she knew who my friends were, had their numbers and all. And the no dating thing is the same with me).  During compulsory sch camps, they had no choice but to let me go, but told me that I had to call them every night. I didn't because I couldn't. My mom even said she couldn't sleep a wink when I didn't call.  I have never been overseas until now. Not even across the borders (in my mid 20s. Yes, embarrassing. People laugh at me for that.) I can now, but I'm just lazy.  During sec sch, even the compulsory overseas trip, my teacher had to call my dad to convince him. But in the end, she was convinced by him instead... And I'll remember what my dad said when I brought up the trip excitedly forever, ""Don't even think about it."" My mom only said, ""It can't be helped."" But I know that she was secretly happy about it.  They wouldn't let me do anything by myself. Not housework, not cooking. But later in my teens, they liked complaining how pampered I am.  Whenever I did something wrong, like not reporting my whereabouts often enough, or just anything that they didn't like, my mom would give me the silent treatment for weeks. That severely lowered my self-esteem. I felt left out, worthless, and unwanted as a child. I have 0 self-esteem. I wanted to take my own life as a child (now I just laugh at how childish it is).  There are more. Basically, they are overly worried about me. But are slowly learning to let things go. This was how I did it.  I told them how if I had to tell them about my whereabouts every time, I'd rather stay home. If they aren't letting me do any work on my own, I'd rather try nothing at all. If they aren't letting me go overseas, fine. I'll be a country bumpkin for the rest of my life. That was how rebellious I am. I get laughed at, but most people are going to criticize their parenting style. I spelled it out to them clearly. If they keep worrying, then I'd rather DO NOTHING and stay in their sight, be a bum until I annoy them (of course it didn't happen). I told them everything calmly. And I said I hated silent treatment because of how manipulative and abusive it is. My mom gave me the silent treatment less frequently as a result, and they started letting things go slowly. I started to be able to breathe then.  But now, getting into a [r/s](https://www.reddit.com/r/s/) is sure a whole new challenge. I was given the silent treatment 4 times in a row within 2 months just because I got a little too intimate with my partner (nothing more than hugging), and I went to another room to talk to my partner over the phone (so she doesn't hear me speak loveydovey). She began mentioning how I'd pick my new partner over her and how I'd throw her away in a heartbeat (which is stupid).  The list goes on. She told me not to go to weddings (I was invited), because they'd make me drunk(?) She said I can't go to my partner's place/can't be alone with him in a private space. Lately, she gave me another silent treatment for hugging my partner. I know, ridiculous. She also began suspecting if I actually gave away my virginity (not true). Ridiculous, yes. So I told her, I don't think I did anything wrong. I can end my [r/s](https://www.reddit.com/r/s/) right now if she thinks it's appropriate. I won't bother finding another for the rest of my life if she just wants me all to herself. I ended it calmly with, if she can't trust me at all, I'll just follow her wherever she goes. And by everywhere, I really mean it. A bird stuck in a cage dies after the owner loses his/her life.  This is still an ongoing thing. It's another obstacle to go through. I'm not encouraging you to be rebellious like me. But talk it out, let your parents know what they are doing to you and how others would think when they see this. I think parents are always learning to be parents, and this can be taught by their children. I guess you can try to talk it out and 'compromise' with your parents. Tell them about how you've been giving in, and how they should be giving in to some things too, since you aren't overly rebellious to be committing crimes like murdering someone or doing drugs or joining a gang. How other kids are living their lives well or even better, even without parents who keep them in a cage. You just want to live your life like how they did themselves. (Also, earning your own money would be a good idea to have them let you go a little). Be calm and don't scream or shout. Raise your voice a little, just to show how firm you are, but not intimidating.  (I also tried to make them report their whereabouts every few hours to me because I can get 'worried' too and they got sick of it.)  Of course, I know some parents aren't negotiable. At least you tried. That's the time where you can start planning and find a way to be independent. Being financially independent is important here.  but all in all, I'm still stuck in my cage, it just expanded after every negotiation... :') Sorry for the long post. You resonate so much with me that it feels like we could even be friends. Hope this helps! Feel free to contact me if you think I could be of help!",14.055407249841204

2020,nanyang technological university|ntu|computer|com|infosys|information systems|analytics|smart city,Singapore polytechnic|singapore poly|sp,"   Singapore is now in the final stages of sealing a deal for its first  next-generation stealth fighter jets, joining 12 other countries who are  set to receive or currently operate the F-35 Joint Strike Fighters.  Singapore will buy four F-35Bs and evaluate them fully before  committing to a further eight, said Defence Minister Ng Eng Hen last  Monday. The first planes will be based in the United States for training  and evaluation, with delivery expected in 2026.  The US government in January gave the green light for the sale of up  to a dozen elite stealth fighter jets and related equipment to Singapore  for US$2.75 billion (S$3.79 billion). Dr Ng told Parliament last week  that the US Congress has approved the sale as well.  The Straits Times answers some remaining questions about Singapore's F-35 acquisition.  #### Q Why does delivery take six years?  **A** Other than having to clear the backlog of orders  from other countries, defence journalist Mike Yeo said Singapore could  itself have requested the 2026 delivery date to meet its own schedules  for introducing the F-35 into the Republic of Singapore Air Force  (RSAF). ""Another reason could be the potential for further reduction in  acquisition and operating costs at that time, given the F-35 will be  firmly established by then,"" he added.  In the past, it has taken other foreign countries about five years between finalising the deal and delivery of the planes.  For instance, Belgium officially selected 34 F-35As in 2018, with the first deliveries expected in 2023.  Japan announced its decision to buy 42 F-35s in 2011 and received its first planes in 2016.  #### Q Where will the first F-35s be based?  **A** Mr Yeo, who writes for Defense News website,  believes there are three air force bases in the US that are likely  candidates: Marine Corps Air Station (MCAS) Yuma in Arizona, MCAS  Miramar in California and MCAS Beaufort in South Carolina.  The Luke Air Force Base in Arizona, where international F-35 training  is conducted and where the RSAF's Peace Carvin II F-16 detachment is  based, operates the F-35A model, noted Mr Yeo, and thus might not be  useful to the RSAF's F-35Bs.  ""The most obvious reason for basing in the US for training and  evaluation is of course the availability of training airspace and less  restrictions on it.  ""The second reason is basing in the US allows the RSAF to leverage on  the US military's experience and infrastructure in operating the  (F-35B) which would allow the RSAF to adopt the established best  practices for training and operating the F-35B and its unique  capabilities,"" he added.  The US Marine Corps is the only US armed service to also operate the  F-35B, which can take off from a shorter runway and land vertically.  #### Q Why did Singapore place a small initial order for four F-35s, with an option for eight more?  **A** Mr Ben Ho, an airpower analyst with the S.  Rajaratnam School of International Studies, said this reflected  Singapore's gradualist and evolutionary approach towards defence  acquisition.  ""The Republic's modus operandi in this regard has usually been this:  make a limited purchase, slowly ease in the capability while  fastidiously assess its effectiveness and level of integration. Only  when the F-35B has been truly bedded into the RSAF/SAF edifice would  another purchase be considered.""  He noted that while Singapore's first purchase of its F-15s in 2005  was larger with 12 aircraft and an option for eight more, that plane had  ""an enviable decades-long operational record by then"".  ""The same cannot be said of the F-35 at this stage, given that it was  first deployed for operations - with the US military - only in recent  years. This lack of a track record may be key in explaining Singapore's  cautious F-35 buy,"" he added.  Dr Ng had also suggested, in response to a question by Workers' Party  chairman and Aljunied GRC MP Sylvia Lim last Monday, that further  evaluation was important before Singapore commits to a full fleet.  The minister said Singapore was ""in no hurry"" to buy the F-35s, as  the F-15SGs and F-16s are adequate for its air defence and capabilities.  ""We (will) evaluate them fully, including all the questions that were  attributed to the F-35s including costs and maintenance, before we  decide fully on a full fleet of F-35s.""  #### Q Would Singapore still buy the ""A"" variant?  **A** While some have pointed out that the F-35B variant  is more pricey and has lower range and payload compared to the ""A""  model, analysts have said the F-35B's short takeoff and landing  capabilities could allow them to take off from temporary highway strips  should the RSAF's fixed-wing facilities be taken out.  Mr Ho of RSIS said it would make sense to consider the ""A"" model,  which is cheaper and technically less complex. For instance, it can  carry a larger payload and also strike targets from further away than  the ""B"" variant.  ""It is therefore conceivable that the F-35A could be in RSAF service  one day - and this would arguably be well into the 2030s and beyond. By  then, the cost of the F-35 should have gone down significantly and its  problems rectified.""",13.9604393458105

To answer your questions:  1. You will need to remove it as a measure of confidence. Most paramedics wear [short sleeved vests](https://nyp.jobscentral.com.sg/magazine/polytechnic-2017/img/scdf-masthead.jpg) so your tattoo will be visible.  2. Shift cycles go by this: 2 13-hour daytime shifts, 1 day of ""reserved duty"" (administrative work), 1 day off, 2 11-hour night shifts, another day of ""reserved duty"", and 1 day off. By mandate, any work that requires a total of 24 hours of employed work needs to be offset by 48 hours of rest, but because paramedics in SCDF work in staggered 24-hour shifts, there's some flexibility involved.  3. Could you elaborate on what specifics you want to pursue? Urban search and rescue? Mass casualty response? Emergency psychology? These fields are available once you have informed your officer-in-charge of your desired expertise. Usually after you have stabilised for a period of tiem, you can approach your officer-in-charge to plan your career.  4. This will be long, and my memory was taken from my discussions with fellow paramedics that I talked to in my time as a medic, so your mileage may vary.  To start, you will be attached to SAF Medical School seconded under the SCDF organization to train you up on emergency field paramedicine. The total time will be three years, with each year you're being tested on practical and theory work. You will be attached at least six months to a fire station (not sure if by choice or by allocation of manpower resources) to pick up the training on handling real-life patients. You will be mostly performing more advanced duties like needle injection and infusion (IV), airway tubing, vacuum suctioning, ECG and pre-hospital ACLS routines, advanced spine management, extreme traumatic injuries, inter- and post-natal emergencies, and first aid that an NSF medic isn't expected to handle. You will also be learning on field management (e.g. radio reporting, situational awareness etc.) to complement your paramedicine duties. Afterwards, you will be tested, and you need to pass 80% of your assessments to advance to the next level of paramedicine. Only after the completion of 3 years of training will you be officially a paramedic.  Afterwards, you are attached to a fire station, still, not sure if by choice or by current allocation. You have two overall in charge: the commanding officer for the fire station, and the paramedic officer-in-charge of EMS. You will follow the regulations as set by the fire station CO, (as an overall leader in charge of the fire station representing SCDF at large), and you will follow the occupation regulations as set forth by the OIC (operational procedures, case paperwork, medical logistics etc.). Depending on your level of experience, you can be seconded as an assistant to the OIC, or you can be posted as a fast-response paramedic (usually it's performed by paramedics converted from fire and rescue units).  Most firefighters are OK with paramedics, but because the operational framework is different (one deals with fires and rescue operations, the other, fixing the human body so that it survives the hsopital trip) the only other time you get together is in drills and exercises, as well as station bonding activities and various inter-department and inter-division activities. If firefighters are physically shiong, you, as a paramedic, it's a mental shiong.  Rewards may/may not include: letter of commendation by members of the public, appearing in newspapers, service awards. Not so nice things include: public complaints, which may affect your performance bonus.  Last but not least, at the very least, you are serving for a noble cause. May you live long and prosper, and may the odds be ever in your favour. Good luck.",13.841813751613035
2020,nanyang technological university|ntu|computer|com|infosys|information systems|analytics|smart city,ngee ann polytechnic|ngee ann poly|np,"Writer is clearly justifying the case to bail out the national carrier, but really, your former PM Lee Kuan Yew mentioned that Singapore is different, in that the system will not bailout private companies and let them fail if need to be. Of course, me citing his words doesn't mean one has to follow traditions and past ideas blindly. One has to adaptive. Then again, providing a bailout just because of national pride is senseless because when it comes to business, decisions must be firmly rooted in logic and business sense. So what it has won a lot of awards? Also, given the current unpredictability of the business landscape, this company can become an absolute blackhole, sucking endless resources until it finally dies. A national carrier is like a person's car. If the economic situation is bad, lets say an individual is struggling to keep up with mortgages and other fixed payments and unable to maintain steady cash flow, would you quickly dispose the car or change to a smaller car or take public transport? One day when situation is better, maybe i can get myself the same car or better one? Or you would maintain the same car and try to refinance to lower interest rate? It all depends on your current savings and cashflow, plus future business outlook. Anyway, there's so many other corporate options other than bailing out by infusing tax payers' money. Ask the bankers and financiers to refinance, increase existing loan tenures, take on more debts, spin offs, restructure, etc. If really the national pride of Singapore, why not consider a SIA National Pride Bond and raise one round of cash from Singaporeans?   But that's a very simplistic way of thinking but essentially an important one. If Singaporeans refused to bail the national carrier, there are certainly cascading effects at many levels for example, maintenance industry, spare parts suppliers, pull-outs of foreign air industry related companies and so on. Many more and hopefully you are able to mind-map all possibilities. Finally, whether or not SIA deserves a helping hand should be a business decision based on financials and business sense, not an emotional one. SIA should explore and exhaust all possibilities by themselves first before asking for a government bailout. I look forward to reading the future case study of SIA from Harvard.  On a personal note, I have a different perspective when it comes to choosing airlines. I don't take it because the air stewards and stewardesses are handsome, pretty and professional. Also, not because it is more comfortable. These are just bonuses for me. Rather I look at the company's maintenance standards and their procurement practice. Do they procure the best or better planes or entry level planes? Additionally, I look at the country's diplomacy because even though you could be flying through a safe zone, the nationality of the aircraft company,  plays a BIG part in a safe journey. Just for example, flying on an Israelite civilian airplane over a Hezbollah infested area. It's an extreme case but cited to bring the message across. To me, Singapore is an extremely neutral country therefore I always feel safer in a Singaporean aircraft hence the willingness to pay premium when flying long journeys. I don't really associate this advantage to SIA, rather more to the Singapore brand and its diplomacy efforts.",13.362306080383403

Singapore owes a lot of its success to the good foundations built by the British, but of course the media and history books try to claim Singapore was built by the PAP.  Not necessarily true. The notion that the British were 'benevolent' rulers was also a PAP construct. While Singapore didn't have the kind of exploitative rule that other ex-colonial nations had, the 'good foundations' laid were mostly because of Singapore's strategic and trade importance, that served British interests. Social welfare of the local people was just incidental, and was essentially built around 'what do we need to do, to keep this port running'. Colonial prejudice existed, and locals were disallowed from sections of the island, and holding positions of influence within their own society because the British deemed it so.  In fact, the post-WW2 period saw a surge in anti-colonialism, and LKY was a staunch anti-colonialist, determined to show the British the door. [In one of his radio speeches in 1961](https://www.nas.gov.sg/archivesonline/audiovisual_records/record-details/508e51ca-1164-11e3-83d5-0050568939ad), he said this: ""My colleagues and I are of that generation of young men who went through the Second World War and the Japanese Occupation and emerged determined that no one – neither the Japanese nor the British – had the right to push and kick us around.""  What changed? Well, 1965 happened. After Malaysia unceremoniously kicked Singapore out, Singapore relied on British forces until it could stand on its own feet (the British forces withdrew only by 1971). He took great pains to highlight that Singapore had it so much better than the other ex-colonies, where either the withdrawing colonial powers burned things to the ground on their way out, or the newly-formed post-colonial nations eschewed anything related to colonialism. This was in large part a political move to keep the British military in (and British aid that came with it). He had to negotiate with the British government [who were determined to withdraw from the region.](https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_1001_2009-02-10.html)  The ""British rule was good to Singapore"" narrative comes from this. He also chose not to burn bridges, owing to personal connections.  The Bicentennial events did a much better job of covering the complexities of British rule, beyond ""British rule = good"".  Most of Singapore's modern progress can directly be attributed to the leaders who self-governed Singapore from 1955, starting with David Marshall. I sincerely believe the British contribution wasn't as much.  Edit: I forgot to add - one of the reasons why Stamford Raffles is regarded as the 'founder' of Singapore - and by extension a benevolent ruler, is also in part political. Post-1965, the leaders of Singapore were concerned that the multicultural population would fall back to their cultural defaults... like, the Chinese would go back to China, the Indians would go back to India, and the Malays would owe their allegiance to the newly-formed Malaysia. S. Rajarathnam says this in his memoirs, that they had to choose a 'neutral' icon to build a new national identity around, that wouldn't polarise the different communities of Singapore along race or religion. HENCE Raffles was chosen.  There's some crazy stuff in Singaporean history, man.",11.847818560284873

Don't think many malaysians hold very technical and highly-skilled positions in singapore that are critical to our survivability in this virus situation.  And actually it's not like we've got no people, because we do have significant manpower which can be tapped upon in an emergency - like our NSFs. And also those who don't quite have jobs to do at the moment due to the crisis, like air-stewards/stewardesses and other hospitality workers and restaurant chefs etc, they too can be utilised to fill in necessary gaps.  What's important in crises such as this, are water, food and medical supplies/resources/workers.   I guess we are almost water-secured (after decades of work in this area), but food is still a big big issue. Other than investing in food research and industry in the long run, we also need to think about how we can ramp up our own food resources in emergency situations. Some crazy ideas would be like a fast conversion of Tekong into farmland and get our nsf boys to become farmers (some sort like an old chinese system of farmers in peace time and soldiers in war time). Or get the RCs to activate those people who can grow vegetables and other foodstuff to work at plots in our HDB estates. Round up those cocks and hens roaming around country and get them to work - mulitply and lay eggs!  We also need to shift more of our food and medical industries back onto our land. Like how our ST is shifting their mask-making machineries from Taiwan back to singapore. Also bring more of our fish farms into our waters? Maybe have a few more egg farms on our land? As limited as our land is, we need to think how we can maximise it for food and medical supplies, for both long-term and emergencies. High-rise farming? Level one for goats, level two for chickens, ..., penthouse for vegetables?

There’s a lot of problems in this world, and many can be tied to a few root causes: money, social status, and power. The desire for more money creates rampant wealth and resource inequality, as it is a dog-eat-dog situation and those who have a better start will get even more well off. Social status creates wastage, mindless consumerism, and a desire to fit in to a “norm” just so you don’t get negatively judged. Power creates conflict and disrespect for lives and others, like dictators, coups, and wars.  Yet people are drawn to these things. Why would scientists’ expert opinion/common sense be discarded in favour of idiots (e.g. Trump) and celebrities/influencers? Why are celebrities who oftentimes were no bastion of morality being regarded as standards for morality? Why do Trump never ever admit his fault and always inflate his ego (lying about his knowlege, about how people “look up” to him, that he is filthy rich)? Why the poor who suffers most in Brexit supports Brexit? Why mid tier bureaucrats in China had to suppress news of the coronavirus for their own political expediency, which ended up sabotaging the world?  In the past, those things brought us far. But the future doesn’t need them to be so unrestrained anymore. We need to keep them in check.

Humanity is not able to live in harmony with nature. We only know how to exploit and rape God's creation/nature. Nobody is innocent. We live in a fake, made up fairytale world of our own making in Instagram and Facebook while the real world is being destroyed under the weight of our collective excess and self centeredness. Humanity's problems are not external to us. Climate change is not a problem imposed to us by something else. It is a problem that stems from the selfishness and utter depravity endemic to every human heart.   Based on my understanding, we are currently going through a sixth mass extinction event called the Holocene extinction ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holocene\_extinction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holocene_extinction)). Ecological collapse is under way from the highest level to the lowest most crucial level involving pollinators such as bees, butterflies etc etc ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decline\_in\_insect\_populations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decline_in_insect_populations),  [https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/27/magazine/insect-apocalypse.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/27/magazine/insect-apocalypse.html) ). This alone could collapse the world's farm belt.  I understand now we are seeing record locust swarms ravaging Africa, China and India ([https://www.bbc.com/news/in-pictures-51618188](https://www.bbc.com/news/in-pictures-51618188)). There is also a giant island made of our non biodegradable rubbish called the Great Pacific Garbage Patch that is 3 times the size of France floating in the middle of the ocean. But it's not just in the ocean. It's in our bodies too. You can actually detect a certain level of BPA in the vast majority of people in the developed world today. We have not only poisoned mother nature with our waste but we have poisoned ourselves too. Nobody knows the long term effects of these compounds on the human body. But because it's cheap and convenient, nobody gives a fuck.  Warming ocean also means that the marine ecology will collapse and we will have a dead, warm and acidic ocean.  We should also talk about factory farming. Only a fraction of the nutrients from fodder crops (corn, wheat etc etc.) end up in the meat we buy in the end. Cows, for example, convert only about 4% of the proteins, and 3% of the calories of the plants we feed to them into beef. More than 97% of the calories are lost to us. To create one kilogram of steak, a cow needs to eat up to 25 kilos of grain and uses up to 15,000 liters of water. Animal products are guzzling up tons of food but they only make up 18% of the calories humans eat. It is an inefficient way to raise food and acquire calories.  According to projections, we could nourish an additional 3.5 billion people if we just ate the stuff we feed to animals.  Additionally, about 15% of all greenhouse gas emissions caused by humans, are created by the meat industry; as much as by all ships, planes, trucks and cars combined.  Lastly, animal cruelty in factory farms. Factory farms are engineered to be as efficient as possible, they have little regard for things like quality of life. Most pigs are raised in gigantic windowless sheds, and never get to see the sun. Sows are kept in pens too small to turn around, where they give birth to one litter of piglets after another, until it's their turn to be turned into bacon. Dairy cows are continually raped using a semen injecting prod to forcibly impregnate them to ensure their milk supply, but are separated from their calves hours after birth. To fatten up beef cattle for slaughter, they're put in feedlots: Confined pens where they can't roam and put on weight more quickly.  the ones that may have got the worst deal are chickens. In factory farms, they're kept in such vast numbers, and so close to each other, that they can't form the social structures they have in nature, so they start attacking each other. To stop that we cut their beaks and claws. Male chickens are deemed worthless, since they can't lay eggs and are not suitable for meat production. So within minutes after birth, they're usually gassed and shredded in grinders.  The center cannot hold. We are going to be destroyed and we deserve it.",15.859559755259232

Whenever I did something wrong, like not reporting my whereabouts often enough, or just anything that they didn't like, my mom would give me the silent treatment for weeks. That severely lowered my self-esteem. I felt left out, worthless, and unwanted as a child. I have 0 self-esteem. I wanted to take my own life as a child (now I just laugh at how childish it is).  There are more. Basically, they are overly worried about me. But are slowly learning to let things go. This was how I did it.  I told them how if I had to tell them about my whereabouts every time, I'd rather stay home. If they aren't letting me do any work on my own, I'd rather try nothing at all. If they aren't letting me go overseas, fine. I'll be a country bumpkin for the rest of my life. That was how rebellious I am. I get laughed at, but most people are going to criticize their parenting style. I spelled it out to them clearly. If they keep worrying, then I'd rather DO NOTHING and stay in their sight, be a bum until I annoy them (of course it didn't happen). I told them everything calmly. And I said I hated silent treatment because of how manipulative and abusive it is. My mom gave me the silent treatment less frequently as a result, and they started letting things go slowly. I started to be able to breathe then.  But now, getting into a [r/s](https://www.reddit.com/r/s/) is sure a whole new challenge. I was given the silent treatment 4 times in a row within 2 months just because I got a little too intimate with my partner (nothing more than hugging), and I went to another room to talk to my partner over the phone (so she doesn't hear me speak loveydovey). She began mentioning how I'd pick my new partner over her and how I'd throw her away in a heartbeat (which is stupid).  The list goes on. She told me not to go to weddings (I was invited), because they'd make me drunk(?) She said I can't go to my partner's place/can't be alone with him in a private space. Lately, she gave me another silent treatment for hugging my partner. I know, ridiculous. She also began suspecting if I actually gave away my virginity (not true). Ridiculous, yes. So I told her, I don't think I did anything wrong. I can end my [r/s](https://www.reddit.com/r/s/) right now if she thinks it's appropriate. I won't bother finding another for the rest of my life if she just wants me all to herself. I ended it calmly with, if she can't trust me at all, I'll just follow her wherever she goes. And by everywhere, I really mean it. A bird stuck in a cage dies after the owner loses his/her life.  This is still an ongoing thing. It's another obstacle to go through. I'm not encouraging you to be rebellious like me. But talk it out, let your parents know what they are doing to you and how others would think when they see this. I think parents are always learning to be parents, and this can be taught by their children. I guess you can try to talk it out and 'compromise' with your parents. Tell them about how you've been giving in, and how they should be giving in to some things too, since you aren't overly rebellious to be committing crimes like murdering someone or doing drugs or joining a gang. How other kids are living their lives well or even better, even without parents who keep them in a cage. You just want to live your life like how they did themselves. (Also, earning your own money would be a good idea to have them let you go a little). Be calm and don't scream or shout. Raise your voice a little, just to show how firm you are, but not intimidating.  (I also tried to make them report their whereabouts every few hours to me because I can get 'worried' too and they got sick of it.)  Of course, I know some parents aren't negotiable. At least you tried. That's the time where you can start planning and find a way to be independent. Being financially independent is important here.  but all in all, I'm still stuck in my cage, it just expanded after every negotiation... :') Sorry for the long post. You resonate so much with me that it feels like we could even be friends. Hope this helps! Feel free to contact me if you think I could be of help!",13.963272522358551

To answer your questions:  1. You will need to remove it as a measure of confidence. Most paramedics wear [short sleeved vests](https://nyp.jobscentral.com.sg/magazine/polytechnic-2017/img/scdf-masthead.jpg) so your tattoo will be visible.  2. Shift cycles go by this: 2 13-hour daytime shifts, 1 day of ""reserved duty"" (administrative work), 1 day off, 2 11-hour night shifts, another day of ""reserved duty"", and 1 day off. By mandate, any work that requires a total of 24 hours of employed work needs to be offset by 48 hours of rest, but because paramedics in SCDF work in staggered 24-hour shifts, there's some flexibility involved.  3. Could you elaborate on what specifics you want to pursue? Urban search and rescue? Mass casualty response? Emergency psychology? These fields are available once you have informed your officer-in-charge of your desired expertise. Usually after you have stabilised for a period of tiem, you can approach your officer-in-charge to plan your career.  4. This will be long, and my memory was taken from my discussions with fellow paramedics that I talked to in my time as a medic, so your mileage may vary.  To start, you will be attached to SAF Medical School seconded under the SCDF organization to train you up on emergency field paramedicine. The total time will be three years, with each year you're being tested on practical and theory work. You will be attached at least six months to a fire station (not sure if by choice or by allocation of manpower resources) to pick up the training on handling real-life patients. You will be mostly performing more advanced duties like needle injection and infusion (IV), airway tubing, vacuum suctioning, ECG and pre-hospital ACLS routines, advanced spine management, extreme traumatic injuries, inter- and post-natal emergencies, and first aid that an NSF medic isn't expected to handle. You will also be learning on field management (e.g. radio reporting, situational awareness etc.) to complement your paramedicine duties. Afterwards, you will be tested, and you need to pass 80% of your assessments to advance to the next level of paramedicine. Only after the completion of 3 years of training will you be officially a paramedic.  Afterwards, you are attached to a fire station, still, not sure if by choice or by current allocation. You have two overall in charge: the commanding officer for the fire station, and the paramedic officer-in-charge of EMS. You will follow the regulations as set by the fire station CO, (as an overall leader in charge of the fire station representing SCDF at large), and you will follow the occupation regulations as set forth by the OIC (operational procedures, case paperwork, medical logistics etc.). Depending on your level of experience, you can be seconded as an assistant to the OIC, or you can be posted as a fast-response paramedic (usually it's performed by paramedics converted from fire and rescue units).  Most firefighters are OK with paramedics, but because the operational framework is different (one deals with fires and rescue operations, the other, fixing the human body so that it survives the hsopital trip) the only other time you get together is in drills and exercises, as well as station bonding activities and various inter-department and inter-division activities. If firefighters are physically shiong, you, as a paramedic, it's a mental shiong.  Rewards may/may not include: letter of commendation by members of the public, appearing in newspapers, service awards. Not so nice things include: public complaints, which may affect your performance bonus.  Last but not least, at the very least, you are serving for a noble cause. May you live long and prosper, and may the odds be ever in your favour. Good luck.",13.666668896149785

Now this is one of the kinds of analysis that when interpreting the visualisation you must have in mind a few caveats. Although it is generally advised not to pick a course solely on remuneration, undoubtedly some are willing to sacrifice their happiness working in a field they later find they dislike for a higher pay, and this is their decision.   That being said, this plot is still interesting enough although with a few important things to note:  \- 10% IGP is not the minimum and may be a good measure, but A lvl Rank points does not solely determine the difficulty of entrance for some courses. Especially for courses with interviews, it is quite often the case where the real difficulty lies in passing the interview and not the RP filtering stage  \- For 85 RP courses, it is obvious that quite a few could, and will be greater than 85 RP. This is just a result of the published IGPs holding GP to be a 'C' grade, a decision made by the universities/MOE.  \- This does not take into account non-normal admission like discretionary admission scheme  \- <Honour> variants of the majors were assumed to have the same IGP. If this does not seem to make sense do point out!  \- Horizontal and Vertical lines are the major-wise mean of the courses analysed here. If your major is not here, it must have meant I could not obtain the data for either dimension.  \- One last thing to add is that starting salary is not necessarily the best measure for some majors. For one example, accountancy is known to have lower starting pay but more well-known for its increment/progression. So do take note of this.  \- Business Analytics is from Computing but it is a Bachelor of Science  \- the usual problems for GES in general still apply, like reporting bias, sample size etc. (although all here are >30, but that's still not significantly big).  \- Decided to do for gross starting remuneration but basic could also hold some insights.  \- For obvious reasons, there is a 3/4 year lag between the latest batch(IGP) and the batch whose GES was considered.  &#x200B;  Data was taken from MOE at: [https://www.moe.gov.sg/docs/default-source/document/education/post-secondary/files/web-publication-nus-ges-2019.pdf](https://www.moe.gov.sg/docs/default-source/document/education/post-secondary/files/web-publication-nus-ges-2019.pdf)  Some footnotes copy and pasted from their report:  ""  6.

2020,nanyang technological university|ntu|computer|com|infosys|information systems|analytics|smart city,temasek polytechnic|temasek poly|tp,"Read the immediate parent thread above - this discussion pertains to what the USA and its leaders have been doing.  If you don't like that, make your comments in another thread.  Since you would rather read the Jakarta Post (lol - the same Jakarta Post that accused Singapore of not sharing information on cases) than the WHO reports I referred you to, here is a link to spoonfeed you: https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/who-china-joint-mission-on-covid-19-final-report.pdf  It takes time and diplomacy to assemble and approve an official WHO team to visit an outbreak epicenter for an official report (such as the one I linked).  Members of the epidemic-specific investigative team from WHO were carefully selected and vetted, based on their individual experience, countries of expertise, and type of skills they would bring to the team. After the selection process, they then had to be additionally vetted and approved by their home countries as well as China, and cleared to visit high-risk areas (i.e. places where the virus was rampant) that were technically already on strict governmental lockdown.  Note also that the WHO already had regular WHO staff in China (i.e. in the WHO China branches, in main Chinese cities) from the beginning.  There was never any point in time in which there was zero WHO presence in China during this outbreak.    The international team that carried out the Feb 16-24 investigation was comprised of experts from all over the world (including a Singapore  expert).  Taiwan has had access to WHO data one way or another, even though it is not ""formally acknowledged"" as a country.  This is how things work diplomatically and internationally - just because a country is not a WHO member does not mean it will not receive the data through unofficial, unacknowledged means.  Note also that travel bans are a two-way process in that if one country is on lockdown, the flow of travelers is automatically reduced regardless of whether the other country implements bans.  For example, Malaysia is now on lockdown - and so a Singapore travel ban against Malaysia would not currently make a sizeable difference to the influx of Malaysians to Singapore.  That said, China has banned solo travel to Taiwan since mid-2019 (you can easily check this through multiple news sources).  In effect, any bans coming from Taiwan in 2020 have had a negligible influence on pre-existing travel flow.  >*""virus can come from anywhere, even SG has wet markets. as to their TCM wildlife trade, it has to stop and i think they're really gonna clamp down hard this time, or else we'll get another round. We should be sharing data with TW/HK/SK those who successfully play defence, as well as look at the italian data and make sure we have mitigation steps if it gets to that stage.""*  I have no idea why you went off on an unrelated tangent regarding TCM wildlife trade and sharing data, as these points are unrelated to the original discussion.  Data-sharing between countries is a given, and has taken place since January - every country has sent data through international channels (the WHO has a formal process for collating data from all countries and making sure it is shared).  Singapore has followed all WHO-recommended international procedures for data-sharing, and was even commended by the WHO as a country that has been quick and prompt to fill and submit the WHO forms/reports to facilitate this sharing. In a pandemic, data-sharing is centralized by the WHO, and is not on the informal level (i.e. not subject to country-to-country agreements) you imply it is.  I strongly suggest reading up on international crisis response procedures and protocols, especially WHO-affiliated reports and those authored by experts with a background in public health and epidemiology.  Pandemic management involves both public health expertise as well as diplomacy management - there are standard ways in which this plays out during an epidemic/pandemic.  If you are really interested in learning more about pandemic crisis management, I suggest you look to (for starters) WHO publications as well as peer-reviewed publications in well-established academic journals.",13.458103553862188
2020,nanyang technological university|ntu|computer|com|infosys|information systems|analytics|smart city,temasek polytechnic|temasek poly|tp,"> And so I believe there is no longer any need to debate this point.  My original comment is not a truth claim about heaven, but one about life on Earth - sorrow and sadness and depth lends depth to our current existence, and these things would not be present in Heaven (I think you won't disagree here since you define Heave as without sorrow, heaven, or death).   > Firstly, I did not state that ""God works in ways we cannot comprehend"". I have always held that God is his actions are always explained through analyzing scripture. Sometimes this is given explicitly (in the case of Job)… Therefore it is more accurate to say ""God always reveals the reasons behind his actions, even if it may not be initially understood"".  Actually I don't think this is an accurate summary of your earlier position. You have previously stated that ""*I am merely pointing out how a being of infinite intelligence might do something that we are incapable of understanding, but we are provided with sufficient scriptural evidence that God has our best interests at heart.*"", which I took to understand that God may do things that we have no means of understanding, however the Bible says that he has our interests at heart. Clearly, having our interests at heart, and understanding God's actions are different issues, since we can believe that he has out interests at heart without fully understanding what he is doing.   > Nope, that does not add up logically in the story of Genesis. Why would God create the tree of the knowledge of good and evil then? If he explained to A&E what is good and evil then there was no need to create the tree. It is completely unreasonable.  No, I'm not saying that he needs to fully explain to them good and evil, because then they would not even need the tree. I am expanding though on your reasoning that we can fill in reasonable gaps in the bible. So if God says ""do not do X or Y will happen"", if he has to give some explanation on what Y is, ""death is what happens when you stop living and you will come back to heaven"" (you can see the logical problems of explaining death in a pre-fall world where no one has died, and so the system of good souls going to heaven has not even been established), then he logically would give some explanation on what X is as well ""do not eat the fruit of the tree because it contains knowledge that is forbidden to you that only I as God can know and you cannot know"".   > So, what is your stance on this matter? If you had the power to decide, would you: A) take the life of a child and bring it into heavenly paradise where there is no suffering OR B) allow the child to live, brought up in a violent environment, surrounded by evil people with evil corrupted hearts, likely to be raped and tortured (these are not unfounded scenarios. We have seen the actions of the Sodomites, whom God deemed too evil and needed to be destoryed. When they found out there were visitors in the city, they set out to rape them. Genesis 19:1-4)  Well this is a false dichotomy for an omnipotent being right? If I had God's power to decide, my options surely are not A or B. Plus I want to clarify here - if the children (referring to new born) are so corrupt that they cannot be redeemed and have to be killed, how do they go to heaven? I know the traditional view that all children are innocent and hence to go to heaven by default, but then you are also saying that these children are inherently tainted.   > And since both are equally probable, I know you will pick ""nature"" as the explanation and say innocent babies who could not have adotped evil practices were killed, but I think at this point in time it is fair to say that science that applies to us as human beings, past, present, and future, holds true in that ""corrupted"" genes can indeed be passed down. While you will say this is adding to the scripture, I'd argue that it is fair to add in something that has been scientifically proven to be an innate trait of human beings that affects us now just as it affected us then.  Yes but the science you are citing does not say that ""nature""/genes are the exclusive manner in which psychopathy is passed down. Both nature and nurture are influences. And the science is just on psychopathy and not ""evil practices"" generally.  If we accept that nurture plays an equal part and/or is equally probable, then the basis for killing babies is no longer strong, since you can obviously remove the baby from the evil environment and it will have a chance to grow up normally. So I think that your position is still problematic, since you are specifically relying on this ""nature"" argument to kill newborn babies.   > Logic comes from God, so it would make sense that He would not be subject to something that came from Him.  Then I don't follow why you think God cannot do illogical things. If logic comes from him, then what he does will automatically become logical. On this particular point I logically actually don't see the problem in just saying that God can square a circle. I would even apply your own arguments about us not being able to fully understand how God works. Just as an ant does not fully grasp the concept of three dimensions, God could exist in dimensions beyond our three and so he would be entirely able to square a circle, just like how we can cube a square.   > I'm not sure what you are trying to prove here.  The point I'm making is actually just in ""Adam has become like one of us"". Because if God is a source of knowledge, then saying that Adam has become like God, suggests that Adam is now a source of knowledge. If the point was simply that Adam possesses knowledge, then God would have just said ""Adam now has knowledge of Good and Evil"", rather than making the specific comparison to himself.   > In the case of using the Isrealites to exact divine judgement via war, a flood would kill the Isrealites as well.  Well then clearly he can save the Israelite tribes just as he saved Noah's family.   > Another reason is to demonstrate that God always keeps His promises. He promised to never flood the Earth again. Genesis 9:11.  His specific promise was ""I establish my covenant with you: Never again will all life be destroyed by the waters of a flood; never again will there be a flood to destroy the earth.”. Again as an omnipotent being there are plenty of other ways of wiping out life on earth - volcanoes, covid viruses, and so on. The flood is merely just one way that he has promised not to use again.   So this brings us back to the question of why, despite there being many other options that does not require God to rely or use the evil of men to carry out his judgment, he chose to declare war.",13.417812958806008
2020,nanyang technological university|ntu|computer|com|infosys|information systems|analytics|smart city,temasek polytechnic|temasek poly|tp,"   A little-known enclave of black-and-white heritage homes near the  base of Mount Faber that are typically occupied by expatriates and  well-heeled Singaporeans could soon be opened up for a heritage trail.  This follows a recent $1 million refurbishment of five bungalows there, funded by the Singapore Land Authority (SLA).  Constructed between 1908 and 1919, the Pender Road homes were part of  the first wave of colonial black-and-white bungalows to be built in  Singapore.  Heritage experts, including blogger Jerome Lim, are excited that the  gated complex is being opened up to Singaporeans. Mr Lim said such tours  help give Singaporeans a better grasp of the various heritage  structures dotting the island.  In this case, tours will provide a better understanding of the evolution of the landed colonial-era homes here, he said.  SLA - which manages around 1,700 residential state properties across  Singapore, of which 500 are colonial black-and-white bungalows - has  organised heritage tours for other state properties under its watch,  including the[ former Pasir Panjang Power Station](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/pasir-panjang-power-district-up-for-development-next-year-ideas-from-public-on-exhibition) and Changi Hospital.  Last month, it gave The Straits Times an exclusive look at the  refreshed Pender Road spaces which can be rented out for two-or  three-year periods at prevailing market rates.  The  houses' damaged and leaking roofs have been retiled and waterproofed,  while the lightning protection systems, electrical wiring and the site's  sewage infrastructure have all been upgraded. The bungalows' original  timber floors were also repaired and varnished.  These bungalows, which lie in the Southern Ridges conservation area,  were identified by SLA for maintenance and repair works late last year.  An SLA spokesman said such works are usually scheduled upon expiry of  existing tenancies, following building management inspections.  According to Knight Frank, the site's managing agent, the houses at  1, 2, 3, 4A and 5 Pender Road have a land area of between 1,100 sq m and  4,400 sq m. Rental rates start at $10,000.  Mr Lim highlighted the bungalows' rarity and heritage value. He said  Pender Road's black-and-white bungalows differ from others around the  island, many of which technically should not be described as black and  white.     For instance, timber is used more extensively across the Pender Road  clutch, unlike in the majority of colonial bungalows in Singapore,  including those in places like Sembawang, Alexandra Park, Malcolm Road  and Temenggong Road. Designed by the Public Works Department, the bulk  of these other bungalows were mainly constructed with concrete and  largely built after 1925.  The Pender Road bungalows were built for the Eastern Extension  Telegraph Company by architectural firm Swan & Maclaren. Among its  staff were cable jointers and engineers who lived there until the 1950s.  Its cable depot, workshops and wharves were at Bukit Chermin - close to  Pender Road.  📷   Related Story   #### [Belle of Pender Road](https://www.straitstimes.com/lifestyle/home-design/belle-of-pender-road)  Mr Lim said: ""Companies then took really good care of these workers,  who were considered rather fortunate. It was an era where they hired  architects to build homes for their skilled staff.  ""The company would even attach servants to take care of them and the  spaces they occupied. Servant entrances were built at the back of these  bungalows.""  Another highlight in Pender Road is house No. 4. Its L-shaped design  made it possible for single rooms to be carved out along its long  corridors for the bachelor staff of the Eastern Extension Telegraph  Company.  These staff members were generally from the cable jointing  department. They would have come together after work in the evenings in  the common sitting area of their home with the wooden shutter windows  flung open, noted Mr Lim.

Having no point of reference does not eliminate the possibility of then Heaven having greater depth than life on Earth. I should clarify and rephrase: there is no sufficient scriptural text to give us a clear picture of what Heaven is like. We are given glimpses of it though.  Here are some scriptures of Heaven:  >Rev 21:4 He will wipe away every tear from their eyes, and death shall be no more, neither shall there be mourning, nor crying, nor pain anymore, for the former things have passed away.”  There is no death, no negative emotions in Heaven.  >John 14:2 In my Father's house are many rooms. If it were not so, would I have told you that I go to prepare a place for you?  There is a house, though it could be metaphorical. Since Jesus also spoke of ""the Kingdom of Heaven"" the imagery that conjures is that of a city with many houses and buildings.  >1 Cor 2:9 But, as it is written, “What no eye has seen, nor ear heard, nor the heart of man imagined, what God has prepared for those who love him”—  As I have mentioned, Heaven is a place no one can even conceive of what it is like for no one has even seen, heard or even imagined what it is like. Whatever we are capable of imagining Heaven is like, it is better than that.  There are other scriptures on Heaven but I think these are sufficient for the sake of this discussion and my stance that Heaven is a place that is like a city. It is a kingdom. For that reason I believe it holds more depth than life on Earth. Perhaps there will be jobs and activities for everyone, but whatever it is, we are literally incapable of imagining it. What would it be like to have a new sense? To see a new color?   2) Apart from naming animals they were also tasked with ruling over all the animals. He also told them to be fruitful and multiply. Surely God gave them sufficient thinking skills to accomplish the tasks of ruling over animals and raising children. One would require some form of critical thinking skills to know not to toss an animal that is unable to swim into the water, or throw a fish onto land.   3)  >Judgment can well involve merciless killing.  Yes but that wouldn't be objectively moral judgement. That's not how God has acted. God has always punished those deserving of punishment.  On your example of the flood killing innocent animals, it must be noted that animals do not have souls like humans do. That being said, we must be careful not to impose what we believe to be moral onto the actions of God, who is objectively moral and has authority over all creation. I am inclined to believe that this is merely a transition for the animals from earth into paradise. For the evil people who were rightfully sentenced in the flood, their destination would be very different.   Deuteronomy 24:16 is a precept laid down by which the legal system of Israel would function once they were established in the land. It was not the right of the human courts to exact capital punishment from the children of guilty parents if the children were not personally guilty of the crime. It only applies specifically to the Isrealites at that specific point in time. That which restricts the power of human courts does not restrict the right or authority of God.  Furthermore, psychopathy is a genetic trait that can be passed down through generations that corrupts moral reasoning.   From this article:   https://edition.cnn.com/2015/06/16/health/birth-of-psychopath/index.html  >Psychopathy is also an inherited condition, according to J. Reid Meloy, forensic psychologist and author of ""The Psychopathic Mind."" ""The more severe the psychopathy, the greater the inheritance for the disorder,"" he said.  Therefore, generations of psychopaths will lead to the increased birthrates of psychopaths, and over thousands of years, every newborn would indeed have psychopathy.   4) since this is similar to the above point, im going to leave it out as it is redundant.",12.79543274419995
2020,nanyang technological university|ntu|computer|com|infosys|information systems|analytics|smart city,temasek polytechnic|temasek poly|tp,">The true position is simply that we do not know the scope of heaven and so we do not know whether it lacks depth in comparison to life on Earth.   While I do not agree entirely with you, since you have made a truth claim to this, I'm sure you would be satisfied with your own reply to your initial statement:  >1. Death, sadness, and misery are part of the human experience and it has given our lives depth which would be absent if we continued to live in a Utopian garden paradise. We would not be able to appreciate things like a Greek tragedy, the loss of a friend, disappointment and fear that we overcome, without living in a world with brief lives and sadness.  And so I believe there is no longer any need to debate this point.   >I don't think it is fair to say I have shifted goal posts, because I specifically included a moral decision in the very first time you asked me to define critical thinking - ""Critical thinking has a fairly broad definition, but I consider at its heart would be the ability to evaluate two competing positions both with benefits and flaws, and arriving at a judgment call. Like I said, it would involve being able to answer a question like the one I posed earlier about letting innocent people got to jail. Without knowledge of good and evil do you think Adam can answer such a question?""  Well then it's fair to say we don't agree on the definition of ""critical thinking"". I have stated my definition, and I make it a clear distinction from ""moral reasoning"". It would appear that you would consider ""moral reasoning"" as a quintessential aspect of ""critial thinking"" but I do not. So to answer your 2nd initial point:  >2. I am not sure how it is logically possible to have critical thinking without an understanding of what is good and evil. Critical thinking by definition involves the evaluation of whether something is good or bad. If pre-tree of knowledge humans simply lived in a state of ""Listen to God"" then that is not critical thinking, it would be total subservience to a higher power (which can be a good or bad thing, depending on your perspective).  By my definition of what critical thinking is, a state of ""Listen to God"" does not involve total subservience, and actually the very act of A&E's choice to disobey disproves your very claim that they are in total subservience. The story tells us that they disobeyed, which means they were not totally subservience. In any case… I'd argue that ""the evaluation of wheather something is good or bad"" is actually the definition of ""moral reasoning"" and not ""critical thinking""… but you're free to have your own worldview. I think that reasonably clears up this point as well.  >But by the same view that you state else where that God is infinitely intelligent and works in ways that we cannot comprehend, why should God be required to adhere to what we think is ""logical sense"" in setting rules for Adam? If we allow this kind of reasonable inference, then it is also reasonable to expect that God would have given some explanation to Adam on what exactly is ""knowledge of good and evil"".   Firstly, I did not state that ""God works in ways we cannot comprehend"". I have always held that God is his actions are *always* explained through analyzing scripture. Sometimes this is given explicitly (in the case of Job)… Therefore it is more accurate to say ""God always reveals the reasons behind his actions, even if it may not be initially understood"". In this way, we are able to have good faith that God will act in the same ways he has acted before as per recorded in the scripture and these reasons *always* make logical sense and demonstrate rightful judgement.  That being said, to answer your question:  >why should God be required to adhere to what we think is ""logical sense"" in setting rules for Adam?   Because it is logically consistent and scripturally evidential for God to act in a logically coherent manner.  >If we allow this kind of reasonable inference, then it is also reasonable to expect that God would have given some explanation to Adam on what exactly is ""knowledge of good and evil"".   Nope, that does not add up logically in the story of Genesis. Why would God create the tree of the knowledge of good and evil then? If he explained to A&E what is good and evil then there was no need to create the tree. It is completely unreasonable.  Saying ""if you do A then B"" without explaining what is ""B"" is completely unreasonable as well. It should follow, and be logically coherent that B, was explained to A&E. It should also follow, and be logically coherent, that the existence of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, (supported by scripture that revealed that A&E did indeed gain knowledge that they previously did not have prior to eating the fruit), it is reasonable to conclude that God did not explain to them what ""knowledge of good and evil"" is. They acquired that knowledge through eating the fruit.  >Sure it would not be good for a child to be born into this place, but that is a separate issue from whether it is just to kill a newborn child that has been born into such a place. This is where I see you adding reason to the bible.  So, what is your stance on this matter? If you had the power to decide, would you:  A) take the life of a child and bring it into heavenly paradise where there is no suffering  Or  B) allow the child to live, brought up in a violent environment, surrounded by evil people with evil corrupted hearts, likely to be raped and tortured (these are not unfounded scenarios. We have seen the actions of the Sodomites, whom God deemed too evil and needed to be destoryed. When they found out there were visitors in the city, they set out to rape them. Genesis 19:1-4)  >The logical inference fails because the notion of ""pass down the bloodline"" (or genetic transfer of evil) has to compete with an obvious competing and equally likely (if not more) reason that people who are raised in an evil society are more likely to be evil. Nature versus Nurture, if you will. Both explanations are equally likely to explain why Lot's daughters (who grew up in Sodom), or surviving Canaanites tended towards evil, and continued to spread evil practices.   >If there are two competing, equally probably explanations, then we cannot simply just pick one under the guise of calling it a logical inference.   While this is true, as the stories illustrste, it doesn't matter which is passed down, ""nature"" in the form of genetics or ""nurture"" in the form of learned evil practices. What is true is that evil was passed down from the survivors. And since both are equally probable, I know you will pick ""nurture"" as the explanation and say innocent babies who could not have adotped evil practices were killed, but I think at this point in time it is fair to say that science that applies to us as human beings, past, present, and future, holds true in that ""corrupted"" genes can indeed be passed down. While you will say this is adding to the scripture, I'd argue that it is fair to add in something that has been scientifically proven to be an innate trait of human beings that affects us now just as it affected us then. As such I will keep my stance that what is passed down is ""nature"", or corrupted genes.  >Then wouldn't this mean that God is subject to the requirements of logic?   Logic comes from God, so it would make sense that He would not be subject to something that came from Him. Rather, logic is subject to God. What I know is that God has never demonstrated to perform any illogical acts. From the three aspects of God I have listed, and supported by scripture detailing all acts of God to be logical, I can reasonably conclude that God will always act in a logical manner.   >Again, this appears to me that at very least God is limited by the requirements of logic.   Just because God chooses to be logical doesn't mean he is subject to the requirements of logic. Just because I choose to keep my eyes closed doesn't mean I am blind.  >I'm making a point based on the wording of Gensis. Even if we adopt your formulation that God is the source of knowledge, it would not make logical sense (since it seems it is necessary for God to act logically) for God to say that Adam has become like one of us, with knowledge of good and evil. Does the ""like one of us"" denote that Adam too has become a source of knowledge?   I'm not sure what you are trying to prove here. How does, and I quote you, ""Adam has become like one of us, with knowledge of good and evil."" become ""Adam has become like one of us, the source of the knowledge of good and evil."" Or even, going back to your previous statement ""Adam has become like one of us, knowledge"".  You are changing the meaning of the sentences and I'm not sure what you are even trying to point out.  Perhaps you are trying to make a distinction between ""God is the source of knowledge"" and ""God possesses knowledge"". If that is your point then my reply would be that God is both the source of knowledge and he also possesses the knowledge.   >Ah but we have established that God can very well flood everyone through his own power, so why must he work through the evil of men?  Because both are completely different scenarios. In the case of the flood, God only allowed Noah and His family to live. As it was stated, the rest of the entire world was too corrupted. In the case of using the Isrealites to exact divine judgement via war on specific nations, not the entire world. a flood would kill the Isrealites as well as those not deserving of violent death  Another reason is to demonstrate that God always keeps His promises. He promised to never flood the Earth again. Genesis 9:11.",12.444682775310522

To answer your questions:  1. You will need to remove it as a measure of confidence. Most paramedics wear [short sleeved vests](https://nyp.jobscentral.com.sg/magazine/polytechnic-2017/img/scdf-masthead.jpg) so your tattoo will be visible.  2. Shift cycles go by this: 2 13-hour daytime shifts, 1 day of ""reserved duty"" (administrative work), 1 day off, 2 11-hour night shifts, another day of ""reserved duty"", and 1 day off. By mandate, any work that requires a total of 24 hours of employed work needs to be offset by 48 hours of rest, but because paramedics in SCDF work in staggered 24-hour shifts, there's some flexibility involved.  3. Could you elaborate on what specifics you want to pursue? Urban search and rescue? Mass casualty response? Emergency psychology? These fields are available once you have informed your officer-in-charge of your desired expertise. Usually after you have stabilised for a period of tiem, you can approach your officer-in-charge to plan your career.  4. This will be long, and my memory was taken from my discussions with fellow paramedics that I talked to in my time as a medic, so your mileage may vary.  To start, you will be attached to SAF Medical School seconded under the SCDF organization to train you up on emergency field paramedicine. The total time will be three years, with each year you're being tested on practical and theory work. You will be attached at least six months to a fire station (not sure if by choice or by allocation of manpower resources) to pick up the training on handling real-life patients. You will be mostly performing more advanced duties like needle injection and infusion (IV), airway tubing, vacuum suctioning, ECG and pre-hospital ACLS routines, advanced spine management, extreme traumatic injuries, inter- and post-natal emergencies, and first aid that an NSF medic isn't expected to handle. You will also be learning on field management (e.g. radio reporting, situational awareness etc.) to complement your paramedicine duties. Afterwards, you will be tested, and you need to pass 80% of your assessments to advance to the next level of paramedicine. Only after the completion of 3 years of training will you be officially a paramedic.  Afterwards, you are attached to a fire station, still, not sure if by choice or by current allocation. You have two overall in charge: the commanding officer for the fire station, and the paramedic officer-in-charge of EMS. You will follow the regulations as set by the fire station CO, (as an overall leader in charge of the fire station representing SCDF at large), and you will follow the occupation regulations as set forth by the OIC (operational procedures, case paperwork, medical logistics etc.). Depending on your level of experience, you can be seconded as an assistant to the OIC, or you can be posted as a fast-response paramedic (usually it's performed by paramedics converted from fire and rescue units).  Most firefighters are OK with paramedics, but because the operational framework is different (one deals with fires and rescue operations, the other, fixing the human body so that it survives the hsopital trip) the only other time you get together is in drills and exercises, as well as station bonding activities and various inter-department and inter-division activities. If firefighters are physically shiong, you, as a paramedic, it's a mental shiong.  Rewards may/may not include: letter of commendation by members of the public, appearing in newspapers, service awards. Not so nice things include: public complaints, which may affect your performance bonus.  Last but not least, at the very least, you are serving for a noble cause. May you live long and prosper, and may the odds be ever in your favour. Good luck.",13.659517991693715
