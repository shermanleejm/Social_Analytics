NUS biz is surely harder to score. NBS average bellcurve lies at around B+ while NUS biz lies around B.

But i heard stories from senior that there are people who don't even teach their friends as they think it's damn stupid to help them due to the bellcurve. Personal feeling, people who refuses to teach generally do not score very well hence they feel insecure. For any of the peeps here, whatever course you go to, ignore the bell curve and teach. Nothing aid learning better than teaching your peers.averagewee wrote:  so far i haven't memorize anything for biz leh. Mostly got cheatsheet and biz cannot really memorize la. need quite a lot of critical thinking in some way. Biz in uni is quite different from poly in some way. Agreed, it works for NBS too. Not much memorization need with so many mod having open book and cheatsheet. Mods that i memorised generally only score a B+ or so because i fail to understand the concepts. Mod that i score A/ A+ hardly require much memorising since I get the concepts. Main point is that in Uni learn to understand and not memorise, non of the dean listers I see uses pure memory.

Congrats on being shortlisted for SMU SIS interview! First and foremost, you can find numerous blogs and forums with information about the interview. That aside, I've just went for the interview on 9th April and have just received an acceptance email today. So I will be actually telling you what to expect for the interview but it may differ. Firstly, it is a group interview which  consists of 2 interviewers (professors) and 6 interviewees including you. Upon arrival, you will be led to a room by current SIS student volunteers where they will brief you through the interview progress. You will then be given 15 minutes to complete a form whereby you have to state specific examples of certain characteristics and traits (eg. Leadership, curiosity etc). On the same form you have to list down 3 questions you wanna ask the professors. Another 15 minutes will be given to you to design (sketch on a black paper) a Web page depending on the case study. Once completed, you will be led to another room where the interviewers will already be seated. One by one, you have to present your design to everybody. Do expect some questions to be asked by the professors pertaining to your design.  Next comes the famous SMU estimation question and you have 4 minutes to write down your answer on a piece of paper. The question I received was, "How many A4 sized papers are used for exam questions in SMU per semester." They do not care about your final answer but are more concern on your thought process. So make realistic and sound assumptions before arriving to your final answer. The professors may ask the origin of your assumption. So make sure you know how to explain. Lastly, the interview will end of with a Q&A session whereby questions you have listed on earlier will be answered. Do not list down questions which can be easily found on SMU's website.  Be confident and show your passion towards IS while presenting your ideas. SMU SIS looks for students who are able to analyse problems fast with critical thinking skills. As long as you make an effort to prepare for the interview, you have won half of the battle.

Firstly, it is a group interview which  consists of 2 interviewers (professors) and 6 interviewees including you. Upon arrival, you will be led to a room by current SIS student volunteers where they will brief you through the interview progress. You will then be given 15 minutes to complete a form whereby you have to state specific examples of certain characteristics and traits (eg. Leadership, curiosity etc). On the same form you have to list down 3 questions you wanna ask the professors. Another 15 minutes will be given to you to design (sketch on a black paper) a Web page depending on the case study. Once completed, you will be led to another room where the interviewers will already be seated. One by one, you have to present your design to everybody. Do expect some questions to be asked by the professors pertaining to your design.  Next comes the famous SMU estimation question and you have 4 minutes to write down your answer on a piece of paper. The question I received was, "How many A4 sized papers are used for exam questions in SMU per semester." They do not care about your final answer but are more concern on your thought process. So make realistic and sound assumptions before arriving to your final answer. The professors may ask the origin of your assumption. So make sure you know how to explain. Lastly, the interview will end of with a Q&A session whereby questions you have listed on earlier will be answered. Do not list down questions which can be easily found on SMU's website.  Be confident and show your passion towards IS while presenting your ideas. SMU SIS looks for students who are able to analyse problems fast with critical thinking skills.

I took amaths and economics during my secondary and poly time respectively. I also applied for nus fass for the previous 2 years, but they rejected me too which i dunno why.  Could it be the reason that i am serving ns now? I kinda at a loss about what to do. I dont really wanna go SIM with my gpa! No! In fact, NS should be an advantage especially if you get into command school! (That is also considered a non-accademic achievement) Other awards like best soldier may help too! NS is the best time to talk about your experiences and what made you decide (forgive me if I sound too drama or cliche) on going into that dream course! NTU/NUS/SMU requires students to write more about themselves for the courses they require to get into/why and there is a portion for non-accademic achievements. Remember to fill that up! Don't think it is not important because there are many people with the same GPA as you, so how do they consider applicants? To see if they have any additional talents/achievements they can bring with them outside their GPA!!! I cannot stress this enough, especially if you are from a poly! Also, I feel you about not being able to get into a local university of my choice! I screwed up my admission to get into my several dream courses at various Local U's during the first year because I thought they only look at GPA, and hence I didn't really bother much with the interview/and did not fill my non-CCA achievements. I thought I would definitely secure a place butI was so FRIGGIN WRONG. I felt like I was going to die literally because I couldn't get into a Local U. It was awful because I worked so friggin hard in poly D': Fortunately, I managed to pull myself together and manage to not screw up the second time and got into a local U with a course of my choice  So, DONT GIVE UP BRO. Now that you are closer to ORD, find some time to improve yourself, hunt down your poly lecturer to write you that testimonial letter for your university admission as they will really help. You are a merit holder, I am sure you have worked hard for it and paid attention during leessons. Your lecturers 会给你面子 if you are sincere and ask nicely!   If all else fails, there is always a local university route outside of NTU/NUS and it can be even better than the two.. but I can't say here.. later people will think I am biased towards certain university...

NUS cannot choose their specialisation as what they wish, CAP is still a consideration. So far the only subject I have trouble understanding the lecturer is stats, most prof are Singaporean and speak rather well.

I think you shouldn't get too caught up with reputation right now, it is something that shouldn't take precedence over your interests and your desired career - mainly because it isn't as important as you think it is. I've a senior, an IP student from one of the top JCs who scored straight B's for his A levels did not get called for an interview for his 1st nor 2nd choice at SMU. Fella decided to go to SIM to pursue his studies in a similar field and is earning quite a lot working as a trader for a fund now.  There are a lot of ways you can monetize your degree - as long as you are doing what you want to do you will think of ways to do so. If you're going to do Jap studies but you're interested in Finance, then do take some finance mods if that is possible, join a finance CCA, take up CFA, participate in competitions, write a paper on Japan and show your employer that you are well versed with Jap culture and at the same time highly passionate (and active) in the finance side of things - you will be an amazing hire for a company looking to expand into / their operations in Japan.  It is important for us not to get caught up with the rankings. I cannot stress this enough - at the end of the day, it is who you are, what you've done and how you're working towards your goals that matter, not the reputation of your University.  Just to share: the decision for me was simple back then - I've sorted out my interests, understood what I needed to do... so I picked the one that's closest to where I live  And my parents are both members of KRGH so that made the choice even more obvious! Thanks for the great advice!  I am offered to do Linguistics in NTU, and it's a more attractive offer now especially since I am offered a scholarship there. The truth is, I love languages, and I'm obsessed with Japanese as well. Been learning the language since P5, over 9 years liao. Been exposed to the culture since I was born, so I am very influenced and in love with it. But still, I don't really see the point in doing Japanese Studies.  I am a Tourism/Business student in NP, so I have both business and hospitality backgrounds to fall upon. I am thinking of being a translator/interpreter, but doing Jap Studies would be pointless since I can't just concentrate on just one language. Being an Eng teacher in Japan would be nice as well, and that would require linguistics studies... The worst thing is, both degrees have one of the lowest starting salary among all the degrees, am now hesitating on whether to appeal to NBS instead... :/ cGPA: ard 3.82 O level: L1R5=4, L1R4=6",11.540850945575315

Firstly, it is a group interview which  consists of 2 interviewers (professors) and 6 interviewees including you. Upon arrival, you will be led to a room by current SIS student volunteers where they will brief you through the interview progress. You will then be given 15 minutes to complete a form whereby you have to state specific examples of certain characteristics and traits (eg. Leadership, curiosity etc). On the same form you have to list down 3 questions you wanna ask the professors. Another 15 minutes will be given to you to design (sketch on a black paper) a Web page depending on the case study. Once completed, you will be led to another room where the interviewers will already be seated. One by one, you have to present your design to everybody. Do expect some questions to be asked by the professors pertaining to your design.  Next comes the famous SMU estimation question and you have 4 minutes to write down your answer on a piece of paper. The question I received was, "How many A4 sized papers are used for exam questions in SMU per semester." They do not care about your final answer but are more concern on your thought process.

NS is the best time to talk about your experiences and what made you decide (forgive me if I sound too drama or cliche) on going into that dream course! NTU/NUS/SMU requires students to write more about themselves for the courses they require to get into/why and there is a portion for non-accademic achievements. Remember to fill that up! Don't think it is not important because there are many people with the same GPA as you, so how do they consider applicants? To see if they have any additional talents/achievements they can bring with them outside their GPA!!! I cannot stress this enough, especially if you are from a poly! Also, I feel you about not being able to get into a local university of my choice! I screwed up my admission to get into my several dream courses at various Local U's during the first year because I thought they only look at GPA, and hence I didn't really bother much with the interview/and did not fill my non-CCA achievements. I thought I would definitely secure a place butI was so FRIGGIN WRONG. I felt like I was going to die literally because I couldn't get into a Local U. It was awful because I worked so friggin hard in poly D': Fortunately, I managed to pull myself together and manage to not screw up the second time and got into a local U with a course of my choice  So, DONT GIVE UP BRO. Now that you are closer to ORD, find some time to improve yourself, hunt down your poly lecturer to write you that testimonial letter for your university admission as they will really help. You are a merit holder, I am sure you have worked hard for it and paid attention during leessons. Your lecturers 会给你面子 if you are sincere and ask nicely!   If all else fails, there is always a local university route outside of NTU/NUS and it can be even better than the two.. but I can't say here.. later people will think I am biased towards certain university...

NUS cannot choose their specialisation as what they wish, CAP is still a consideration. So far the only subject I have trouble understanding the lecturer is stats, most prof are Singaporean and speak rather well. Also, I survive 80% of my modules without the textbooks, notes are generally sufficient. Lastly, I have more NUS friends regretting not coming NBS instead.

I think you shouldn't get too caught up with reputation right now, it is something that shouldn't take precedence over your interests and your desired career - mainly because it isn't as important as you think it is. I've a senior, an IP student from one of the top JCs who scored straight B's for his A levels did not get called for an interview for his 1st nor 2nd choice at SMU. Fella decided to go to SIM to pursue his studies in a similar field and is earning quite a lot working as a trader for a fund now.  There are a lot of ways you can monetize your degree - as long as you are doing what you want to do you will think of ways to do so. If you're going to do Jap studies but you're interested in Finance, then do take some finance mods if that is possible, join a finance CCA, take up CFA, participate in competitions, write a paper on Japan and show your employer that you are well versed with Jap culture and at the same time highly passionate (and active) in the finance side of things - you will be an amazing hire for a company looking to expand into / their operations in Japan.  It is important for us not to get caught up with the rankings. I cannot stress this enough - at the end of the day, it is who you are, what you've done and how you're working towards your goals that matter, not the reputation of your University.  Just to share: the decision for me was simple back then - I've sorted out my interests, understood what I needed to do... so I picked the one that's closest to where I live  And my parents are both members of KRGH so that made the choice even more obvious! Thanks for the great advice!  I am offered to do Linguistics in NTU, and it's a more attractive offer now especially since I am offered a scholarship there. The truth is, I love languages, and I'm obsessed with Japanese as well. Been learning the language since P5, over 9 years liao. Been exposed to the culture since I was born, so I am very influenced and in love with it. But still, I don't really see the point in doing Japanese Studies.  I am a Tourism/Business student in NP, so I have both business and hospitality backgrounds to fall upon. I am thinking of being a translator/interpreter, but doing Jap Studies would be pointless since I can't just concentrate on just one language. Being an Eng teacher in Japan would be nice as well, and that would require linguistics studies... The worst thing is, both degrees have one of the lowest starting salary among all the degrees, am now hesitating on whether to appeal to NBS instead... :/ cGPA: ard 3.82 O level: L1R5=4, L1R4=6",11.431487001562758

And what's with the BIZ anal flip class room thing. really makes me feel like flipping table instead. lol but nus biz is copying smu in some ways. even our profs are comparing.

Personal feeling, people who refuses to teach generally do not score very well hence they feel insecure. For any of the peeps here, whatever course you go to, ignore the bell curve and teach. Nothing aid learning better than teaching your peers.averagewee wrote:  so far i haven't memorize anything for biz leh.

Mod that i score A/ A+ hardly require much memorising since I get the concepts. Main point is that in Uni learn to understand and not memorise, non of the dean listers I see uses pure memory.

That aside, I've just went for the interview on 9th April and have just received an acceptance email today. So I will be actually telling you what to expect for the interview but it may differ. Firstly, it is a group interview which  consists of 2 interviewers (professors) and 6 interviewees including you. Upon arrival, you will be led to a room by current SIS student volunteers where they will brief you through the interview progress. You will then be given 15 minutes to complete a form whereby you have to state specific examples of certain characteristics and traits (eg. Leadership, curiosity etc). On the same form you have to list down 3 questions you wanna ask the professors. Another 15 minutes will be given to you to design (sketch on a black paper) a Web page depending on the case study. Once completed, you will be led to another room where the interviewers will already be seated. One by one, you have to present your design to everybody. Do expect some questions to be asked by the professors pertaining to your design.  Next comes the famous SMU estimation question and you have 4 minutes to write down your answer on a piece of paper. The question I received was, "How many A4 sized papers are used for exam questions in SMU per semester." They do not care about your final answer but are more concern on your thought process. So make realistic and sound assumptions before arriving to your final answer. The professors may ask the origin of your assumption. So make sure you know how to explain. Lastly, the interview will end of with a Q&A session whereby questions you have listed on earlier will be answered. Do not list down questions which can be easily found on SMU's website.  Be confident and show your passion towards IS while presenting your ideas. SMU SIS looks for students who are able to analyse problems fast with critical thinking skills. As long as you make an effort to prepare for the interview, you have won half of the battle.

In fact, NS should be an advantage especially if you get into command school! (That is also considered a non-accademic achievement) Other awards like best soldier may help too! NS is the best time to talk about your experiences and what made you decide (forgive me if I sound too drama or cliche) on going into that dream course! NTU/NUS/SMU requires students to write more about themselves for the courses they require to get into/why and there is a portion for non-accademic achievements. Remember to fill that up! Don't think it is not important because there are many people with the same GPA as you, so how do they consider applicants? To see if they have any additional talents/achievements they can bring with them outside their GPA!!! I cannot stress this enough, especially if you are from a poly! Also, I feel you about not being able to get into a local university of my choice! I screwed up my admission to get into my several dream courses at various Local U's during the first year because I thought they only look at GPA, and hence I didn't really bother much with the interview/and did not fill my non-CCA achievements. I thought I would definitely secure a place butI was so FRIGGIN WRONG. I felt like I was going to die literally because I couldn't get into a Local U. It was awful because I worked so friggin hard in poly D': Fortunately, I managed to pull myself together and manage to not screw up the second time and got into a local U with a course of my choice  So, DONT GIVE UP BRO. Now that you are closer to ORD, find some time to improve yourself, hunt down your poly lecturer to write you that testimonial letter for your university admission as they will really help. You are a merit holder, I am sure you have worked hard for it and paid attention during leessons. Your lecturers 会给你面子 if you are sincere and ask nicely!   If all else fails, there is always a local university route outside of NTU/NUS and it can be even better than the two.. but I can't say here.. later people will think I am biased towards certain university...

I think you shouldn't get too caught up with reputation right now, it is something that shouldn't take precedence over your interests and your desired career - mainly because it isn't as important as you think it is. I've a senior, an IP student from one of the top JCs who scored straight B's for his A levels did not get called for an interview for his 1st nor 2nd choice at SMU. Fella decided to go to SIM to pursue his studies in a similar field and is earning quite a lot working as a trader for a fund now.  There are a lot of ways you can monetize your degree - as long as you are doing what you want to do you will think of ways to do so. If you're going to do Jap studies but you're interested in Finance, then do take some finance mods if that is possible, join a finance CCA, take up CFA, participate in competitions, write a paper on Japan and show your employer that you are well versed with Jap culture and at the same time highly passionate (and active) in the finance side of things - you will be an amazing hire for a company looking to expand into / their operations in Japan.  It is important for us not to get caught up with the rankings. I cannot stress this enough - at the end of the day, it is who you are, what you've done and how you're working towards your goals that matter, not the reputation of your University.  Just to share: the decision for me was simple back then - I've sorted out my interests, understood what I needed to do... so I picked the one that's closest to where I live  And my parents are both members of KRGH so that made the choice even more obvious! Thanks for the great advice!  I am offered to do Linguistics in NTU, and it's a more attractive offer now especially since I am offered a scholarship there. The truth is, I love languages, and I'm obsessed with Japanese as well. Been learning the language since P5, over 9 years liao. Been exposed to the culture since I was born, so I am very influenced and in love with it. But still, I don't really see the point in doing Japanese Studies.  I am a Tourism/Business student in NP, so I have both business and hospitality backgrounds to fall upon. I am thinking of being a translator/interpreter, but doing Jap Studies would be pointless since I can't just concentrate on just one language. Being an Eng teacher in Japan would be nice as well, and that would require linguistics studies... The worst thing is, both degrees have one of the lowest starting salary among all the degrees, am now hesitating on whether to appeal to NBS instead... :/ cGPA: ard 3.82 O level: L1R5=4, L1R4=6",11.452849134531945

Could it be the reason that i am serving ns now? I kinda at a loss about what to do. I dont really wanna go SIM with my gpa! No! In fact, NS should be an advantage especially if you get into command school! (That is also considered a non-accademic achievement) Other awards like best soldier may help too! NS is the best time to talk about your experiences and what made you decide (forgive me if I sound too drama or cliche) on going into that dream course! NTU/NUS/SMU requires students to write more about themselves for the courses they require to get into/why and there is a portion for non-accademic achievements. Remember to fill that up! Don't think it is not important because there are many people with the same GPA as you, so how do they consider applicants? To see if they have any additional talents/achievements they can bring with them outside their GPA!!! I cannot stress this enough, especially if you are from a poly! Also, I feel you about not being able to get into a local university of my choice! I screwed up my admission to get into my several dream courses at various Local U's during the first year because I thought they only look at GPA, and hence I didn't really bother much with the interview/and did not fill my non-CCA achievements. I thought I would definitely secure a place butI was so FRIGGIN WRONG. I felt like I was going to die literally because I couldn't get into a Local U. It was awful because I worked so friggin hard in poly D': Fortunately, I managed to pull myself together and manage to not screw up the second time and got into a local U with a course of my choice  So, DONT GIVE UP BRO. Now that you are closer to ORD, find some time to improve yourself, hunt down your poly lecturer to write you that testimonial letter for your university admission as they will really help. You are a merit holder, I am sure you have worked hard for it and paid attention during leessons. Your lecturers 会给你面子 if you are sincere and ask nicely!   If all else fails, there is always a local university route outside of NTU/NUS and it can be even better than the two.. but I can't say here.. later people will think I am biased towards certain university...

NUS cannot choose their specialisation as what they wish, CAP is still a consideration. So far the only subject I have trouble understanding the lecturer is stats, most prof are Singaporean and speak rather well. Also, I survive 80% of my modules without the textbooks, notes are generally sufficient. Lastly, I have more NUS friends regretting not coming NBS instead.

I think you shouldn't get too caught up with reputation right now, it is something that shouldn't take precedence over your interests and your desired career - mainly because it isn't as important as you think it is. I've a senior, an IP student from one of the top JCs who scored straight B's for his A levels did not get called for an interview for his 1st nor 2nd choice at SMU. Fella decided to go to SIM to pursue his studies in a similar field and is earning quite a lot working as a trader for a fund now.  There are a lot of ways you can monetize your degree - as long as you are doing what you want to do you will think of ways to do so. If you're going to do Jap studies but you're interested in Finance, then do take some finance mods if that is possible, join a finance CCA, take up CFA, participate in competitions, write a paper on Japan and show your employer that you are well versed with Jap culture and at the same time highly passionate (and active) in the finance side of things - you will be an amazing hire for a company looking to expand into / their operations in Japan.  It is important for us not to get caught up with the rankings. I cannot stress this enough - at the end of the day, it is who you are, what you've done and how you're working towards your goals that matter, not the reputation of your University.  Just to share: the decision for me was simple back then - I've sorted out my interests, understood what I needed to do... so I picked the one that's closest to where I live  And my parents are both members of KRGH so that made the choice even more obvious! Thanks for the great advice!  I am offered to do Linguistics in NTU, and it's a more attractive offer now especially since I am offered a scholarship there. The truth is, I love languages, and I'm obsessed with Japanese as well. Been learning the language since P5, over 9 years liao. Been exposed to the culture since I was born, so I am very influenced and in love with it. But still, I don't really see the point in doing Japanese Studies.  I am a Tourism/Business student in NP, so I have both business and hospitality backgrounds to fall upon. I am thinking of being a translator/interpreter, but doing Jap Studies would be pointless since I can't just concentrate on just one language. Being an Eng teacher in Japan would be nice as well, and that would require linguistics studies... The worst thing is, both degrees have one of the lowest starting salary among all the degrees, am now hesitating on whether to appeal to NBS instead... :/ cGPA: ard 3.82 O level: L1R5=4, L1R4=6",11.452849134531945

And what's with the BIZ anal flip class room thing. really makes me feel like flipping table instead. lol but nus biz is copying smu in some ways. even our profs are comparing.

Nothing aid learning better than teaching your peers.averagewee wrote:  so far i haven't memorize anything for biz leh.

Mod that i score A/ A+ hardly require much memorising since I get the concepts. Main point is that in Uni learn to understand and not memorise, non of the dean listers I see uses pure memory.

First and foremost, you can find numerous blogs and forums with information about the interview. That aside, I've just went for the interview on 9th April and have just received an acceptance email today. So I will be actually telling you what to expect for the interview but it may differ. Firstly, it is a group interview which  consists of 2 interviewers (professors) and 6 interviewees including you. Upon arrival, you will be led to a room by current SIS student volunteers where they will brief you through the interview progress. You will then be given 15 minutes to complete a form whereby you have to state specific examples of certain characteristics and traits (eg. Leadership, curiosity etc). On the same form you have to list down 3 questions you wanna ask the professors. Another 15 minutes will be given to you to design (sketch on a black paper) a Web page depending on the case study. Once completed, you will be led to another room where the interviewers will already be seated. One by one, you have to present your design to everybody. Do expect some questions to be asked by the professors pertaining to your design.  Next comes the famous SMU estimation question and you have 4 minutes to write down your answer on a piece of paper. The question I received was, "How many A4 sized papers are used for exam questions in SMU per semester." They do not care about your final answer but are more concern on your thought process. So make realistic and sound assumptions before arriving to your final answer. The professors may ask the origin of your assumption. So make sure you know how to explain. Lastly, the interview will end of with a Q&A session whereby questions you have listed on earlier will be answered. Do not list down questions which can be easily found on SMU's website.  Be confident and show your passion towards IS while presenting your ideas. SMU SIS looks for students who are able to analyse problems fast with critical thinking skills. As long as you make an effort to prepare for the interview, you have won half of the battle.

Could it be the reason that i am serving ns now? I kinda at a loss about what to do. I dont really wanna go SIM with my gpa! No! In fact, NS should be an advantage especially if you get into command school! (That is also considered a non-accademic achievement) Other awards like best soldier may help too! NS is the best time to talk about your experiences and what made you decide (forgive me if I sound too drama or cliche) on going into that dream course! NTU/NUS/SMU requires students to write more about themselves for the courses they require to get into/why and there is a portion for non-accademic achievements. Remember to fill that up! Don't think it is not important because there are many people with the same GPA as you, so how do they consider applicants? To see if they have any additional talents/achievements they can bring with them outside their GPA!!! I cannot stress this enough, especially if you are from a poly! Also, I feel you about not being able to get into a local university of my choice! I screwed up my admission to get into my several dream courses at various Local U's during the first year because I thought they only look at GPA, and hence I didn't really bother much with the interview/and did not fill my non-CCA achievements. I thought I would definitely secure a place butI was so FRIGGIN WRONG. I felt like I was going to die literally because I couldn't get into a Local U. It was awful because I worked so friggin hard in poly D': Fortunately, I managed to pull myself together and manage to not screw up the second time and got into a local U with a course of my choice  So, DONT GIVE UP BRO. Now that you are closer to ORD, find some time to improve yourself, hunt down your poly lecturer to write you that testimonial letter for your university admission as they will really help. You are a merit holder, I am sure you have worked hard for it and paid attention during leessons. Your lecturers 会给你面子 if you are sincere and ask nicely!   If all else fails, there is always a local university route outside of NTU/NUS and it can be even better than the two.. but I can't say here.. later people will think I am biased towards certain university...

NUS cannot choose their specialisation as what they wish, CAP is still a consideration. So far the only subject I have trouble understanding the lecturer is stats, most prof are Singaporean and speak rather well. Also, I survive 80% of my modules without the textbooks, notes are generally sufficient. Lastly, I have more NUS friends regretting not coming NBS instead.

I think you shouldn't get too caught up with reputation right now, it is something that shouldn't take precedence over your interests and your desired career - mainly because it isn't as important as you think it is. I've a senior, an IP student from one of the top JCs who scored straight B's for his A levels did not get called for an interview for his 1st nor 2nd choice at SMU. Fella decided to go to SIM to pursue his studies in a similar field and is earning quite a lot working as a trader for a fund now.  There are a lot of ways you can monetize your degree - as long as you are doing what you want to do you will think of ways to do so. If you're going to do Jap studies but you're interested in Finance, then do take some finance mods if that is possible, join a finance CCA, take up CFA, participate in competitions, write a paper on Japan and show your employer that you are well versed with Jap culture and at the same time highly passionate (and active) in the finance side of things - you will be an amazing hire for a company looking to expand into / their operations in Japan.  It is important for us not to get caught up with the rankings. I cannot stress this enough - at the end of the day, it is who you are, what you've done and how you're working towards your goals that matter, not the reputation of your University.  Just to share: the decision for me was simple back then - I've sorted out my interests, understood what I needed to do... so I picked the one that's closest to where I live  And my parents are both members of KRGH so that made the choice even more obvious! Thanks for the great advice!  I am offered to do Linguistics in NTU, and it's a more attractive offer now especially since I am offered a scholarship there. The truth is, I love languages, and I'm obsessed with Japanese as well. Been learning the language since P5, over 9 years liao. Been exposed to the culture since I was born, so I am very influenced and in love with it. But still, I don't really see the point in doing Japanese Studies.  I am a Tourism/Business student in NP, so I have both business and hospitality backgrounds to fall upon. I am thinking of being a translator/interpreter, but doing Jap Studies would be pointless since I can't just concentrate on just one language. Being an Eng teacher in Japan would be nice as well, and that would require linguistics studies... The worst thing is, both degrees have one of the lowest starting salary among all the degrees, am now hesitating on whether to appeal to NBS instead... :/ cGPA: ard 3.82 O level: L1R5=4, L1R4=6",11.452849134531945

That aside, I've just went for the interview on 9th April and have just received an acceptance email today. So I will be actually telling you what to expect for the interview but it may differ. Firstly, it is a group interview which  consists of 2 interviewers (professors) and 6 interviewees including you. Upon arrival, you will be led to a room by current SIS student volunteers where they will brief you through the interview progress. You will then be given 15 minutes to complete a form whereby you have to state specific examples of certain characteristics and traits (eg. Leadership, curiosity etc). On the same form you have to list down 3 questions you wanna ask the professors. Another 15 minutes will be given to you to design (sketch on a black paper) a Web page depending on the case study. Once completed, you will be led to another room where the interviewers will already be seated. One by one, you have to present your design to everybody. Do expect some questions to be asked by the professors pertaining to your design.  Next comes the famous SMU estimation question and you have 4 minutes to write down your answer on a piece of paper. The question I received was, "How many A4 sized papers are used for exam questions in SMU per semester." They do not care about your final answer but are more concern on your thought process. So make realistic and sound assumptions before arriving to your final answer. The professors may ask the origin of your assumption. So make sure you know how to explain.

NS is the best time to talk about your experiences and what made you decide (forgive me if I sound too drama or cliche) on going into that dream course! NTU/NUS/SMU requires students to write more about themselves for the courses they require to get into/why and there is a portion for non-accademic achievements. Remember to fill that up! Don't think it is not important because there are many people with the same GPA as you, so how do they consider applicants? To see if they have any additional talents/achievements they can bring with them outside their GPA!!! I cannot stress this enough, especially if you are from a poly! Also, I feel you about not being able to get into a local university of my choice! I screwed up my admission to get into my several dream courses at various Local U's during the first year because I thought they only look at GPA, and hence I didn't really bother much with the interview/and did not fill my non-CCA achievements. I thought I would definitely secure a place butI was so FRIGGIN WRONG. I felt like I was going to die literally because I couldn't get into a Local U. It was awful because I worked so friggin hard in poly D': Fortunately, I managed to pull myself together and manage to not screw up the second time and got into a local U with a course of my choice  So, DONT GIVE UP BRO. Now that you are closer to ORD, find some time to improve yourself, hunt down your poly lecturer to write you that testimonial letter for your university admission as they will really help. You are a merit holder, I am sure you have worked hard for it and paid attention during leessons. Your lecturers 会给你面子 if you are sincere and ask nicely!   If all else fails, there is always a local university route outside of NTU/NUS and it can be even better than the two.. but I can't say here.. later people will think I am biased towards certain university...

I took blaw before and I don't remember any streaming video whatsoever. Recorded lecture is made available only to aid students who miss / have doubt after the lectures. NUS cannot choose their specialisation as what they wish, CAP is still a consideration. So far the only subject I have trouble understanding the lecturer is stats, most prof are Singaporean and speak rather well. Also, I survive 80% of my modules without the textbooks, notes are generally sufficient. Lastly, I have more NUS friends regretting not coming NBS instead.

I think you shouldn't get too caught up with reputation right now, it is something that shouldn't take precedence over your interests and your desired career - mainly because it isn't as important as you think it is. I've a senior, an IP student from one of the top JCs who scored straight B's for his A levels did not get called for an interview for his 1st nor 2nd choice at SMU. Fella decided to go to SIM to pursue his studies in a similar field and is earning quite a lot working as a trader for a fund now.  There are a lot of ways you can monetize your degree - as long as you are doing what you want to do you will think of ways to do so. If you're going to do Jap studies but you're interested in Finance, then do take some finance mods if that is possible, join a finance CCA, take up CFA, participate in competitions, write a paper on Japan and show your employer that you are well versed with Jap culture and at the same time highly passionate (and active) in the finance side of things - you will be an amazing hire for a company looking to expand into / their operations in Japan.  It is important for us not to get caught up with the rankings. I cannot stress this enough - at the end of the day, it is who you are, what you've done and how you're working towards your goals that matter, not the reputation of your University.  Just to share: the decision for me was simple back then - I've sorted out my interests, understood what I needed to do... so I picked the one that's closest to where I live  And my parents are both members of KRGH so that made the choice even more obvious! Thanks for the great advice!  I am offered to do Linguistics in NTU, and it's a more attractive offer now especially since I am offered a scholarship there. The truth is, I love languages, and I'm obsessed with Japanese as well. Been learning the language since P5, over 9 years liao. Been exposed to the culture since I was born, so I am very influenced and in love with it. But still, I don't really see the point in doing Japanese Studies.  I am a Tourism/Business student in NP, so I have both business and hospitality backgrounds to fall upon. I am thinking of being a translator/interpreter, but doing Jap Studies would be pointless since I can't just concentrate on just one language. Being an Eng teacher in Japan would be nice as well, and that would require linguistics studies... The worst thing is, both degrees have one of the lowest starting salary among all the degrees, am now hesitating on whether to appeal to NBS instead... :/ cGPA: ard 3.82 O level: L1R5=4, L1R4=6",11.452849134531945

And what's with the BIZ anal flip class room thing. really makes me feel like flipping table instead. lol but nus biz is copying smu in some ways. even our profs are comparing.

Personal feeling, people who refuses to teach generally do not score very well hence they feel insecure. For any of the peeps here, whatever course you go to, ignore the bell curve and teach. Nothing aid learning better than teaching your peers.averagewee wrote:  so far i haven't memorize anything for biz leh.

Mod that i score A/ A+ hardly require much memorising since I get the concepts. Main point is that in Uni learn to understand and not memorise, non of the dean listers I see uses pure memory.

Mod that i score A/ A+ hardly require much memorising since I get the concepts. Main point is that in Uni learn to understand and not memorise, non of the dean listers I see uses pure memory.

That aside, I've just went for the interview on 9th April and have just received an acceptance email today. So I will be actually telling you what to expect for the interview but it may differ. Firstly, it is a group interview which  consists of 2 interviewers (professors) and 6 interviewees including you. Upon arrival, you will be led to a room by current SIS student volunteers where they will brief you through the interview progress. You will then be given 15 minutes to complete a form whereby you have to state specific examples of certain characteristics and traits (eg. Leadership, curiosity etc). On the same form you have to list down 3 questions you wanna ask the professors. Another 15 minutes will be given to you to design (sketch on a black paper) a Web page depending on the case study. Once completed, you will be led to another room where the interviewers will already be seated. One by one, you have to present your design to everybody. Do expect some questions to be asked by the professors pertaining to your design.  Next comes the famous SMU estimation question and you have 4 minutes to write down your answer on a piece of paper. The question I received was, "How many A4 sized papers are used for exam questions in SMU per semester." They do not care about your final answer but are more concern on your thought process. So make realistic and sound assumptions before arriving to your final answer. The professors may ask the origin of your assumption. So make sure you know how to explain. Lastly, the interview will end of with a Q&A session whereby questions you have listed on earlier will be answered. Do not list down questions which can be easily found on SMU's website.  Be confident and show your passion towards IS while presenting your ideas. SMU SIS looks for students who are able to analyse problems fast with critical thinking skills.

Could it be the reason that i am serving ns now? I kinda at a loss about what to do. I dont really wanna go SIM with my gpa! No! In fact, NS should be an advantage especially if you get into command school! (That is also considered a non-accademic achievement) Other awards like best soldier may help too! NS is the best time to talk about your experiences and what made you decide (forgive me if I sound too drama or cliche) on going into that dream course! NTU/NUS/SMU requires students to write more about themselves for the courses they require to get into/why and there is a portion for non-accademic achievements. Remember to fill that up! Don't think it is not important because there are many people with the same GPA as you, so how do they consider applicants? To see if they have any additional talents/achievements they can bring with them outside their GPA!!! I cannot stress this enough, especially if you are from a poly! Also, I feel you about not being able to get into a local university of my choice! I screwed up my admission to get into my several dream courses at various Local U's during the first year because I thought they only look at GPA, and hence I didn't really bother much with the interview/and did not fill my non-CCA achievements. I thought I would definitely secure a place butI was so FRIGGIN WRONG. I felt like I was going to die literally because I couldn't get into a Local U. It was awful because I worked so friggin hard in poly D': Fortunately, I managed to pull myself together and manage to not screw up the second time and got into a local U with a course of my choice  So, DONT GIVE UP BRO. Now that you are closer to ORD, find some time to improve yourself, hunt down your poly lecturer to write you that testimonial letter for your university admission as they will really help. You are a merit holder, I am sure you have worked hard for it and paid attention during leessons. Your lecturers 会给你面子 if you are sincere and ask nicely!   If all else fails, there is always a local university route outside of NTU/NUS and it can be even better than the two.. but I can't say here.. later people will think I am biased towards certain university...

NUS cannot choose their specialisation as what they wish, CAP is still a consideration. So far the only subject I have trouble understanding the lecturer is stats, most prof are Singaporean and speak rather well. Also, I survive 80% of my modules without the textbooks, notes are generally sufficient. Lastly, I have more NUS friends regretting not coming NBS instead.

I think you shouldn't get too caught up with reputation right now, it is something that shouldn't take precedence over your interests and your desired career - mainly because it isn't as important as you think it is. I've a senior, an IP student from one of the top JCs who scored straight B's for his A levels did not get called for an interview for his 1st nor 2nd choice at SMU. Fella decided to go to SIM to pursue his studies in a similar field and is earning quite a lot working as a trader for a fund now.  There are a lot of ways you can monetize your degree - as long as you are doing what you want to do you will think of ways to do so. If you're going to do Jap studies but you're interested in Finance, then do take some finance mods if that is possible, join a finance CCA, take up CFA, participate in competitions, write a paper on Japan and show your employer that you are well versed with Jap culture and at the same time highly passionate (and active) in the finance side of things - you will be an amazing hire for a company looking to expand into / their operations in Japan.  It is important for us not to get caught up with the rankings. I cannot stress this enough - at the end of the day, it is who you are, what you've done and how you're working towards your goals that matter, not the reputation of your University.  Just to share: the decision for me was simple back then - I've sorted out my interests, understood what I needed to do... so I picked the one that's closest to where I live  And my parents are both members of KRGH so that made the choice even more obvious! Thanks for the great advice!  I am offered to do Linguistics in NTU, and it's a more attractive offer now especially since I am offered a scholarship there. The truth is, I love languages, and I'm obsessed with Japanese as well. Been learning the language since P5, over 9 years liao. Been exposed to the culture since I was born, so I am very influenced and in love with it. But still, I don't really see the point in doing Japanese Studies.  I am a Tourism/Business student in NP, so I have both business and hospitality backgrounds to fall upon. I am thinking of being a translator/interpreter, but doing Jap Studies would be pointless since I can't just concentrate on just one language. Being an Eng teacher in Japan would be nice as well, and that would require linguistics studies... The worst thing is, both degrees have one of the lowest starting salary among all the degrees, am now hesitating on whether to appeal to NBS instead... :/ cGPA: ard 3.82 O level: L1R5=4, L1R4=6",11.452849134531945

Firstly, it is a group interview which  consists of 2 interviewers (professors) and 6 interviewees including you. Upon arrival, you will be led to a room by current SIS student volunteers where they will brief you through the interview progress. You will then be given 15 minutes to complete a form whereby you have to state specific examples of certain characteristics and traits (eg. Leadership, curiosity etc). On the same form you have to list down 3 questions you wanna ask the professors. Another 15 minutes will be given to you to design (sketch on a black paper) a Web page depending on the case study. Once completed, you will be led to another room where the interviewers will already be seated. One by one, you have to present your design to everybody. Do expect some questions to be asked by the professors pertaining to your design.  Next comes the famous SMU estimation question and you have 4 minutes to write down your answer on a piece of paper. The question I received was, "How many A4 sized papers are used for exam questions in SMU per semester." They do not care about your final answer but are more concern on your thought process.

Don't think it is not important because there are many people with the same GPA as you, so how do they consider applicants? To see if they have any additional talents/achievements they can bring with them outside their GPA!!! I cannot stress this enough, especially if you are from a poly! Also, I feel you about not being able to get into a local university of my choice! I screwed up my admission to get into my several dream courses at various Local U's during the first year because I thought they only look at GPA, and hence I didn't really bother much with the interview/and did not fill my non-CCA achievements. I thought I would definitely secure a place butI was so FRIGGIN WRONG. I felt like I was going to die literally because I couldn't get into a Local U. It was awful because I worked so friggin hard in poly D': Fortunately, I managed to pull myself together and manage to not screw up the second time and got into a local U with a course of my choice  So, DONT GIVE UP BRO. Now that you are closer to ORD, find some time to improve yourself, hunt down your poly lecturer to write you that testimonial letter for your university admission as they will really help. You are a merit holder, I am sure you have worked hard for it and paid attention during leessons. Your lecturers 会给你面子 if you are sincere and ask nicely!   If all else fails, there is always a local university route outside of NTU/NUS and it can be even better than the two.. but I can't say here.. later people will think I am biased towards certain university...

NUS cannot choose their specialisation as what they wish, CAP is still a consideration. So far the only subject I have trouble understanding the lecturer is stats, most prof are Singaporean and speak rather well. Also, I survive 80% of my modules without the textbooks, notes are generally sufficient. Lastly, I have more NUS friends regretting not coming NBS instead.

I think you shouldn't get too caught up with reputation right now, it is something that shouldn't take precedence over your interests and your desired career - mainly because it isn't as important as you think it is. I've a senior, an IP student from one of the top JCs who scored straight B's for his A levels did not get called for an interview for his 1st nor 2nd choice at SMU. Fella decided to go to SIM to pursue his studies in a similar field and is earning quite a lot working as a trader for a fund now.  There are a lot of ways you can monetize your degree - as long as you are doing what you want to do you will think of ways to do so. If you're going to do Jap studies but you're interested in Finance, then do take some finance mods if that is possible, join a finance CCA, take up CFA, participate in competitions, write a paper on Japan and show your employer that you are well versed with Jap culture and at the same time highly passionate (and active) in the finance side of things - you will be an amazing hire for a company looking to expand into / their operations in Japan.  It is important for us not to get caught up with the rankings. I cannot stress this enough - at the end of the day, it is who you are, what you've done and how you're working towards your goals that matter, not the reputation of your University.  Just to share: the decision for me was simple back then - I've sorted out my interests, understood what I needed to do... so I picked the one that's closest to where I live  And my parents are both members of KRGH so that made the choice even more obvious! Thanks for the great advice!  I am offered to do Linguistics in NTU, and it's a more attractive offer now especially since I am offered a scholarship there. The truth is, I love languages, and I'm obsessed with Japanese as well. Been learning the language since P5, over 9 years liao. Been exposed to the culture since I was born, so I am very influenced and in love with it. But still, I don't really see the point in doing Japanese Studies.  I am a Tourism/Business student in NP, so I have both business and hospitality backgrounds to fall upon. I am thinking of being a translator/interpreter, but doing Jap Studies would be pointless since I can't just concentrate on just one language. Being an Eng teacher in Japan would be nice as well, and that would require linguistics studies... The worst thing is, both degrees have one of the lowest starting salary among all the degrees, am now hesitating on whether to appeal to NBS instead... :/ cGPA: ard 3.82 O level: L1R5=4, L1R4=6",11.452849134531945

And what's with the BIZ anal flip class room thing. really makes me feel like flipping table instead. lol but nus biz is copying smu in some ways. even our profs are comparing.

Personal feeling, people who refuses to teach generally do not score very well hence they feel insecure. For any of the peeps here, whatever course you go to, ignore the bell curve and teach. Nothing aid learning better than teaching your peers.averagewee wrote:  so far i haven't memorize anything for biz leh.

Mod that i score A/ A+ hardly require much memorising since I get the concepts. Main point is that in Uni learn to understand and not memorise, non of the dean listers I see uses pure memory.

Congrats on being shortlisted for SMU SIS interview! First and foremost, you can find numerous blogs and forums with information about the interview. That aside, I've just went for the interview on 9th April and have just received an acceptance email today. So I will be actually telling you what to expect for the interview but it may differ. Firstly, it is a group interview which  consists of 2 interviewers (professors) and 6 interviewees including you. Upon arrival, you will be led to a room by current SIS student volunteers where they will brief you through the interview progress. You will then be given 15 minutes to complete a form whereby you have to state specific examples of certain characteristics and traits (eg. Leadership, curiosity etc). On the same form you have to list down 3 questions you wanna ask the professors. Another 15 minutes will be given to you to design (sketch on a black paper) a Web page depending on the case study. Once completed, you will be led to another room where the interviewers will already be seated. One by one, you have to present your design to everybody. Do expect some questions to be asked by the professors pertaining to your design.  Next comes the famous SMU estimation question and you have 4 minutes to write down your answer on a piece of paper. The question I received was, "How many A4 sized papers are used for exam questions in SMU per semester." They do not care about your final answer but are more concern on your thought process. So make realistic and sound assumptions before arriving to your final answer. The professors may ask the origin of your assumption. So make sure you know how to explain. Lastly, the interview will end of with a Q&A session whereby questions you have listed on earlier will be answered. Do not list down questions which can be easily found on SMU's website.  Be confident and show your passion towards IS while presenting your ideas. SMU SIS looks for students who are able to analyse problems fast with critical thinking skills.

Could it be the reason that i am serving ns now? I kinda at a loss about what to do. I dont really wanna go SIM with my gpa! No! In fact, NS should be an advantage especially if you get into command school! (That is also considered a non-accademic achievement) Other awards like best soldier may help too! NS is the best time to talk about your experiences and what made you decide (forgive me if I sound too drama or cliche) on going into that dream course! NTU/NUS/SMU requires students to write more about themselves for the courses they require to get into/why and there is a portion for non-accademic achievements. Remember to fill that up! Don't think it is not important because there are many people with the same GPA as you, so how do they consider applicants? To see if they have any additional talents/achievements they can bring with them outside their GPA!!! I cannot stress this enough, especially if you are from a poly! Also, I feel you about not being able to get into a local university of my choice! I screwed up my admission to get into my several dream courses at various Local U's during the first year because I thought they only look at GPA, and hence I didn't really bother much with the interview/and did not fill my non-CCA achievements. I thought I would definitely secure a place butI was so FRIGGIN WRONG. I felt like I was going to die literally because I couldn't get into a Local U. It was awful because I worked so friggin hard in poly D': Fortunately, I managed to pull myself together and manage to not screw up the second time and got into a local U with a course of my choice  So, DONT GIVE UP BRO. Now that you are closer to ORD, find some time to improve yourself, hunt down your poly lecturer to write you that testimonial letter for your university admission as they will really help. You are a merit holder, I am sure you have worked hard for it and paid attention during leessons. Your lecturers 会给你面子 if you are sincere and ask nicely!   If all else fails, there is always a local university route outside of NTU/NUS and it can be even better than the two.. but I can't say here.. later people will think I am biased towards certain university...

I think you shouldn't get too caught up with reputation right now, it is something that shouldn't take precedence over your interests and your desired career - mainly because it isn't as important as you think it is. I've a senior, an IP student from one of the top JCs who scored straight B's for his A levels did not get called for an interview for his 1st nor 2nd choice at SMU. Fella decided to go to SIM to pursue his studies in a similar field and is earning quite a lot working as a trader for a fund now.  There are a lot of ways you can monetize your degree - as long as you are doing what you want to do you will think of ways to do so. If you're going to do Jap studies but you're interested in Finance, then do take some finance mods if that is possible, join a finance CCA, take up CFA, participate in competitions, write a paper on Japan and show your employer that you are well versed with Jap culture and at the same time highly passionate (and active) in the finance side of things - you will be an amazing hire for a company looking to expand into / their operations in Japan.  It is important for us not to get caught up with the rankings. I cannot stress this enough - at the end of the day, it is who you are, what you've done and how you're working towards your goals that matter, not the reputation of your University.  Just to share: the decision for me was simple back then - I've sorted out my interests, understood what I needed to do... so I picked the one that's closest to where I live  And my parents are both members of KRGH so that made the choice even more obvious! Thanks for the great advice!  I am offered to do Linguistics in NTU, and it's a more attractive offer now especially since I am offered a scholarship there. The truth is, I love languages, and I'm obsessed with Japanese as well. Been learning the language since P5, over 9 years liao. Been exposed to the culture since I was born, so I am very influenced and in love with it. But still, I don't really see the point in doing Japanese Studies.  I am a Tourism/Business student in NP, so I have both business and hospitality backgrounds to fall upon. I am thinking of being a translator/interpreter, but doing Jap Studies would be pointless since I can't just concentrate on just one language. Being an Eng teacher in Japan would be nice as well, and that would require linguistics studies... The worst thing is, both degrees have one of the lowest starting salary among all the degrees, am now hesitating on whether to appeal to NBS instead... :/ cGPA: ard 3.82 O level: L1R5=4, L1R4=6",11.452849134531945

Cheeyarn, you may wish to take note of the above point^. This reason may prove to be true for some NTU courses.

I took amaths and economics during my secondary and poly time respectively. I also applied for nus fass for the previous 2 years, but they rejected me too which i dunno why.  Could it be the reason that i am serving ns now? I kinda at a loss about what to do. I dont really wanna go SIM with my gpa! No! In fact, NS should be an advantage especially if you get into command school! (That is also considered a non-accademic achievement) Other awards like best soldier may help too! NS is the best time to talk about your experiences and what made you decide (forgive me if I sound too drama or cliche) on going into that dream course! NTU/NUS/SMU requires students to write more about themselves for the courses they require to get into/why and there is a portion for non-accademic achievements. Remember to fill that up! Don't think it is not important because there are many people with the same GPA as you, so how do they consider applicants? To see if they have any additional talents/achievements they can bring with them outside their GPA!!! I cannot stress this enough, especially if you are from a poly! Also, I feel you about not being able to get into a local university of my choice! I screwed up my admission to get into my several dream courses at various Local U's during the first year because I thought they only look at GPA, and hence I didn't really bother much with the interview/and did not fill my non-CCA achievements. I thought I would definitely secure a place butI was so FRIGGIN WRONG. I felt like I was going to die literally because I couldn't get into a Local U. It was awful because I worked so friggin hard in poly D': Fortunately, I managed to pull myself together and manage to not screw up the second time and got into a local U with a course of my choice  So, DONT GIVE UP BRO. Now that you are closer to ORD, find some time to improve yourself, hunt down your poly lecturer to write you that testimonial letter for your university admission as they will really help. You are a merit holder, I am sure you have worked hard for it and paid attention during leessons. Your lecturers 会给你面子 if you are sincere and ask nicely!   If all else fails, there is always a local university route outside of NTU/NUS and it can be even better than the two.. but I can't say here.. later people will think I am biased towards certain university...  Just request for a PM if you want more info!",12.371458624851808

I took blaw before and I don't remember any streaming video whatsoever. Recorded lecture is made available only to aid students who miss / have doubt after the lectures. NUS cannot choose their specialisation as what they wish, CAP is still a consideration. So far the only subject I have trouble understanding the lecturer is stats, most prof are Singaporean and speak rather well. Also, I survive 80% of my modules without the textbooks, notes are generally sufficient. Lastly, I have more NUS friends regretting not coming NBS instead.

I think you shouldn't get too caught up with reputation right now, it is something that shouldn't take precedence over your interests and your desired career - mainly because it isn't as important as you think it is. I've a senior, an IP student from one of the top JCs who scored straight B's for his A levels did not get called for an interview for his 1st nor 2nd choice at SMU. Fella decided to go to SIM to pursue his studies in a similar field and is earning quite a lot working as a trader for a fund now.  There are a lot of ways you can monetize your degree - as long as you are doing what you want to do you will think of ways to do so. If you're going to do Jap studies but you're interested in Finance, then do take some finance mods if that is possible, join a finance CCA, take up CFA, participate in competitions, write a paper on Japan and show your employer that you are well versed with Jap culture and at the same time highly passionate (and active) in the finance side of things - you will be an amazing hire for a company looking to expand into / their operations in Japan.  It is important for us not to get caught up with the rankings. I cannot stress this enough - at the end of the day, it is who you are, what you've done and how you're working towards your goals that matter, not the reputation of your University.  Just to share: the decision for me was simple back then - I've sorted out my interests, understood what I needed to do... so I picked the one that's closest to where I live  And my parents are both members of KRGH so that made the choice even more obvious! Thanks for the great advice!  I am offered to do Linguistics in NTU, and it's a more attractive offer now especially since I am offered a scholarship there. The truth is, I love languages, and I'm obsessed with Japanese as well. Been learning the language since P5, over 9 years liao. Been exposed to the culture since I was born, so I am very influenced and in love with it. But still, I don't really see the point in doing Japanese Studies.  I am a Tourism/Business student in NP, so I have both business and hospitality backgrounds to fall upon. I am thinking of being a translator/interpreter, but doing Jap Studies would be pointless since I can't just concentrate on just one language. Being an Eng teacher in Japan would be nice as well, and that would require linguistics studies... The worst thing is, both degrees have one of the lowest starting salary among all the degrees, am now hesitating on whether to appeal to NBS instead... :/ cGPA: ard 3.82 O level: L1R5=4, L1R4=6",11.452849134531945

And what's with the BIZ anal flip class room thing. really makes me feel like flipping table instead. lol but nus biz is copying smu in some ways. even our profs are comparing. NUS biz is surely harder to score. NBS average bellcurve lies at around B+ while NUS biz lies around B.

Personal feeling, people who refuses to teach generally do not score very well hence they feel insecure. For any of the peeps here, whatever course you go to, ignore the bell curve and teach. Nothing aid learning better than teaching your peers.averagewee wrote:  so far i haven't memorize anything for biz leh.

Mod that i score A/ A+ hardly require much memorising since I get the concepts. Main point is that in Uni learn to understand and not memorise, non of the dean listers I see uses pure memory.

Firstly, it is a group interview which  consists of 2 interviewers (professors) and 6 interviewees including you. Upon arrival, you will be led to a room by current SIS student volunteers where they will brief you through the interview progress. You will then be given 15 minutes to complete a form whereby you have to state specific examples of certain characteristics and traits (eg. Leadership, curiosity etc). On the same form you have to list down 3 questions you wanna ask the professors. Another 15 minutes will be given to you to design (sketch on a black paper) a Web page depending on the case study. Once completed, you will be led to another room where the interviewers will already be seated. One by one, you have to present your design to everybody. Do expect some questions to be asked by the professors pertaining to your design.  Next comes the famous SMU estimation question and you have 4 minutes to write down your answer on a piece of paper. The question I received was, "How many A4 sized papers are used for exam questions in SMU per semester." They do not care about your final answer but are more concern on your thought process. So make realistic and sound assumptions before arriving to your final answer. The professors may ask the origin of your assumption. So make sure you know how to explain. Lastly, the interview will end of with a Q&A session whereby questions you have listed on earlier will be answered. Do not list down questions which can be easily found on SMU's website.

I am thinking of being a translator/interpreter, but doing Jap Studies would be pointless since I can't just concentrate on just one language.

I'm currently year one bba student. so many bell curve wreckers and the modules are so quantitative in nature. I remember last sem the mean and median for FA was 26 and 28. almost everybody got close to full marks and the exam was madness. And what's with the BIZ anal flip class room thing. really makes me feel like flipping table instead. lol but nus biz is copying smu in some ways. even our profs are comparing. NUS biz is surely harder to score. NBS average bellcurve lies at around B+ while NUS biz lies around B. Not to mention the accountancy cohort of NUS is 3 times smaller than NBS with people of much higher GPA/ Rank point going in.averagewee wrote:  eh not sure leh. for my sectional group we all like competitive in class but outside class like alright leh. So far nobody has ever throw my notes away leh. But i heard stories from senior that there are people who don't even teach their friends as they think it's damn stupid to help them due to the bellcurve. Personal feeling, people who refuses to teach generally do not score very well hence they feel insecure. For any of the peeps here, whatever course you go to, ignore the bell curve and teach. Nothing aid learning better than teaching your peers.averagewee wrote:  so far i haven't memorize anything for biz leh. Mostly got cheatsheet and biz cannot really memorize la. need quite a lot of critical thinking in some way. Biz in uni is quite different from poly in some way. Agreed, it works for NBS too. Not much memorization need with so many mod having open book and cheatsheet. Mods that i memorised generally only score a B+ or so because i fail to understand the concepts. Mod that i score A/ A+ hardly require much memorising since I get the concepts. Main point is that in Uni learn to understand and not memorise, non of the dean listers I see uses pure memory.

That aside, I've just went for the interview on 9th April and have just received an acceptance email today. So I will be actually telling you what to expect for the interview but it may differ. Firstly, it is a group interview which  consists of 2 interviewers (professors) and 6 interviewees including you. Upon arrival, you will be led to a room by current SIS student volunteers where they will brief you through the interview progress. You will then be given 15 minutes to complete a form whereby you have to state specific examples of certain characteristics and traits (eg. Leadership, curiosity etc). On the same form you have to list down 3 questions you wanna ask the professors. Another 15 minutes will be given to you to design (sketch on a black paper) a Web page depending on the case study. Once completed, you will be led to another room where the interviewers will already be seated. One by one, you have to present your design to everybody. Do expect some questions to be asked by the professors pertaining to your design.  Next comes the famous SMU estimation question and you have 4 minutes to write down your answer on a piece of paper. The question I received was, "How many A4 sized papers are used for exam questions in SMU per semester." They do not care about your final answer but are more concern on your thought process. So make realistic and sound assumptions before arriving to your final answer. The professors may ask the origin of your assumption. So make sure you know how to explain. Lastly, the interview will end of with a Q&A session whereby questions you have listed on earlier will be answered. Do not list down questions which can be easily found on SMU's website.  Be confident and show your passion towards IS while presenting your ideas. SMU SIS looks for students who are able to analyse problems fast with critical thinking skills.

I am thinking of being a translator/interpreter, but doing Jap Studies would be pointless since I can't just concentrate on just one language. Being an Eng teacher in Japan would be nice as well, and that would require linguistics studies... The worst thing is, both degrees have one of the lowest starting salary among all the degrees, am now hesitating on whether to appeal to NBS instead... :/ cGPA: ard 3.82 O level: L1R5=4, L1R4=6",11.452849134531945

Mod that i score A/ A+ hardly require much memorising since I get the concepts. Main point is that in Uni learn to understand and not memorise, non of the dean listers I see uses pure memory.

2015,Singapore Management University|smu,Republic Polytechnic|Republic poly|rp|computer|com|infosys|information systems|analytics,"How Singapore's six public universities differ Published in ST on 3 March 2015http://www.straitstimes.com/singapor...rsities-differ With six public universities, students now have a diverse range of degrees to choose from. To attract the best students, the universities are striving to be different - in their programmes, tuition fees, student and faculty mix, accommodation options, financial help and overseas opportunities. Calvin Yang looks at the options offered. FULL-TIME DEGREE PROGRAMMES National University of Singapore (NUS): It has more than 50 full-time degrees, with exclusive ones such as those in dentistry, music and pharmacy. Nanyang Technological University (NTU): It has more than 50 degrees, with niche programmes such as communication studies, and sport science and management. Singapore Management University (SMU): It offers seven full-time programmes such as accountancy, law, information systems management and an SUTD-SMU dual degree programme in technology and management, launched last year. Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD): Its five degrees include architecture and sustainable design, engineering product development, engineering systems and design, and information systems technology and design. Singapore Institute of Technology (SIT): Catering mainly to polytechnic graduates, the university has 36 programmes - some offered by reputable partner universities and others run solely by SIT. The programmes include culinary arts management, criminology and security, game design and naval architecture. SIM University (UniSIM): The university synonymous with part-time degrees recently started offering full-time programmes in accountancy, finance and marketing. It will introduce a fourth full-time degree in human resource management this year. TUITION FEES These are for Singaporean students admitted in the academic year 2014/2015, except for UniSIM undergraduates. NUS: Annual tuition fees range between $7,850 - for courses like computing, engineering, and arts and social sciences - and $24,200 for medicine and dentistry. NTU: Fees are between $7,850 for most programmes, and $31,500 for medical students. SMU: Undergraduates who started last August are paying $11,100 per year, except for law students, who are paying $12,300. SUTD: An education at the university costs $11,650 per year. SIT: Annual fees range from $10,100 to $15,300. UniSIM: This year's accountancy students will pay about $33,000 for the entire degree programme, while students from other programmes will pay about $31,000. FINANCIAL HELP NUS: It has a wide range of scholarships and financial aid available. Over the past five years, it has seen a two-fold increase in students receiving scholarships, from about 800 in 2009 to 1,650 in 2013. There was a 60 per cent increase in the number of students receiving bursaries over the same period. NTU: For the new academic year that starts in August, it will be providing about 500 full-term scholarships, namely the Nanyang Scholarship and College Scholarship. Singaporean students interested in taking up a bursary each will receive assistance as long as their household per capita income is $1,900 or less per month. SMU: It has a comprehensive range of financial schemes. For scholarships, about 60 per cent of those who apply have been successful in securing a scholarship supported by the university or its donors. SUTD: It offers 173 scholarships and 43 bursaries, excluding government ones. SIT: More than 10 per cent of students are on scholarships or sponsorships by their employers or prospective employers. UniSIM: About a dozen scholarships, such as the SIM University Scholarship, and bursaries, such as the Ministry of Education Bursary, are available to students. STUDENT RESIDENCES NUS: The six halls of residence, four student residences and five residential colleges offer about 11,000 places in all for full-time students. A one-week stay in a typical single, non-air-conditioned room costs between $110 and $130. NTU: Its 18 residential halls house more than 10,400 undergraduates. Rental fees range from $225 to $280 monthly for a twin-sharing room. SMU: It does not have any student residences for local students. SUTD: It has three student housing blocks with a capacity of around 1,100 beds. Depending on the room type, an undergraduate typically pays around $350 to $480 per month. SIT: It does not offer any student residences. UniSIM: It does not have any student accommodation. OVERSEAS EXPOSURE NUS: About 70 per cent of undergraduates have at least an overseas exposure stint, such as summer school or internships. NTU: Some 80 per cent of students get some form of overseas exposure, such as taking classes at a partner university overseas. SMU: About 86 per cent of students have some form of overseas exposure, mainly through student exchange programmes. SUTD: Nearly 60 per cent of undergraduates have overseas experience. SIT: All students taking programmes offered by its partner universities abroad must go for an Overseas Immersion Programme as part of the curriculum. They spend between three and 17 weeks at the home campus of the university. Also, nearly all undergraduates doing SIT's own programmes have gone on study trips and work-study initiatives overseas. UniSIM: Its full-time students must go for an overseas stint during their studies. Currently, they have not started their stints, which may include a work attachment programme or a service learning project.",12.062769948050786

Dean level are too high, they dont micro-manage down to the undergraduate admissions level. At most they do get involved in grad students admissions. Try appealing to an Assoc Prof or an Asst Prof.  2. I believe there is only one window of official appeal. Any appeals outside of the NTU system(ie. directly to the prof) would be counted as informal appeals. 4. Soci is essay and exam based.

We will only know in December when the new IGP for this year comes out when we can see how much the IGP has risen.  If your grades are good, I'd recommend that you try again next year. This time, apply strategically, put courses that are clearly in reach (safely above IGP) as your first choice. It looks like an RP of 72.5 just matches both SMU SS and NTU Soci. This is cutting it too close in my opinion. You'd want to apply for courses like English, History or Chinese where you are above the IGP.

To attract the best students, the universities are striving to be different - in their programmes, tuition fees, student and faculty mix, accommodation options, financial help and overseas opportunities. Calvin Yang looks at the options offered. FULL-TIME DEGREE PROGRAMMES National University of Singapore (NUS): It has more than 50 full-time degrees, with exclusive ones such as those in dentistry, music and pharmacy. Nanyang Technological University (NTU): It has more than 50 degrees, with niche programmes such as communication studies, and sport science and management. Singapore Management University (SMU): It offers seven full-time programmes such as accountancy, law, information systems management and an SUTD-SMU dual degree programme in technology and management, launched last year. Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD): Its five degrees include architecture and sustainable design, engineering product development, engineering systems and design, and information systems technology and design. Singapore Institute of Technology (SIT): Catering mainly to polytechnic graduates, the university has 36 programmes - some offered by reputable partner universities and others run solely by SIT. The programmes include culinary arts management, criminology and security, game design and naval architecture. SIM University (UniSIM): The university synonymous with part-time degrees recently started offering full-time programmes in accountancy, finance and marketing. It will introduce a fourth full-time degree in human resource management this year. TUITION FEES These are for Singaporean students admitted in the academic year 2014/2015, except for UniSIM undergraduates. NUS: Annual tuition fees range between $7,850 - for courses like computing, engineering, and arts and social sciences - and $24,200 for medicine and dentistry. NTU: Fees are between $7,850 for most programmes, and $31,500 for medical students. SMU: Undergraduates who started last August are paying $11,100 per year, except for law students, who are paying $12,300. SUTD: An education at the university costs $11,650 per year. SIT: Annual fees range from $10,100 to $15,300. UniSIM: This year's accountancy students will pay about $33,000 for the entire degree programme, while students from other programmes will pay about $31,000. FINANCIAL HELP NUS: It has a wide range of scholarships and financial aid available. Over the past five years, it has seen a two-fold increase in students receiving scholarships, from about 800 in 2009 to 1,650 in 2013. There was a 60 per cent increase in the number of students receiving bursaries over the same period. NTU: For the new academic year that starts in August, it will be providing about 500 full-term scholarships, namely the Nanyang Scholarship and College Scholarship. Singaporean students interested in taking up a bursary each will receive assistance as long as their household per capita income is $1,900 or less per month. SMU: It has a comprehensive range of financial schemes. For scholarships, about 60 per cent of those who apply have been successful in securing a scholarship supported by the university or its donors. SUTD: It offers 173 scholarships and 43 bursaries, excluding government ones. SIT: More than 10 per cent of students are on scholarships or sponsorships by their employers or prospective employers. UniSIM: About a dozen scholarships, such as the SIM University Scholarship, and bursaries, such as the Ministry of Education Bursary, are available to students. STUDENT RESIDENCES NUS: The six halls of residence, four student residences and five residential colleges offer about 11,000 places in all for full-time students. A one-week stay in a typical single, non-air-conditioned room costs between $110 and $130. NTU: Its 18 residential halls house more than 10,400 undergraduates. Rental fees range from $225 to $280 monthly for a twin-sharing room. SMU: It does not have any student residences for local students. SUTD: It has three student housing blocks with a capacity of around 1,100 beds. Depending on the room type, an undergraduate typically pays around $350 to $480 per month. SIT: It does not offer any student residences. UniSIM: It does not have any student accommodation. OVERSEAS EXPOSURE NUS: About 70 per cent of undergraduates have at least an overseas exposure stint, such as summer school or internships. NTU: Some 80 per cent of students get some form of overseas exposure, such as taking classes at a partner university overseas. SMU: About 86 per cent of students have some form of overseas exposure, mainly through student exchange programmes. SUTD: Nearly 60 per cent of undergraduates have overseas experience. SIT: All students taking programmes offered by its partner universities abroad must go for an Overseas Immersion Programme as part of the curriculum. They spend between three and 17 weeks at the home campus of the university. Also, nearly all undergraduates doing SIT's own programmes have gone on study trips and work-study initiatives overseas. UniSIM: Its full-time students must go for an overseas stint during their studies. Currently, they have not started their stints, which may include a work attachment programme or a service learning project.",12.072184331938397

What kind of assignments do they have and the mode of testings? Thank you guys1. Dont appeal to the Deans directly. Dean level are too high, they dont micro-manage down to the undergraduate admissions level. At most they do get involved in grad students admissions. Try appealing to an Assoc Prof or an Asst Prof.  2. I believe there is only one window of official appeal. Any appeals outside of the NTU system(ie. directly to the prof) would be counted as informal appeals. 4. Soci is essay and exam based. There is always a compulsory module in your first semester that will teach you how to craft uni-level essays.",10.315457708129243

Humanities is always getting more popular here while STEM courses are getting less popular. We will only know in December when the new IGP for this year comes out when we can see how much the IGP has risen.  If your grades are good, I'd recommend that you try again next year. This time, apply strategically, put courses that are clearly in reach (safely above IGP) as your first choice. It looks like an RP of 72.5 just matches both SMU SS and NTU Soci. This is cutting it too close in my opinion. You'd want to apply for courses like English, History or Chinese where you are above the IGP.

Dean level are too high, they dont micro-manage down to the undergraduate admissions level. At most they do get involved in grad students admissions. Try appealing to an Assoc Prof or an Asst Prof.  2. I believe there is only one window of official appeal. Any appeals outside of the NTU system(ie. directly to the prof) would be counted as informal appeals. 4. Soci is essay and exam based. There is always a compulsory module in your first semester that will teach you how to craft uni-level essays.",10.290644431286642

2015,Singapore Management University|smu,temasek polytechnic|temasek poly|tp|computer|com|infosys|information systems|analytics,"How Singapore's six public universities differ Published in ST on 3 March 2015http://www.straitstimes.com/singapor...rsities-differ With six public universities, students now have a diverse range of degrees to choose from. To attract the best students, the universities are striving to be different - in their programmes, tuition fees, student and faculty mix, accommodation options, financial help and overseas opportunities. Calvin Yang looks at the options offered. FULL-TIME DEGREE PROGRAMMES National University of Singapore (NUS): It has more than 50 full-time degrees, with exclusive ones such as those in dentistry, music and pharmacy. Nanyang Technological University (NTU): It has more than 50 degrees, with niche programmes such as communication studies, and sport science and management. Singapore Management University (SMU): It offers seven full-time programmes such as accountancy, law, information systems management and an SUTD-SMU dual degree programme in technology and management, launched last year. Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD): Its five degrees include architecture and sustainable design, engineering product development, engineering systems and design, and information systems technology and design. Singapore Institute of Technology (SIT): Catering mainly to polytechnic graduates, the university has 36 programmes - some offered by reputable partner universities and others run solely by SIT. The programmes include culinary arts management, criminology and security, game design and naval architecture. SIM University (UniSIM): The university synonymous with part-time degrees recently started offering full-time programmes in accountancy, finance and marketing. It will introduce a fourth full-time degree in human resource management this year. TUITION FEES These are for Singaporean students admitted in the academic year 2014/2015, except for UniSIM undergraduates. NUS: Annual tuition fees range between $7,850 - for courses like computing, engineering, and arts and social sciences - and $24,200 for medicine and dentistry. NTU: Fees are between $7,850 for most programmes, and $31,500 for medical students. SMU: Undergraduates who started last August are paying $11,100 per year, except for law students, who are paying $12,300. SUTD: An education at the university costs $11,650 per year. SIT: Annual fees range from $10,100 to $15,300. UniSIM: This year's accountancy students will pay about $33,000 for the entire degree programme, while students from other programmes will pay about $31,000. FINANCIAL HELP NUS: It has a wide range of scholarships and financial aid available. Over the past five years, it has seen a two-fold increase in students receiving scholarships, from about 800 in 2009 to 1,650 in 2013. There was a 60 per cent increase in the number of students receiving bursaries over the same period. NTU: For the new academic year that starts in August, it will be providing about 500 full-term scholarships, namely the Nanyang Scholarship and College Scholarship. Singaporean students interested in taking up a bursary each will receive assistance as long as their household per capita income is $1,900 or less per month. SMU: It has a comprehensive range of financial schemes. For scholarships, about 60 per cent of those who apply have been successful in securing a scholarship supported by the university or its donors. SUTD: It offers 173 scholarships and 43 bursaries, excluding government ones. SIT: More than 10 per cent of students are on scholarships or sponsorships by their employers or prospective employers. UniSIM: About a dozen scholarships, such as the SIM University Scholarship, and bursaries, such as the Ministry of Education Bursary, are available to students. STUDENT RESIDENCES NUS: The six halls of residence, four student residences and five residential colleges offer about 11,000 places in all for full-time students. A one-week stay in a typical single, non-air-conditioned room costs between $110 and $130. NTU: Its 18 residential halls house more than 10,400 undergraduates. Rental fees range from $225 to $280 monthly for a twin-sharing room. SMU: It does not have any student residences for local students. SUTD: It has three student housing blocks with a capacity of around 1,100 beds. Depending on the room type, an undergraduate typically pays around $350 to $480 per month. SIT: It does not offer any student residences. UniSIM: It does not have any student accommodation. OVERSEAS EXPOSURE NUS: About 70 per cent of undergraduates have at least an overseas exposure stint, such as summer school or internships. NTU: Some 80 per cent of students get some form of overseas exposure, such as taking classes at a partner university overseas. SMU: About 86 per cent of students have some form of overseas exposure, mainly through student exchange programmes. SUTD: Nearly 60 per cent of undergraduates have overseas experience. SIT: All students taking programmes offered by its partner universities abroad must go for an Overseas Immersion Programme as part of the curriculum. They spend between three and 17 weeks at the home campus of the university. Also, nearly all undergraduates doing SIT's own programmes have gone on study trips and work-study initiatives overseas. UniSIM: Its full-time students must go for an overseas stint during their studies. Currently, they have not started their stints, which may include a work attachment programme or a service learning project.",12.074099021822173

I'm quite sure about the Accountancy part of my degree, but am not sure if I should do a Single Degree in Accountancy or a DDP (for NTU/SMU, btw, since I understand that NUS offers a BBA (Acc) instead). Certainly the Single Degree saves about 0.5-1 year, but the opportunity cost of that doesn't seem that significant to me, especially if I can gain some extra expertise. I'm quite sure that I can cope with the workload also.  Would an extra Business degree offer significantly more flexibility? Right now, I'm thinking of becoming a forensic accountant, but of course that may change and I'd like to keep my options open -- maybe I'll go into banking/management-type jobs if I find them interesting. Does anyone have any insight about which type of degree I should choose? ",8.214314147632097
2015,Singapore Management University|smu,nanyang polytechnic|nanyang poly|nyp|computer|com|infosys|information systems|analytics,"How Singapore's six public universities differ Published in ST on 3 March 2015http://www.straitstimes.com/singapor...rsities-differ With six public universities, students now have a diverse range of degrees to choose from. To attract the best students, the universities are striving to be different - in their programmes, tuition fees, student and faculty mix, accommodation options, financial help and overseas opportunities. Calvin Yang looks at the options offered. FULL-TIME DEGREE PROGRAMMES National University of Singapore (NUS): It has more than 50 full-time degrees, with exclusive ones such as those in dentistry, music and pharmacy. Nanyang Technological University (NTU): It has more than 50 degrees, with niche programmes such as communication studies, and sport science and management. Singapore Management University (SMU): It offers seven full-time programmes such as accountancy, law, information systems management and an SUTD-SMU dual degree programme in technology and management, launched last year. Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD): Its five degrees include architecture and sustainable design, engineering product development, engineering systems and design, and information systems technology and design. Singapore Institute of Technology (SIT): Catering mainly to polytechnic graduates, the university has 36 programmes - some offered by reputable partner universities and others run solely by SIT. The programmes include culinary arts management, criminology and security, game design and naval architecture. SIM University (UniSIM): The university synonymous with part-time degrees recently started offering full-time programmes in accountancy, finance and marketing. It will introduce a fourth full-time degree in human resource management this year. TUITION FEES These are for Singaporean students admitted in the academic year 2014/2015, except for UniSIM undergraduates. NUS: Annual tuition fees range between $7,850 - for courses like computing, engineering, and arts and social sciences - and $24,200 for medicine and dentistry. NTU: Fees are between $7,850 for most programmes, and $31,500 for medical students. SMU: Undergraduates who started last August are paying $11,100 per year, except for law students, who are paying $12,300. SUTD: An education at the university costs $11,650 per year. SIT: Annual fees range from $10,100 to $15,300. UniSIM: This year's accountancy students will pay about $33,000 for the entire degree programme, while students from other programmes will pay about $31,000. FINANCIAL HELP NUS: It has a wide range of scholarships and financial aid available. Over the past five years, it has seen a two-fold increase in students receiving scholarships, from about 800 in 2009 to 1,650 in 2013. There was a 60 per cent increase in the number of students receiving bursaries over the same period. NTU: For the new academic year that starts in August, it will be providing about 500 full-term scholarships, namely the Nanyang Scholarship and College Scholarship. Singaporean students interested in taking up a bursary each will receive assistance as long as their household per capita income is $1,900 or less per month. SMU: It has a comprehensive range of financial schemes. For scholarships, about 60 per cent of those who apply have been successful in securing a scholarship supported by the university or its donors. SUTD: It offers 173 scholarships and 43 bursaries, excluding government ones. SIT: More than 10 per cent of students are on scholarships or sponsorships by their employers or prospective employers. UniSIM: About a dozen scholarships, such as the SIM University Scholarship, and bursaries, such as the Ministry of Education Bursary, are available to students. STUDENT RESIDENCES NUS: The six halls of residence, four student residences and five residential colleges offer about 11,000 places in all for full-time students. A one-week stay in a typical single, non-air-conditioned room costs between $110 and $130. NTU: Its 18 residential halls house more than 10,400 undergraduates. Rental fees range from $225 to $280 monthly for a twin-sharing room. SMU: It does not have any student residences for local students. SUTD: It has three student housing blocks with a capacity of around 1,100 beds. Depending on the room type, an undergraduate typically pays around $350 to $480 per month. SIT: It does not offer any student residences. UniSIM: It does not have any student accommodation. OVERSEAS EXPOSURE NUS: About 70 per cent of undergraduates have at least an overseas exposure stint, such as summer school or internships. NTU: Some 80 per cent of students get some form of overseas exposure, such as taking classes at a partner university overseas. SMU: About 86 per cent of students have some form of overseas exposure, mainly through student exchange programmes. SUTD: Nearly 60 per cent of undergraduates have overseas experience. SIT: All students taking programmes offered by its partner universities abroad must go for an Overseas Immersion Programme as part of the curriculum. They spend between three and 17 weeks at the home campus of the university. Also, nearly all undergraduates doing SIT's own programmes have gone on study trips and work-study initiatives overseas. UniSIM: Its full-time students must go for an overseas stint during their studies. Currently, they have not started their stints, which may include a work attachment programme or a service learning project.",12.074777469778098

Try appealing to an Assoc Prof or an Asst Prof.  2. I believe there is only one window of official appeal.

This piece of news is a huge personal blow to me but I decided to share it here despite personal pain because I had benefited from the advice of forumers here (and some who took the time and effort to reply me through PM) and I hope that in turn, through my sharing, it can possibly help another person gain a more complete insight into the uni's application process.   That said, I'm pretty devastated. I think the most infuriating part is not knowing what I had done wrong to be rejected. My GPA sits well within the IGP range and I personally know of people who had a lower GPA than mine but successfully secured a place in Sociology. I can only deduce that my poor O levels spoiled the chances for me. BUT whether it is truly because of this reason, I cannot be really sure - and this is the frustrating part.  What do they use to calculate the O levels component? Is it L1R5 or L1B4?    What should I do now? Can any seniors advise me please?

To attract the best students, the universities are striving to be different - in their programmes, tuition fees, student and faculty mix, accommodation options, financial help and overseas opportunities. Calvin Yang looks at the options offered. FULL-TIME DEGREE PROGRAMMES National University of Singapore (NUS): It has more than 50 full-time degrees, with exclusive ones such as those in dentistry, music and pharmacy. Nanyang Technological University (NTU): It has more than 50 degrees, with niche programmes such as communication studies, and sport science and management. Singapore Management University (SMU): It offers seven full-time programmes such as accountancy, law, information systems management and an SUTD-SMU dual degree programme in technology and management, launched last year. Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD): Its five degrees include architecture and sustainable design, engineering product development, engineering systems and design, and information systems technology and design. Singapore Institute of Technology (SIT): Catering mainly to polytechnic graduates, the university has 36 programmes - some offered by reputable partner universities and others run solely by SIT. The programmes include culinary arts management, criminology and security, game design and naval architecture. SIM University (UniSIM): The university synonymous with part-time degrees recently started offering full-time programmes in accountancy, finance and marketing. It will introduce a fourth full-time degree in human resource management this year. TUITION FEES These are for Singaporean students admitted in the academic year 2014/2015, except for UniSIM undergraduates. NUS: Annual tuition fees range between $7,850 - for courses like computing, engineering, and arts and social sciences - and $24,200 for medicine and dentistry. NTU: Fees are between $7,850 for most programmes, and $31,500 for medical students. SMU: Undergraduates who started last August are paying $11,100 per year, except for law students, who are paying $12,300. SUTD: An education at the university costs $11,650 per year. SIT: Annual fees range from $10,100 to $15,300. UniSIM: This year's accountancy students will pay about $33,000 for the entire degree programme, while students from other programmes will pay about $31,000. FINANCIAL HELP NUS: It has a wide range of scholarships and financial aid available. Over the past five years, it has seen a two-fold increase in students receiving scholarships, from about 800 in 2009 to 1,650 in 2013. There was a 60 per cent increase in the number of students receiving bursaries over the same period. NTU: For the new academic year that starts in August, it will be providing about 500 full-term scholarships, namely the Nanyang Scholarship and College Scholarship. Singaporean students interested in taking up a bursary each will receive assistance as long as their household per capita income is $1,900 or less per month. SMU: It has a comprehensive range of financial schemes. For scholarships, about 60 per cent of those who apply have been successful in securing a scholarship supported by the university or its donors. SUTD: It offers 173 scholarships and 43 bursaries, excluding government ones. SIT: More than 10 per cent of students are on scholarships or sponsorships by their employers or prospective employers. UniSIM: About a dozen scholarships, such as the SIM University Scholarship, and bursaries, such as the Ministry of Education Bursary, are available to students. STUDENT RESIDENCES NUS: The six halls of residence, four student residences and five residential colleges offer about 11,000 places in all for full-time students. A one-week stay in a typical single, non-air-conditioned room costs between $110 and $130. NTU: Its 18 residential halls house more than 10,400 undergraduates. Rental fees range from $225 to $280 monthly for a twin-sharing room. SMU: It does not have any student residences for local students. SUTD: It has three student housing blocks with a capacity of around 1,100 beds. Depending on the room type, an undergraduate typically pays around $350 to $480 per month. SIT: It does not offer any student residences. UniSIM: It does not have any student accommodation. OVERSEAS EXPOSURE NUS: About 70 per cent of undergraduates have at least an overseas exposure stint, such as summer school or internships. NTU: Some 80 per cent of students get some form of overseas exposure, such as taking classes at a partner university overseas. SMU: About 86 per cent of students have some form of overseas exposure, mainly through student exchange programmes. SUTD: Nearly 60 per cent of undergraduates have overseas experience. SIT: All students taking programmes offered by its partner universities abroad must go for an Overseas Immersion Programme as part of the curriculum. They spend between three and 17 weeks at the home campus of the university. Also, nearly all undergraduates doing SIT's own programmes have gone on study trips and work-study initiatives overseas. UniSIM: Its full-time students must go for an overseas stint during their studies. Currently, they have not started their stints, which may include a work attachment programme or a service learning project.",12.08536779228011

Dean level are too high, they dont micro-manage down to the undergraduate admissions level. At most they do get involved in grad students admissions. Try appealing to an Assoc Prof or an Asst Prof.  2. I believe there is only one window of official appeal. Any appeals outside of the NTU system(ie. directly to the prof) would be counted as informal appeals. 4. Soci is essay and exam based. There is always a compulsory module in your first semester that will teach you how to craft uni-level essays.",10.234035852114781

This time, apply strategically, put courses that are clearly in reach (safely above IGP) as your first choice. It looks like an RP of 72.5 just matches both SMU SS and NTU Soci.

Try appealing to an Assoc Prof or an Asst Prof.  2. I believe there is only one window of official appeal.

To attract the best students, the universities are striving to be different - in their programmes, tuition fees, student and faculty mix, accommodation options, financial help and overseas opportunities. Calvin Yang looks at the options offered. FULL-TIME DEGREE PROGRAMMES National University of Singapore (NUS): It has more than 50 full-time degrees, with exclusive ones such as those in dentistry, music and pharmacy. Nanyang Technological University (NTU): It has more than 50 degrees, with niche programmes such as communication studies, and sport science and management. Singapore Management University (SMU): It offers seven full-time programmes such as accountancy, law, information systems management and an SUTD-SMU dual degree programme in technology and management, launched last year. Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD): Its five degrees include architecture and sustainable design, engineering product development, engineering systems and design, and information systems technology and design. Singapore Institute of Technology (SIT): Catering mainly to polytechnic graduates, the university has 36 programmes - some offered by reputable partner universities and others run solely by SIT. The programmes include culinary arts management, criminology and security, game design and naval architecture. SIM University (UniSIM): The university synonymous with part-time degrees recently started offering full-time programmes in accountancy, finance and marketing. It will introduce a fourth full-time degree in human resource management this year. TUITION FEES These are for Singaporean students admitted in the academic year 2014/2015, except for UniSIM undergraduates. NUS: Annual tuition fees range between $7,850 - for courses like computing, engineering, and arts and social sciences - and $24,200 for medicine and dentistry. NTU: Fees are between $7,850 for most programmes, and $31,500 for medical students. SMU: Undergraduates who started last August are paying $11,100 per year, except for law students, who are paying $12,300. SUTD: An education at the university costs $11,650 per year. SIT: Annual fees range from $10,100 to $15,300. UniSIM: This year's accountancy students will pay about $33,000 for the entire degree programme, while students from other programmes will pay about $31,000. FINANCIAL HELP NUS: It has a wide range of scholarships and financial aid available. Over the past five years, it has seen a two-fold increase in students receiving scholarships, from about 800 in 2009 to 1,650 in 2013.

To attract the best students, the universities are striving to be different - in their programmes, tuition fees, student and faculty mix, accommodation options, financial help and overseas opportunities. Calvin Yang looks at the options offered. FULL-TIME DEGREE PROGRAMMES National University of Singapore (NUS): It has more than 50 full-time degrees, with exclusive ones such as those in dentistry, music and pharmacy. Nanyang Technological University (NTU): It has more than 50 degrees, with niche programmes such as communication studies, and sport science and management. Singapore Management University (SMU): It offers seven full-time programmes such as accountancy, law, information systems management and an SUTD-SMU dual degree programme in technology and management, launched last year. Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD): Its five degrees include architecture and sustainable design, engineering product development, engineering systems and design, and information systems technology and design. Singapore Institute of Technology (SIT): Catering mainly to polytechnic graduates, the university has 36 programmes - some offered by reputable partner universities and others run solely by SIT. The programmes include culinary arts management, criminology and security, game design and naval architecture. SIM University (UniSIM): The university synonymous with part-time degrees recently started offering full-time programmes in accountancy, finance and marketing. It will introduce a fourth full-time degree in human resource management this year. TUITION FEES These are for Singaporean students admitted in the academic year 2014/2015, except for UniSIM undergraduates. NUS: Annual tuition fees range between $7,850 - for courses like computing, engineering, and arts and social sciences - and $24,200 for medicine and dentistry. NTU: Fees are between $7,850 for most programmes, and $31,500 for medical students. SMU: Undergraduates who started last August are paying $11,100 per year, except for law students, who are paying $12,300. SUTD: An education at the university costs $11,650 per year. SIT: Annual fees range from $10,100 to $15,300. UniSIM: This year's accountancy students will pay about $33,000 for the entire degree programme, while students from other programmes will pay about $31,000. FINANCIAL HELP NUS: It has a wide range of scholarships and financial aid available. Over the past five years, it has seen a two-fold increase in students receiving scholarships, from about 800 in 2009 to 1,650 in 2013. There was a 60 per cent increase in the number of students receiving bursaries over the same period. NTU: For the new academic year that starts in August, it will be providing about 500 full-term scholarships, namely the Nanyang Scholarship and College Scholarship. Singaporean students interested in taking up a bursary each will receive assistance as long as their household per capita income is $1,900 or less per month. SMU: It has a comprehensive range of financial schemes. For scholarships, about 60 per cent of those who apply have been successful in securing a scholarship supported by the university or its donors. SUTD: It offers 173 scholarships and 43 bursaries, excluding government ones. SIT: More than 10 per cent of students are on scholarships or sponsorships by their employers or prospective employers. UniSIM: About a dozen scholarships, such as the SIM University Scholarship, and bursaries, such as the Ministry of Education Bursary, are available to students. STUDENT RESIDENCES NUS: The six halls of residence, four student residences and five residential colleges offer about 11,000 places in all for full-time students. A one-week stay in a typical single, non-air-conditioned room costs between $110 and $130. NTU: Its 18 residential halls house more than 10,400 undergraduates. Rental fees range from $225 to $280 monthly for a twin-sharing room. SMU: It does not have any student residences for local students. SUTD: It has three student housing blocks with a capacity of around 1,100 beds. Depending on the room type, an undergraduate typically pays around $350 to $480 per month. SIT: It does not offer any student residences. UniSIM: It does not have any student accommodation. OVERSEAS EXPOSURE NUS: About 70 per cent of undergraduates have at least an overseas exposure stint, such as summer school or internships. NTU: Some 80 per cent of students get some form of overseas exposure, such as taking classes at a partner university overseas. SMU: About 86 per cent of students have some form of overseas exposure, mainly through student exchange programmes. SUTD: Nearly 60 per cent of undergraduates have overseas experience. SIT: All students taking programmes offered by its partner universities abroad must go for an Overseas Immersion Programme as part of the curriculum. They spend between three and 17 weeks at the home campus of the university. Also, nearly all undergraduates doing SIT's own programmes have gone on study trips and work-study initiatives overseas. UniSIM: Its full-time students must go for an overseas stint during their studies. Currently, they have not started their stints, which may include a work attachment programme or a service learning project.",12.08536779228011

Hmmm. Then I'm pretty much as lost as you. haha. The only reason would be that there are better scorers this year applying for the courses you applied for. Humanities is always getting more popular here while STEM courses are getting less popular. We will only know in December when the new IGP for this year comes out when we can see how much the IGP has risen.  If your grades are good, I'd recommend that you try again next year. This time, apply strategically, put courses that are clearly in reach (safely above IGP) as your first choice. It looks like an RP of 72.5 just matches both SMU SS and NTU Soci. This is cutting it too close in my opinion. You'd want to apply for courses like English, History or Chinese where you are above the IGP. In the meantime, work/intern or volunteer at some organisations first. Or even retake your A-levels to get a better grade set if you're confident.",9.454560038675353

That said, I'm pretty devastated. I think the most infuriating part is not knowing what I had done wrong to be rejected. My GPA sits well within the IGP range and I personally know of people who had a lower GPA than mine but successfully secured a place in Sociology. I can only deduce that my poor O levels spoiled the chances for me. BUT whether it is truly because of this reason, I cannot be really sure - and this is the frustrating part.  What do they use to calculate the O levels component? Is it L1R5 or L1B4?    What should I do now? Can any seniors advise me please?

2015,Singapore Management University|smu,Innova Junior College|innova jc|ijc|computer|com|infosys|information systems|analytics,"How Singapore's six public universities differ Published in ST on 3 March 2015http://www.straitstimes.com/singapor...rsities-differ With six public universities, students now have a diverse range of degrees to choose from. To attract the best students, the universities are striving to be different - in their programmes, tuition fees, student and faculty mix, accommodation options, financial help and overseas opportunities. Calvin Yang looks at the options offered. FULL-TIME DEGREE PROGRAMMES National University of Singapore (NUS): It has more than 50 full-time degrees, with exclusive ones such as those in dentistry, music and pharmacy. Nanyang Technological University (NTU): It has more than 50 degrees, with niche programmes such as communication studies, and sport science and management. Singapore Management University (SMU): It offers seven full-time programmes such as accountancy, law, information systems management and an SUTD-SMU dual degree programme in technology and management, launched last year. Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD): Its five degrees include architecture and sustainable design, engineering product development, engineering systems and design, and information systems technology and design. Singapore Institute of Technology (SIT): Catering mainly to polytechnic graduates, the university has 36 programmes - some offered by reputable partner universities and others run solely by SIT. The programmes include culinary arts management, criminology and security, game design and naval architecture. SIM University (UniSIM): The university synonymous with part-time degrees recently started offering full-time programmes in accountancy, finance and marketing. It will introduce a fourth full-time degree in human resource management this year. TUITION FEES These are for Singaporean students admitted in the academic year 2014/2015, except for UniSIM undergraduates. NUS: Annual tuition fees range between $7,850 - for courses like computing, engineering, and arts and social sciences - and $24,200 for medicine and dentistry. NTU: Fees are between $7,850 for most programmes, and $31,500 for medical students. SMU: Undergraduates who started last August are paying $11,100 per year, except for law students, who are paying $12,300. SUTD: An education at the university costs $11,650 per year. SIT: Annual fees range from $10,100 to $15,300. UniSIM: This year's accountancy students will pay about $33,000 for the entire degree programme, while students from other programmes will pay about $31,000. FINANCIAL HELP NUS: It has a wide range of scholarships and financial aid available. Over the past five years, it has seen a two-fold increase in students receiving scholarships, from about 800 in 2009 to 1,650 in 2013. There was a 60 per cent increase in the number of students receiving bursaries over the same period. NTU: For the new academic year that starts in August, it will be providing about 500 full-term scholarships, namely the Nanyang Scholarship and College Scholarship. Singaporean students interested in taking up a bursary each will receive assistance as long as their household per capita income is $1,900 or less per month. SMU: It has a comprehensive range of financial schemes. For scholarships, about 60 per cent of those who apply have been successful in securing a scholarship supported by the university or its donors. SUTD: It offers 173 scholarships and 43 bursaries, excluding government ones. SIT: More than 10 per cent of students are on scholarships or sponsorships by their employers or prospective employers. UniSIM: About a dozen scholarships, such as the SIM University Scholarship, and bursaries, such as the Ministry of Education Bursary, are available to students. STUDENT RESIDENCES NUS: The six halls of residence, four student residences and five residential colleges offer about 11,000 places in all for full-time students. A one-week stay in a typical single, non-air-conditioned room costs between $110 and $130. NTU: Its 18 residential halls house more than 10,400 undergraduates. Rental fees range from $225 to $280 monthly for a twin-sharing room. SMU: It does not have any student residences for local students. SUTD: It has three student housing blocks with a capacity of around 1,100 beds. Depending on the room type, an undergraduate typically pays around $350 to $480 per month. SIT: It does not offer any student residences. UniSIM: It does not have any student accommodation. OVERSEAS EXPOSURE NUS: About 70 per cent of undergraduates have at least an overseas exposure stint, such as summer school or internships. NTU: Some 80 per cent of students get some form of overseas exposure, such as taking classes at a partner university overseas. SMU: About 86 per cent of students have some form of overseas exposure, mainly through student exchange programmes. SUTD: Nearly 60 per cent of undergraduates have overseas experience. SIT: All students taking programmes offered by its partner universities abroad must go for an Overseas Immersion Programme as part of the curriculum. They spend between three and 17 weeks at the home campus of the university. Also, nearly all undergraduates doing SIT's own programmes have gone on study trips and work-study initiatives overseas. UniSIM: Its full-time students must go for an overseas stint during their studies. Currently, they have not started their stints, which may include a work attachment programme or a service learning project.",12.08536779228011

Dean level are too high, they dont micro-manage down to the undergraduate admissions level. At most they do get involved in grad students admissions. Try appealing to an Assoc Prof or an Asst Prof.  2. I believe there is only one window of official appeal. Any appeals outside of the NTU system(ie. directly to the prof) would be counted as informal appeals. 4. Soci is essay and exam based.

To attract the best students, the universities are striving to be different - in their programmes, tuition fees, student and faculty mix, accommodation options, financial help and overseas opportunities. Calvin Yang looks at the options offered. FULL-TIME DEGREE PROGRAMMES National University of Singapore (NUS): It has more than 50 full-time degrees, with exclusive ones such as those in dentistry, music and pharmacy. Nanyang Technological University (NTU): It has more than 50 degrees, with niche programmes such as communication studies, and sport science and management. Singapore Management University (SMU): It offers seven full-time programmes such as accountancy, law, information systems management and an SUTD-SMU dual degree programme in technology and management, launched last year. Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD): Its five degrees include architecture and sustainable design, engineering product development, engineering systems and design, and information systems technology and design. Singapore Institute of Technology (SIT): Catering mainly to polytechnic graduates, the university has 36 programmes - some offered by reputable partner universities and others run solely by SIT. The programmes include culinary arts management, criminology and security, game design and naval architecture. SIM University (UniSIM): The university synonymous with part-time degrees recently started offering full-time programmes in accountancy, finance and marketing. It will introduce a fourth full-time degree in human resource management this year. TUITION FEES These are for Singaporean students admitted in the academic year 2014/2015, except for UniSIM undergraduates. NUS: Annual tuition fees range between $7,850 - for courses like computing, engineering, and arts and social sciences - and $24,200 for medicine and dentistry. NTU: Fees are between $7,850 for most programmes, and $31,500 for medical students. SMU: Undergraduates who started last August are paying $11,100 per year, except for law students, who are paying $12,300. SUTD: An education at the university costs $11,650 per year. SIT: Annual fees range from $10,100 to $15,300. UniSIM: This year's accountancy students will pay about $33,000 for the entire degree programme, while students from other programmes will pay about $31,000. FINANCIAL HELP NUS: It has a wide range of scholarships and financial aid available. Over the past five years, it has seen a two-fold increase in students receiving scholarships, from about 800 in 2009 to 1,650 in 2013. There was a 60 per cent increase in the number of students receiving bursaries over the same period. NTU: For the new academic year that starts in August, it will be providing about 500 full-term scholarships, namely the Nanyang Scholarship and College Scholarship. Singaporean students interested in taking up a bursary each will receive assistance as long as their household per capita income is $1,900 or less per month. SMU: It has a comprehensive range of financial schemes. For scholarships, about 60 per cent of those who apply have been successful in securing a scholarship supported by the university or its donors. SUTD: It offers 173 scholarships and 43 bursaries, excluding government ones. SIT: More than 10 per cent of students are on scholarships or sponsorships by their employers or prospective employers. UniSIM: About a dozen scholarships, such as the SIM University Scholarship, and bursaries, such as the Ministry of Education Bursary, are available to students. STUDENT RESIDENCES NUS: The six halls of residence, four student residences and five residential colleges offer about 11,000 places in all for full-time students. A one-week stay in a typical single, non-air-conditioned room costs between $110 and $130. NTU: Its 18 residential halls house more than 10,400 undergraduates. Rental fees range from $225 to $280 monthly for a twin-sharing room. SMU: It does not have any student residences for local students. SUTD: It has three student housing blocks with a capacity of around 1,100 beds. Depending on the room type, an undergraduate typically pays around $350 to $480 per month. SIT: It does not offer any student residences. UniSIM: It does not have any student accommodation. OVERSEAS EXPOSURE NUS: About 70 per cent of undergraduates have at least an overseas exposure stint, such as summer school or internships. NTU: Some 80 per cent of students get some form of overseas exposure, such as taking classes at a partner university overseas. SMU: About 86 per cent of students have some form of overseas exposure, mainly through student exchange programmes. SUTD: Nearly 60 per cent of undergraduates have overseas experience. SIT: All students taking programmes offered by its partner universities abroad must go for an Overseas Immersion Programme as part of the curriculum. They spend between three and 17 weeks at the home campus of the university. Also, nearly all undergraduates doing SIT's own programmes have gone on study trips and work-study initiatives overseas. UniSIM: Its full-time students must go for an overseas stint during their studies. Currently, they have not started their stints, which may include a work attachment programme or a service learning project.",12.08536779228011

To attract the best students, the universities are striving to be different - in their programmes, tuition fees, student and faculty mix, accommodation options, financial help and overseas opportunities. Calvin Yang looks at the options offered. FULL-TIME DEGREE PROGRAMMES National University of Singapore (NUS): It has more than 50 full-time degrees, with exclusive ones such as those in dentistry, music and pharmacy. Nanyang Technological University (NTU): It has more than 50 degrees, with niche programmes such as communication studies, and sport science and management. Singapore Management University (SMU): It offers seven full-time programmes such as accountancy, law, information systems management and an SUTD-SMU dual degree programme in technology and management, launched last year. Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD): Its five degrees include architecture and sustainable design, engineering product development, engineering systems and design, and information systems technology and design. Singapore Institute of Technology (SIT): Catering mainly to polytechnic graduates, the university has 36 programmes - some offered by reputable partner universities and others run solely by SIT. The programmes include culinary arts management, criminology and security, game design and naval architecture. SIM University (UniSIM): The university synonymous with part-time degrees recently started offering full-time programmes in accountancy, finance and marketing. It will introduce a fourth full-time degree in human resource management this year. TUITION FEES These are for Singaporean students admitted in the academic year 2014/2015, except for UniSIM undergraduates. NUS: Annual tuition fees range between $7,850 - for courses like computing, engineering, and arts and social sciences - and $24,200 for medicine and dentistry. NTU: Fees are between $7,850 for most programmes, and $31,500 for medical students. SMU: Undergraduates who started last August are paying $11,100 per year, except for law students, who are paying $12,300. SUTD: An education at the university costs $11,650 per year. SIT: Annual fees range from $10,100 to $15,300. UniSIM: This year's accountancy students will pay about $33,000 for the entire degree programme, while students from other programmes will pay about $31,000. FINANCIAL HELP NUS: It has a wide range of scholarships and financial aid available. Over the past five years, it has seen a two-fold increase in students receiving scholarships, from about 800 in 2009 to 1,650 in 2013. There was a 60 per cent increase in the number of students receiving bursaries over the same period. NTU: For the new academic year that starts in August, it will be providing about 500 full-term scholarships, namely the Nanyang Scholarship and College Scholarship. Singaporean students interested in taking up a bursary each will receive assistance as long as their household per capita income is $1,900 or less per month. SMU: It has a comprehensive range of financial schemes. For scholarships, about 60 per cent of those who apply have been successful in securing a scholarship supported by the university or its donors. SUTD: It offers 173 scholarships and 43 bursaries, excluding government ones. SIT: More than 10 per cent of students are on scholarships or sponsorships by their employers or prospective employers. UniSIM: About a dozen scholarships, such as the SIM University Scholarship, and bursaries, such as the Ministry of Education Bursary, are available to students. STUDENT RESIDENCES NUS: The six halls of residence, four student residences and five residential colleges offer about 11,000 places in all for full-time students. A one-week stay in a typical single, non-air-conditioned room costs between $110 and $130. NTU: Its 18 residential halls house more than 10,400 undergraduates. Rental fees range from $225 to $280 monthly for a twin-sharing room. SMU: It does not have any student residences for local students. SUTD: It has three student housing blocks with a capacity of around 1,100 beds. Depending on the room type, an undergraduate typically pays around $350 to $480 per month. SIT: It does not offer any student residences. UniSIM: It does not have any student accommodation. OVERSEAS EXPOSURE NUS: About 70 per cent of undergraduates have at least an overseas exposure stint, such as summer school or internships. NTU: Some 80 per cent of students get some form of overseas exposure, such as taking classes at a partner university overseas. SMU: About 86 per cent of students have some form of overseas exposure, mainly through student exchange programmes. SUTD: Nearly 60 per cent of undergraduates have overseas experience. SIT: All students taking programmes offered by its partner universities abroad must go for an Overseas Immersion Programme as part of the curriculum. They spend between three and 17 weeks at the home campus of the university. Also, nearly all undergraduates doing SIT's own programmes have gone on study trips and work-study initiatives overseas. UniSIM: Its full-time students must go for an overseas stint during their studies. Currently, they have not started their stints, which may include a work attachment programme or a service learning project.",12.08536779228011

Dean level are too high, they dont micro-manage down to the undergraduate admissions level. At most they do get involved in grad students admissions. Try appealing to an Assoc Prof or an Asst Prof.  2. I believe there is only one window of official appeal. Any appeals outside of the NTU system(ie. directly to the prof) would be counted as informal appeals. 4. Soci is essay and exam based.

STUDENT RESIDENCES NUS: The six halls of residence, four student residences and five residential colleges offer about 11,000 places in all for full-time students. A one-week stay in a typical single, non-air-conditioned room costs between $110 and $130. NTU: Its 18 residential halls house more than 10,400 undergraduates. Rental fees range from $225 to $280 monthly for a twin-sharing room. SMU: It does not have any student residences for local students. SUTD: It has three student housing blocks with a capacity of around 1,100 beds. Depending on the room type, an undergraduate typically pays around $350 to $480 per month. SIT: It does not offer any student residences. UniSIM: It does not have any student accommodation. OVERSEAS EXPOSURE NUS: About 70 per cent of undergraduates have at least an overseas exposure stint, such as summer school or internships. NTU: Some 80 per cent of students get some form of overseas exposure, such as taking classes at a partner university overseas. SMU: About 86 per cent of students have some form of overseas exposure, mainly through student exchange programmes. SUTD: Nearly 60 per cent of undergraduates have overseas experience. SIT: All students taking programmes offered by its partner universities abroad must go for an Overseas Immersion Programme as part of the curriculum. They spend between three and 17 weeks at the home campus of the university. Also, nearly all undergraduates doing SIT's own programmes have gone on study trips and work-study initiatives overseas. UniSIM: Its full-time students must go for an overseas stint during their studies. Currently, they have not started their stints, which may include a work attachment programme or a service learning project.",12.08536779228011

Try appealing to an Assoc Prof or an Asst Prof.  2. I believe there is only one window of official appeal.

2015,Singapore Management University|smu,Saint Andrew's Junior College|saint andrews junior college|saint andrews jc|sajc|computer|com|infosys|information systems|analytics,"How Singapore's six public universities differ Published in ST on 3 March 2015http://www.straitstimes.com/singapor...rsities-differ With six public universities, students now have a diverse range of degrees to choose from. To attract the best students, the universities are striving to be different - in their programmes, tuition fees, student and faculty mix, accommodation options, financial help and overseas opportunities. Calvin Yang looks at the options offered. FULL-TIME DEGREE PROGRAMMES National University of Singapore (NUS): It has more than 50 full-time degrees, with exclusive ones such as those in dentistry, music and pharmacy. Nanyang Technological University (NTU): It has more than 50 degrees, with niche programmes such as communication studies, and sport science and management. Singapore Management University (SMU): It offers seven full-time programmes such as accountancy, law, information systems management and an SUTD-SMU dual degree programme in technology and management, launched last year. Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD): Its five degrees include architecture and sustainable design, engineering product development, engineering systems and design, and information systems technology and design. Singapore Institute of Technology (SIT): Catering mainly to polytechnic graduates, the university has 36 programmes - some offered by reputable partner universities and others run solely by SIT. The programmes include culinary arts management, criminology and security, game design and naval architecture. SIM University (UniSIM): The university synonymous with part-time degrees recently started offering full-time programmes in accountancy, finance and marketing. It will introduce a fourth full-time degree in human resource management this year. TUITION FEES These are for Singaporean students admitted in the academic year 2014/2015, except for UniSIM undergraduates. NUS: Annual tuition fees range between $7,850 - for courses like computing, engineering, and arts and social sciences - and $24,200 for medicine and dentistry. NTU: Fees are between $7,850 for most programmes, and $31,500 for medical students. SMU: Undergraduates who started last August are paying $11,100 per year, except for law students, who are paying $12,300. SUTD: An education at the university costs $11,650 per year. SIT: Annual fees range from $10,100 to $15,300. UniSIM: This year's accountancy students will pay about $33,000 for the entire degree programme, while students from other programmes will pay about $31,000. FINANCIAL HELP NUS: It has a wide range of scholarships and financial aid available. Over the past five years, it has seen a two-fold increase in students receiving scholarships, from about 800 in 2009 to 1,650 in 2013. There was a 60 per cent increase in the number of students receiving bursaries over the same period. NTU: For the new academic year that starts in August, it will be providing about 500 full-term scholarships, namely the Nanyang Scholarship and College Scholarship. Singaporean students interested in taking up a bursary each will receive assistance as long as their household per capita income is $1,900 or less per month. SMU: It has a comprehensive range of financial schemes. For scholarships, about 60 per cent of those who apply have been successful in securing a scholarship supported by the university or its donors. SUTD: It offers 173 scholarships and 43 bursaries, excluding government ones. SIT: More than 10 per cent of students are on scholarships or sponsorships by their employers or prospective employers. UniSIM: About a dozen scholarships, such as the SIM University Scholarship, and bursaries, such as the Ministry of Education Bursary, are available to students. STUDENT RESIDENCES NUS: The six halls of residence, four student residences and five residential colleges offer about 11,000 places in all for full-time students. A one-week stay in a typical single, non-air-conditioned room costs between $110 and $130. NTU: Its 18 residential halls house more than 10,400 undergraduates. Rental fees range from $225 to $280 monthly for a twin-sharing room. SMU: It does not have any student residences for local students. SUTD: It has three student housing blocks with a capacity of around 1,100 beds. Depending on the room type, an undergraduate typically pays around $350 to $480 per month. SIT: It does not offer any student residences. UniSIM: It does not have any student accommodation. OVERSEAS EXPOSURE NUS: About 70 per cent of undergraduates have at least an overseas exposure stint, such as summer school or internships. NTU: Some 80 per cent of students get some form of overseas exposure, such as taking classes at a partner university overseas. SMU: About 86 per cent of students have some form of overseas exposure, mainly through student exchange programmes. SUTD: Nearly 60 per cent of undergraduates have overseas experience. SIT: All students taking programmes offered by its partner universities abroad must go for an Overseas Immersion Programme as part of the curriculum. They spend between three and 17 weeks at the home campus of the university. Also, nearly all undergraduates doing SIT's own programmes have gone on study trips and work-study initiatives overseas. UniSIM: Its full-time students must go for an overseas stint during their studies. Currently, they have not started their stints, which may include a work attachment programme or a service learning project.",12.08536779228011

2015,Singapore Management University|smu,St. Joseph's Institution|sji|computer|com|infosys|information systems|analytics,"How Singapore's six public universities differ Published in ST on 3 March 2015http://www.straitstimes.com/singapor...rsities-differ With six public universities, students now have a diverse range of degrees to choose from. To attract the best students, the universities are striving to be different - in their programmes, tuition fees, student and faculty mix, accommodation options, financial help and overseas opportunities. Calvin Yang looks at the options offered. FULL-TIME DEGREE PROGRAMMES National University of Singapore (NUS): It has more than 50 full-time degrees, with exclusive ones such as those in dentistry, music and pharmacy. Nanyang Technological University (NTU): It has more than 50 degrees, with niche programmes such as communication studies, and sport science and management. Singapore Management University (SMU): It offers seven full-time programmes such as accountancy, law, information systems management and an SUTD-SMU dual degree programme in technology and management, launched last year. Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD): Its five degrees include architecture and sustainable design, engineering product development, engineering systems and design, and information systems technology and design. Singapore Institute of Technology (SIT): Catering mainly to polytechnic graduates, the university has 36 programmes - some offered by reputable partner universities and others run solely by SIT. The programmes include culinary arts management, criminology and security, game design and naval architecture. SIM University (UniSIM): The university synonymous with part-time degrees recently started offering full-time programmes in accountancy, finance and marketing. It will introduce a fourth full-time degree in human resource management this year. TUITION FEES These are for Singaporean students admitted in the academic year 2014/2015, except for UniSIM undergraduates. NUS: Annual tuition fees range between $7,850 - for courses like computing, engineering, and arts and social sciences - and $24,200 for medicine and dentistry. NTU: Fees are between $7,850 for most programmes, and $31,500 for medical students. SMU: Undergraduates who started last August are paying $11,100 per year, except for law students, who are paying $12,300. SUTD: An education at the university costs $11,650 per year. SIT: Annual fees range from $10,100 to $15,300. UniSIM: This year's accountancy students will pay about $33,000 for the entire degree programme, while students from other programmes will pay about $31,000. FINANCIAL HELP NUS: It has a wide range of scholarships and financial aid available. Over the past five years, it has seen a two-fold increase in students receiving scholarships, from about 800 in 2009 to 1,650 in 2013. There was a 60 per cent increase in the number of students receiving bursaries over the same period. NTU: For the new academic year that starts in August, it will be providing about 500 full-term scholarships, namely the Nanyang Scholarship and College Scholarship. Singaporean students interested in taking up a bursary each will receive assistance as long as their household per capita income is $1,900 or less per month. SMU: It has a comprehensive range of financial schemes. For scholarships, about 60 per cent of those who apply have been successful in securing a scholarship supported by the university or its donors. SUTD: It offers 173 scholarships and 43 bursaries, excluding government ones. SIT: More than 10 per cent of students are on scholarships or sponsorships by their employers or prospective employers. UniSIM: About a dozen scholarships, such as the SIM University Scholarship, and bursaries, such as the Ministry of Education Bursary, are available to students. STUDENT RESIDENCES NUS: The six halls of residence, four student residences and five residential colleges offer about 11,000 places in all for full-time students. A one-week stay in a typical single, non-air-conditioned room costs between $110 and $130. NTU: Its 18 residential halls house more than 10,400 undergraduates. Rental fees range from $225 to $280 monthly for a twin-sharing room. SMU: It does not have any student residences for local students. SUTD: It has three student housing blocks with a capacity of around 1,100 beds. Depending on the room type, an undergraduate typically pays around $350 to $480 per month. SIT: It does not offer any student residences. UniSIM: It does not have any student accommodation. OVERSEAS EXPOSURE NUS: About 70 per cent of undergraduates have at least an overseas exposure stint, such as summer school or internships. NTU: Some 80 per cent of students get some form of overseas exposure, such as taking classes at a partner university overseas. SMU: About 86 per cent of students have some form of overseas exposure, mainly through student exchange programmes. SUTD: Nearly 60 per cent of undergraduates have overseas experience. SIT: All students taking programmes offered by its partner universities abroad must go for an Overseas Immersion Programme as part of the curriculum. They spend between three and 17 weeks at the home campus of the university. Also, nearly all undergraduates doing SIT's own programmes have gone on study trips and work-study initiatives overseas. UniSIM: Its full-time students must go for an overseas stint during their studies. Currently, they have not started their stints, which may include a work attachment programme or a service learning project.",12.08536779228011

Dean level are too high, they dont micro-manage down to the undergraduate admissions level. At most they do get involved in grad students admissions. Try appealing to an Assoc Prof or an Asst Prof.  2. I believe there is only one window of official appeal.

Hmmm. Then I'm pretty much as lost as you. haha. The only reason would be that there are better scorers this year applying for the courses you applied for. Humanities is always getting more popular here while STEM courses are getting less popular. We will only know in December when the new IGP for this year comes out when we can see how much the IGP has risen.  If your grades are good, I'd recommend that you try again next year. This time, apply strategically, put courses that are clearly in reach (safely above IGP) as your first choice. It looks like an RP of 72.5 just matches both SMU SS and NTU Soci. This is cutting it too close in my opinion. You'd want to apply for courses like English, History or Chinese where you are above the IGP. In the meantime, work/intern or volunteer at some organisations first. Or even retake your A-levels to get a better grade set if you're confident.",9.454560038675353

That said, I'm pretty devastated. I think the most infuriating part is not knowing what I had done wrong to be rejected. My GPA sits well within the IGP range and I personally know of people who had a lower GPA than mine but successfully secured a place in Sociology. I can only deduce that my poor O levels spoiled the chances for me. BUT whether it is truly because of this reason, I cannot be really sure - and this is the frustrating part.  What do they use to calculate the O levels component? Is it L1R5 or L1B4?    What should I do now? Can any seniors advise me please?

To attract the best students, the universities are striving to be different - in their programmes, tuition fees, student and faculty mix, accommodation options, financial help and overseas opportunities. Calvin Yang looks at the options offered. FULL-TIME DEGREE PROGRAMMES National University of Singapore (NUS): It has more than 50 full-time degrees, with exclusive ones such as those in dentistry, music and pharmacy. Nanyang Technological University (NTU): It has more than 50 degrees, with niche programmes such as communication studies, and sport science and management.

FINANCIAL HELP NUS: It has a wide range of scholarships and financial aid available. Over the past five years, it has seen a two-fold increase in students receiving scholarships, from about 800 in 2009 to 1,650 in 2013. There was a 60 per cent increase in the number of students receiving bursaries over the same period.

UniSIM: About a dozen scholarships, such as the SIM University Scholarship, and bursaries, such as the Ministry of Education Bursary, are available to students. STUDENT RESIDENCES NUS: The six halls of residence, four student residences and five residential colleges offer about 11,000 places in all for full-time students. A one-week stay in a typical single, non-air-conditioned room costs between $110 and $130. NTU: Its 18 residential halls house more than 10,400 undergraduates. Rental fees range from $225 to $280 monthly for a twin-sharing room. SMU: It does not have any student residences for local students. SUTD: It has three student housing blocks with a capacity of around 1,100 beds. Depending on the room type, an undergraduate typically pays around $350 to $480 per month.

2015,Singapore Management University|smu,Temasek Junior College|temasek jc|tjc|computer|com|infosys|information systems|analytics,"How Singapore's six public universities differ Published in ST on 3 March 2015http://www.straitstimes.com/singapor...rsities-differ With six public universities, students now have a diverse range of degrees to choose from. To attract the best students, the universities are striving to be different - in their programmes, tuition fees, student and faculty mix, accommodation options, financial help and overseas opportunities. Calvin Yang looks at the options offered. FULL-TIME DEGREE PROGRAMMES National University of Singapore (NUS): It has more than 50 full-time degrees, with exclusive ones such as those in dentistry, music and pharmacy. Nanyang Technological University (NTU): It has more than 50 degrees, with niche programmes such as communication studies, and sport science and management. Singapore Management University (SMU): It offers seven full-time programmes such as accountancy, law, information systems management and an SUTD-SMU dual degree programme in technology and management, launched last year. Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD): Its five degrees include architecture and sustainable design, engineering product development, engineering systems and design, and information systems technology and design. Singapore Institute of Technology (SIT): Catering mainly to polytechnic graduates, the university has 36 programmes - some offered by reputable partner universities and others run solely by SIT. The programmes include culinary arts management, criminology and security, game design and naval architecture. SIM University (UniSIM): The university synonymous with part-time degrees recently started offering full-time programmes in accountancy, finance and marketing. It will introduce a fourth full-time degree in human resource management this year. TUITION FEES These are for Singaporean students admitted in the academic year 2014/2015, except for UniSIM undergraduates. NUS: Annual tuition fees range between $7,850 - for courses like computing, engineering, and arts and social sciences - and $24,200 for medicine and dentistry. NTU: Fees are between $7,850 for most programmes, and $31,500 for medical students. SMU: Undergraduates who started last August are paying $11,100 per year, except for law students, who are paying $12,300. SUTD: An education at the university costs $11,650 per year. SIT: Annual fees range from $10,100 to $15,300. UniSIM: This year's accountancy students will pay about $33,000 for the entire degree programme, while students from other programmes will pay about $31,000. FINANCIAL HELP NUS: It has a wide range of scholarships and financial aid available. Over the past five years, it has seen a two-fold increase in students receiving scholarships, from about 800 in 2009 to 1,650 in 2013. There was a 60 per cent increase in the number of students receiving bursaries over the same period. NTU: For the new academic year that starts in August, it will be providing about 500 full-term scholarships, namely the Nanyang Scholarship and College Scholarship. Singaporean students interested in taking up a bursary each will receive assistance as long as their household per capita income is $1,900 or less per month. SMU: It has a comprehensive range of financial schemes. For scholarships, about 60 per cent of those who apply have been successful in securing a scholarship supported by the university or its donors. SUTD: It offers 173 scholarships and 43 bursaries, excluding government ones. SIT: More than 10 per cent of students are on scholarships or sponsorships by their employers or prospective employers. UniSIM: About a dozen scholarships, such as the SIM University Scholarship, and bursaries, such as the Ministry of Education Bursary, are available to students. STUDENT RESIDENCES NUS: The six halls of residence, four student residences and five residential colleges offer about 11,000 places in all for full-time students. A one-week stay in a typical single, non-air-conditioned room costs between $110 and $130. NTU: Its 18 residential halls house more than 10,400 undergraduates. Rental fees range from $225 to $280 monthly for a twin-sharing room. SMU: It does not have any student residences for local students. SUTD: It has three student housing blocks with a capacity of around 1,100 beds. Depending on the room type, an undergraduate typically pays around $350 to $480 per month. SIT: It does not offer any student residences. UniSIM: It does not have any student accommodation. OVERSEAS EXPOSURE NUS: About 70 per cent of undergraduates have at least an overseas exposure stint, such as summer school or internships. NTU: Some 80 per cent of students get some form of overseas exposure, such as taking classes at a partner university overseas. SMU: About 86 per cent of students have some form of overseas exposure, mainly through student exchange programmes. SUTD: Nearly 60 per cent of undergraduates have overseas experience. SIT: All students taking programmes offered by its partner universities abroad must go for an Overseas Immersion Programme as part of the curriculum. They spend between three and 17 weeks at the home campus of the university. Also, nearly all undergraduates doing SIT's own programmes have gone on study trips and work-study initiatives overseas. UniSIM: Its full-time students must go for an overseas stint during their studies. Currently, they have not started their stints, which may include a work attachment programme or a service learning project.",12.08536779228011

Dean level are too high, they dont micro-manage down to the undergraduate admissions level. At most they do get involved in grad students admissions. Try appealing to an Assoc Prof or an Asst Prof.  2. I believe there is only one window of official appeal. Any appeals outside of the NTU system(ie. directly to the prof) would be counted as informal appeals. 4. Soci is essay and exam based.

Certainly the Single Degree saves about 0.5-1 year, but the opportunity cost of that doesn't seem that significant to me, especially if I can gain some extra expertise. I'm quite sure that I can cope with the workload also.  Would an extra Business degree offer significantly more flexibility? Right now, I'm thinking of becoming a forensic accountant, but of course that may change and I'd like to keep my options open -- maybe I'll go into banking/management-type jobs if I find them interesting. Does anyone have any insight about which type of degree I should choose? ",8.220210788051602
2015,Singapore Management University|smu,Victoria Junior College|Victoria jc|vjc|computer|com|infosys|information systems|analytics,"How Singapore's six public universities differ Published in ST on 3 March 2015http://www.straitstimes.com/singapor...rsities-differ With six public universities, students now have a diverse range of degrees to choose from. To attract the best students, the universities are striving to be different - in their programmes, tuition fees, student and faculty mix, accommodation options, financial help and overseas opportunities. Calvin Yang looks at the options offered. FULL-TIME DEGREE PROGRAMMES National University of Singapore (NUS): It has more than 50 full-time degrees, with exclusive ones such as those in dentistry, music and pharmacy. Nanyang Technological University (NTU): It has more than 50 degrees, with niche programmes such as communication studies, and sport science and management. Singapore Management University (SMU): It offers seven full-time programmes such as accountancy, law, information systems management and an SUTD-SMU dual degree programme in technology and management, launched last year. Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD): Its five degrees include architecture and sustainable design, engineering product development, engineering systems and design, and information systems technology and design. Singapore Institute of Technology (SIT): Catering mainly to polytechnic graduates, the university has 36 programmes - some offered by reputable partner universities and others run solely by SIT. The programmes include culinary arts management, criminology and security, game design and naval architecture. SIM University (UniSIM): The university synonymous with part-time degrees recently started offering full-time programmes in accountancy, finance and marketing. It will introduce a fourth full-time degree in human resource management this year. TUITION FEES These are for Singaporean students admitted in the academic year 2014/2015, except for UniSIM undergraduates. NUS: Annual tuition fees range between $7,850 - for courses like computing, engineering, and arts and social sciences - and $24,200 for medicine and dentistry. NTU: Fees are between $7,850 for most programmes, and $31,500 for medical students. SMU: Undergraduates who started last August are paying $11,100 per year, except for law students, who are paying $12,300. SUTD: An education at the university costs $11,650 per year. SIT: Annual fees range from $10,100 to $15,300. UniSIM: This year's accountancy students will pay about $33,000 for the entire degree programme, while students from other programmes will pay about $31,000. FINANCIAL HELP NUS: It has a wide range of scholarships and financial aid available. Over the past five years, it has seen a two-fold increase in students receiving scholarships, from about 800 in 2009 to 1,650 in 2013. There was a 60 per cent increase in the number of students receiving bursaries over the same period. NTU: For the new academic year that starts in August, it will be providing about 500 full-term scholarships, namely the Nanyang Scholarship and College Scholarship. Singaporean students interested in taking up a bursary each will receive assistance as long as their household per capita income is $1,900 or less per month. SMU: It has a comprehensive range of financial schemes. For scholarships, about 60 per cent of those who apply have been successful in securing a scholarship supported by the university or its donors. SUTD: It offers 173 scholarships and 43 bursaries, excluding government ones. SIT: More than 10 per cent of students are on scholarships or sponsorships by their employers or prospective employers. UniSIM: About a dozen scholarships, such as the SIM University Scholarship, and bursaries, such as the Ministry of Education Bursary, are available to students. STUDENT RESIDENCES NUS: The six halls of residence, four student residences and five residential colleges offer about 11,000 places in all for full-time students. A one-week stay in a typical single, non-air-conditioned room costs between $110 and $130. NTU: Its 18 residential halls house more than 10,400 undergraduates. Rental fees range from $225 to $280 monthly for a twin-sharing room. SMU: It does not have any student residences for local students. SUTD: It has three student housing blocks with a capacity of around 1,100 beds. Depending on the room type, an undergraduate typically pays around $350 to $480 per month. SIT: It does not offer any student residences. UniSIM: It does not have any student accommodation. OVERSEAS EXPOSURE NUS: About 70 per cent of undergraduates have at least an overseas exposure stint, such as summer school or internships. NTU: Some 80 per cent of students get some form of overseas exposure, such as taking classes at a partner university overseas. SMU: About 86 per cent of students have some form of overseas exposure, mainly through student exchange programmes. SUTD: Nearly 60 per cent of undergraduates have overseas experience. SIT: All students taking programmes offered by its partner universities abroad must go for an Overseas Immersion Programme as part of the curriculum. They spend between three and 17 weeks at the home campus of the university. Also, nearly all undergraduates doing SIT's own programmes have gone on study trips and work-study initiatives overseas. UniSIM: Its full-time students must go for an overseas stint during their studies. Currently, they have not started their stints, which may include a work attachment programme or a service learning project.",12.08536779228011

Dean level are too high, they dont micro-manage down to the undergraduate admissions level. At most they do get involved in grad students admissions. Try appealing to an Assoc Prof or an Asst Prof.  2. I believe there is only one window of official appeal.

That said, I'm pretty devastated. I think the most infuriating part is not knowing what I had done wrong to be rejected. My GPA sits well within the IGP range and I personally know of people who had a lower GPA than mine but successfully secured a place in Sociology. I can only deduce that my poor O levels spoiled the chances for me. BUT whether it is truly because of this reason, I cannot be really sure - and this is the frustrating part.  What do they use to calculate the O levels component? Is it L1R5 or L1B4?    What should I do now? Can any seniors advise me please?

2016,Singapore Management University|smu,Republic Polytechnic|Republic poly|rp|computer|com|infosys|information systems|analytics,"Which university? Which course of study?Aim for a course that best suits you, rather than enrol in the most lucrative one Tan Eng Chye Prof Tan is deputy president (academic affairs) and provost at the National University of Singapore. PUBLISHED 6 HOURS AGOhttp://www.straitstimes.com/singapor...ourse-of-study The university admissions season is in full swing, and this is an exciting time for students in Singapore. The tertiary education landscape here has expanded significantly, and there are now many varied and interesting pathways for students to choose from, from traditional professional degree courses in medicine or engineering, to music and the liberal arts and science. Many parents I met at the National University of Singapore's (NUS) Open Day last month remarked that they are envious of the plethora of choices their children have, and wish to be young once more. Some of you may have secured multiple offers from different universities in Singapore and overseas, and you will have to make an acceptance decision soon. But how should one decide? Every year, the Ministry of Education publishes the employment rates and median starting salaries of fresh graduates of the different degree programmes offered by local universities. I certainly hope students do not make decisions based solely on data obtained through the Graduate Employment Survey (GES). GES data provides an indication of starting salaries. Starting salaries are but a guide; they neither set the course nor determine one's career trajectory or destiny. In this volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous or "Vuca" world, one cannot predict the future or where the lucrative jobs will be. You would therefore want your university education to equip you with broad-based life skills, and develop you with the flexibility and resilience needed to pick up new knowledge, adapt to new circumstances, and exploit job opportunities across a variety of sectors throughout your lifetime of careers. Another consideration is whether and how the university course adds value to your educational journey. Some students (and parents) may look to university rankings as a measure of the strength of a university department. And there are definitely synergies between research and education. If the university department excels in research, and counts world-leading researchers in the field, it is likely that cutting-edge research will filter through to your learning experience. You will have the opportunity to be taught by highly regarded academics, and there will be plenty of opportunities to conduct research under the who's-who in the field. This is particularly valuable if you have a very strong interest in research or academia. Choosing a university that excels in your area of interest may also open up more specialised opportunities, such as advanced facilities, academic opportunities such as overseas study or research trips, as well as internships and employment opportunities with prestigious organisations in the industry. Beyond academic reputation, your choice of university will also affect your life intellectually, socially and professionally. You should evaluate the entire student experience, and whether it will suit you. Find out if the social setting on campus is what you would want to be part of. NUS has, for example, the Yale-NUS College and the University Town Residential College programmes, which offer an integrated living and learning experience, amid a collegial and intellectually vibrant setting. Another distinctive programme is the NUS Overseas Colleges programme, where students get to live, work and study in an entrepreneurial hub such as Silicon Valley, New York City or Stockholm, taking entrepreneurship classes at a partner university while working in promising entrepreneurial start-ups. All universities have carefully developed their own suite of programmes and it is worth your time and effort to find out what is on offer. Talk to the professors, and to current students. Universities hold Open Days and various outreach sessions where you can visit the campus and get first-hand information. The best-ranked university or the programme that offers you two degrees in the shortest duration may sound attractive, but they may not necessarily be what you are looking for.  Some of you may want an intensely academic experience, and to pick up as many degrees in the shortest possible time. Yet others may prefer to develop a broader range of capabilities, to try out new things, or to pursue more varied experiences. You should aim to identify a university and a course that best suits you, and not simply enrol in the most competitive or lucrative course. After all, you will be spending your next three to four years in this programme. For those of you whose grades may not meet the degree programme's published entry requirements, do not give up. All local universities have discretionary admissions schemes. Last year, NUS interviewed a record 1,600 students under the scheme, and admitted 670 students. This scheme allows universities to assess applicants more holistically, and to consider their passions and attributes such as leadership, resilience or entrepreneurial skills or talent in non-academic areas. The good news is that from the next academic year onwards, NUS, Nanyang Technological University and Singapore Management University can take in more students under the Discretionary Admissions Scheme, from 10 per cent of the annual intake currently, to up to 15 per cent. This will enable more students to enter universities on the basis of their strengths and talents, beyond academic performance. There is no perfect university. What is key is to make a considered decision with the resources and information that are available to you. Your degree should help start you on the journey to where you want to go. The knowledge, experiences and opportunities in your university life should also prepare you for life beyond your degree. As a student in Singapore, you will have up to the beginning of June to decide on your offers from most of the local universities. Whatever you eventually decide on, make the most of your university experience because, for many, it will be the best time of your life.",14.777022321864948

I was hoping to get some advice from you guys here. Firstly, Congrats to all those who have successful applications. To those who are still waiting, or got rejected, don't feel despair, i'm pretty sure you'll find your way out. Like a professional juggler once told me, his biggest lesson in juggling isn't any particular technically-advanced sleights, but this: "When the ball drops, pick it up." Simple, but means a lot. Now, my story: I am from the '94 batch. Took my A levels in 2012, flunk it really badly, because I was heavily distracted by relationship issues (broke up with my ex, which caused a whole landslide trail of problems. But that's another whole long story, and besides the point). I barely studied during A levels then, and entered the exam hall hoping to fail. But miraculously, i scraped through it, and wasn't allowed to retain in JC. The resultant problem: Straight C result, with one S grade. Devastatingly embarrassing, and was a crushing defeat. You see, I come from an IP school, and that technically means that, should I flunk my A levels, all i'm equivalent of is a Primary 6 standard. So here I am, half of my life, effectively erased on papers. I gone on to enlist in NS, and kept my report card hidden away in the "shameful" corner of my room, collecting dust. After NS, i decided to take a break, took a gap year, all these while, casting aside any thoughts on studies and the education system. I went on to completing 1 internship, and 2 other jobs, as well as backpacking around Europe, South East Asia and Australia. It was fulfilling, and definitely a worthwhile experience. But now, 3 years after receiving my poor A levels result, I finally decided to get back on to the system, and apply for university. Expectedly, even with DA (I was a former national athlete, and I had my employers write in recommendation letters), I was sorrowfully rejected. This time, it hit me hard, after all these years of "escaping", I was finally facing the music, and there and then i knew I had to do sth with my life to move on.TL;DR: I still want to enter university. I know i can do better than that "shitty" result i've got. So here's what I came for, hoping for someone to offer me some advice. Personally, I am contemplating on retaking A levels. My previous subject combination was PMEE. I know my science practical grades could no longer be used, so i have to go to a private institution to do it. I am considering going to MDIS and follow its system. (Question, does anybody have any experience or knowledge or advice on MDIS? Is it a good choice for me?) On top of that, I am intending on going for private tuition to brush up my skills, because i've heard that MDIS tutors aren't the best, or at least they aren't as good as JC MOE teachers. (So, does anybody know of any good 1-to-1 tutors, that could give you undivided attention?) Lastly, is anybody here intending to repeat A levels, I was hoping to form a study group of a couple students, and mug together, and we could encourage one another. This is my one shot, i'm giving my all, and keeping my head in the game. Thank you for reading, hope to get some responses. Really sorry to learn of your predicament. Im in a same situation as u, also from ip. Registration for re taking a levels this year as private candidate has alrdy ended. Have u tried applying to private unis such as sim? Im still waiting for smu and sim to get back to me. If all else fails, maybe we can retake together! If thats the case, i might change my combi to science instead of arts haha",14.403463801772494
2016,Singapore Management University|smu,Republic Polytechnic|Republic poly|rp|computer|com|infosys|information systems|analytics,"DISCLAIMER: I'd like to say that this post is not meant to flame anyone or put a negative spotlight on anyone. The examples I highlighted below are simply the comments/questions that I spotted which inspired me to write this. I wouldn't want to start a discussion about education in Singapore here, nor would this a debate for JC vs Poly. Just a little background about myself - I was a comms student in poly, did pretty average for my GPA (3.5x), missed the uni application in my first year of army, got rejected by NTU ADM last year, finally got a late acceptance letter from ADM this year. So trust me when I say I can empathise with those who are still waiting for their acceptance letter, and why some people are asking certain questions here.Spoiler!Hi guys, care to give your opinions and views on SMU Business VS NUS Statistics?  Which one will have higher demand by employers? The answer to this is simple, ask yourself where do you want to work? MNC? Local startup? The big 4? Starting your own business? Government sector? The 'value' of a degree is only given to by the people looking at it. Even then, there are those companies in each category that would defy the stereotypical hiring policy. So my advice to the poster who asked this question is to define who are your said 'employers' first. If you have no idea where you want to work or which sector of business you want to be in, it might serve you better to understand more about the course to see which specific programme/school/school culture might suit you better rather which degree appeals more to 'employers'. It's better to make an informed choice yourself.Spoiler!Actually, people do look at where you study. I got a couple of friends in HR. They told me that they would also look at the university, course, GPA/grades, modules taken, then any leadership roles regardless of how many years of relevant work experience a person has. Some say they tend to give more priority to old boys/girls, alum, that sort of thing. I'm not saying you're wrong here buddy, and in fact you're correct in saying this! But like I mentioned previously, it depends on where you're applying for work at, what is the company's hiring policy, what are they looking for etc. Comments like this might mislead some to think that this one degree/choice of school will make or break their future. What your friends experienced are the hiring policies of their particular companies they work at, but it's definitely not the same across various companies.There's no 'one size fits all' answer to certain questions. There is also no 'only one single path' to success. Some students don't realise it yet. This is the point that I'm driving at - Students should not be afraid to seek out multiple answers to a single question. There is always more than one way to solve a single question. Isn't that how it is for Math too? There may be one solution given in the answer book but it doesn't mean that that's the only one.If you do not get your university placing in the public schools this year, there are many other options! For poly students, you can take a gap year and work first, try again next year or the year after, like what I was planning to do myself should I not get my placing this year. Work experience ain't a bad idea too. For JC students, you can always take the A's again (like what some here are planning to do), to get a better grade for your dream course on the next application. I had a friend who couldn't get pharmaceutical, retook his A's while serving NS, scored a much better grade and went on to pharmaceutical on a scholarship in the end. If you really want to study this year, then private schools might be a viable idea as well. Yes things might not have gone according to plan for you. You might have been taught your whole life that you must get into NTU/NUS/SMU, or that might have been pressure on yourself. But fact is, if you're not getting in (even after appeal), then it's on you to take your next step forward. You have to keep moving forward in life despite the obstacles you face. If you're really rejected in the end, allow yourself to be sad for a little while, then pick yourself up, make plans, take the next step forward and move on. You might have to take a little detour, but it doesn't mean you can't get there. It's just how badly you want it. I hope this lengthy post written at 3am in the morning would encourage some of you even a little, because I know what it's like to constantly fail at every turn and have life keep pushing you down. If it did, then I'm glad. ",13.876229230873168

SMU received 1,108 applications for the 45 places in the course, which means about 25 students are vying for every place. The demand for the new course has also led to a rise in total number of applications - 14,000 in all this year, a 6 per cent rise over last year. Earlier this year, when SMU announced the new course, its officials likened it to Oxford University's prestigious politics, philosophy and economics course. It is aimed at giving students a broad understanding of how the world works and will prepare them for a range of careers. Students who had applied for the course said it is an unusual combination since it includes the study of law with economics and politics - and prestigious to boot as it is being offered to only a select group of high-calibre students. Many were also drawn by the fact that the course would prepare them for a wide range of jobs, including in journalism, foreign affairs, public service, consulting and research. SMU provost Lily Kong said she was delighted with the response. She added: "From all our engagement sessions, it is clear that students, parents and employers recognise the value that the PLE combination of disciplines can bring in preparing graduates who can handle multifaceted careers... "Through a deeper understanding of how politics, law and economics intersect to shape the world in which we live, we hope to groom a new generation of leaders and thinkers for Singapore." The 45 students selected for the course will take all three subjects in the first year, before specialising in one of four areas - global studies, distribution and justice, public policy and governance, or choice and behaviour - from year two. Students will also have to go on a 10-week internship during which they will work on a project to find solutions to a real-world problem. SMU said several firms have indicated their interest in offering internships to those on the course. They include the Economic Development Board as well as consultancies like Bain and Company. SMU officials said close to 5,000 of the 14,000 applicants have been shortlisted so far. They will be further assessed via interviews. Professor Kong said that, besides academic results, SMU uses other criteria for admission. "Exam grades are a valid measure, but they cannot be the sole measure of a student's ability." The university is the first in Singapore to require all [shortlisted] candidates to attend an interview. It started the practice 16 years ago, when 2,000 students applied to become part of its pioneer batch. Interviews are still required now, although the number of candidates shortlisted for the six undergraduate degree courses has trebled. They are conducted individually or in groups, with professors on the lookout for intellectual curiosity and leadership qualities. SMU said a select group of students - about 1,000 - with strong academic and other abilities were invited to visit the university on "SMU Discovery Day" this year. Prof Kong said: "Our engagement is directed at confirming that they are indeed an excellent match for the education that SMU offers, and for them to confirm that SMU is the university of choice for them." A-level holder Benedict Lim, 20, who applied for the PLE course, said: "I have an interest in both (law and economics) and had a hard time picking one, so when I heard about SMU's new course, I jumped at the chance." He is keen on a broad-based education as he believes it will train him to be versatile and adaptable and enable him to switch careers. "You know what they say about students having to take on jobs that don't exist today. "I really do believe that. That's why it is best to have a broad-based education, so that you have a broad understanding of issues and how the world works." Probably an inflated nunber What they shld publish rather is the number of ppl putting that as their first choice at smu",13.256402618173077

Why didn't you apply for Humanities & Social Studies instead? [Probing CCAs & Interests -2] 5. Why do you still want to choose NTU instead of NUS? [Universities Choice -3] Below are just my opinions. The interview ended surprisingly faster than expected - far less than 10 minutes. However, there were no questions related to assess my competency for ACBS, and I guess that these questions are completely the same as single degree interview. Also, I doubt they even know what I actually applied for. So for those who are applying ACBS as well, do rest assure.  Comparing NTU and SMU, I find that NTU is more rigid in the way they conduct their interviews. They seem to have a list of standardized questions to be asked. Whereas for SMU, after I spoken about my attachment in one of the Big 4, the whole conversation was all about the work I did, and how I was able to cope with stress in the environment. Very friendly professors. As such, it is much easier to control your conversation topic for SMU. Again, in my opinion, NTU is more interested in how you can contribute to NTU. Whilst for SMU, the professors really want to know you as an individual. Also, the interviewers in NTU seem to be expressionless; it feels that I was talking to robots, but at the very least they did hold eye contact with me. Both are equally efficient in conducting their interviews nevertheless. Generally agree with Aomatsu.  Just to add on, I went for the ACBS interview back in 2014, because, you know, NS, and the main interviewer was Prof Valerie. We had a rather entertaining conversation and it was more of a chit-chat session than an interview. NTU knows what courses you applied for. She had my application form in hard copy on the table (in full view) and asked me why I applied for REP as my 2nd choice, and only put Accountancy (single degree) as the 3rd choice. Other than that, the main focus was definitely on how I would contribute NTU if they offered me a place/scholarship. Of course I talked about joining some clubs in NBS, my career goals and the various competitions/events at NTU which interest me. They didn't ask me those "essay" kind of questions though, but we chatted for around 20 minutes. It was a very light-hearted and enjoyable session and it felt really short in fact. After the interview, the prof invited me to apply for the USP. I also went for the SMU interview (also in 2014) for the double degree programme in Accountancy and Business. I remember being interviewed by Prof Seow and Prof Gary Pan. They seemed really concerned about whether I applied to NUS/NTU and asked me which I would pick if I was offered all 3. It somehow gave me the impression that they were being insecure/desperate. However, I liked the fact that they gave more attention to my hobbies and interests and focused less on academic achievements. I guess this is one example of SMU's holistic admissions process. They were also constantly marketing their school throughout the interview by asking me if I knew that their school of accountancy was ranked xxx in the BYU rankings etc, and kept comparing them to the other 2 unis. What I got out of that interview was that the profs at SMU are really passionate about what they do and that they're incredibly driven especially when it comes to building the school's reputation.  At the end of the day, both are local universities. Employers will lump NUS/NTU/SMU together anyway. So in terms of employability, no difference really. Choose the school which suits your personality better.",13.121194457416664
2016,Singapore Management University|smu,Republic Polytechnic|Republic poly|rp|computer|com|infosys|information systems|analytics,"SINGAPORE: Three of Singapore's autonomous universities are refining the way they admit students under the Discretionary Admissions Scheme, which looks beyond a person's academic achievements. It comes as the universities prepare to take in more students under the scheme, when the current cap of 10 per cent allowed for discretionary admissions goes up to 15 per cent next year. ADVERTISING inRead invented by Teads National University of Singapore (NUS) is offering 7,000 places for the coming academic year, but it has received four times the number of applicants. While it has started handing out offers to those who made the cut based on their grades, about 1,800 students who did not are undergoing interviews to be considered for discretionary admissions this year. NUS has been evaluating and admitting more students under the scheme over the years. Last year, it evaluated 1,600 students, 400 more than 2014. 670 of them got in, 70 more than 2014. With more students expected to be considered for discretionary admissions, the process at NUS may be refined. Said Professor Tan Eng Chye, deputy president of academic affairs at NUS: “We are evolving; for instance, we have gotten alumni to help us with the interviews. I find that very useful because the alumni have a lot of experience in sizing up people and candidates, and they ask very useful questions. “We also provide more data on what to look out for and if the numbers get to be big, we may decide that maybe we can have sort of a test first - not an academic test per se, but perhaps a test to look at other non-academic aspects of that person. It could be an aptitude test.” Prof Tan added: “Exercising flexibility is one aspect; you also have to be fairly sharp on what to look for - it is not simply: 'OK, meet the numbers.' Our interest is to look for attributes of the applicants that would make the student community more interesting, more diversified, and enhance the interaction within the student community. “Those who can adequately and can eloquently convey their passions and interests - that would be advantageous. But we also have to look out for students who may not be able to communicate as well, but yet they have the potential for us to groom them to be able graduates.” At the Singapore Management University (SMU), discretionary admissions currently form about 5 to 8 per cent of the annual intake. With the higher cap of 15 per cent for such admissions next year, the university will have "more leeway" when assessing students. Professor Pang Yang Hoong, vice provost for undergraduate matters and student development at SMU, said: “For SMU, looking at students with other qualifications is not something terribly new because we always been holistic in the way we assess students and their suitability for admission. We will be more flexible. “(We look for) passion, the aptitude for the course for which we are admitting them into. It would also be ideal if students have demonstrated that they are successful to be in time management, that they also possess resilience and the ability to overcome difficult situations. This will help us to assess if that person has got the resilience and the determination to do well in the programme.” SMU is expecting more polytechnic graduates to apply through the discretionary route with the cap being raised to 15 per cent of the annual intake. Nanyang Technological University (NTU) will also "broaden the criteria", to give more people a shot at securing a place. It will favourably consider those who possess "enthusiasm and relevant work experience". Professor Kam Chan Hin, senior associate provost for undergraduate education at NTU, commented: “Normally, they will look at other achievements that they have - whether in sports, in arts … or even if they are very passionate about community service, leadership. So these are the things that we usually look for. “We are going to encourage all the schools to broaden the criteria, to allow more people who have a very strong passion, to be given the opportunity to be interviewed. We should be more adventurous, open it a bit more and ask more questions, outside of the usual parameters, and if you find somebody who is really very interesting and very passionate … give them a chance.” NTU had evaluated 1,400 students under the scheme last year and about 600 were given a place. All three universities said that even as they exercise flexibility, it is still important for students to show that they possess the "adequate academic competence" to go through the rigour and demands of a university education.  - CNA/ms",13.119959051876242
2016,Singapore Management University|smu,Republic Polytechnic|Republic poly|rp|computer|com|infosys|information systems|analytics,"New SMU course: 1,108 vying for 45 placesCombination of politics, law and economics proves a winner; total number of applications up 6% to 14,000 Sandra Davie, Senior Education Correspondenthttp://www.straitstimes.com/singapor...-for-45-places A new degree course at Singapore Management University (SMU) which offers a combination of politics, law and economics (PLE) is a hit with young Singaporeans hoping to land a university place this year. SMU received 1,108 applications for the 45 places in the course, which means about 25 students are vying for every place. The demand for the new course has also led to a rise in total number of applications - 14,000 in all this year, a 6 per cent rise over last year. Earlier this year, when SMU announced the new course, its officials likened it to Oxford University's prestigious politics, philosophy and economics course. It is aimed at giving students a broad understanding of how the world works and will prepare them for a range of careers. Students who had applied for the course said it is an unusual combination since it includes the study of law with economics and politics - and prestigious to boot as it is being offered to only a select group of high-calibre students. Many were also drawn by the fact that the course would prepare them for a wide range of jobs, including in journalism, foreign affairs, public service, consulting and research. SMU provost Lily Kong said she was delighted with the response. She added: "From all our engagement sessions, it is clear that students, parents and employers recognise the value that the PLE combination of disciplines can bring in preparing graduates who can handle multifaceted careers... "Through a deeper understanding of how politics, law and economics intersect to shape the world in which we live, we hope to groom a new generation of leaders and thinkers for Singapore." The 45 students selected for the course will take all three subjects in the first year, before specialising in one of four areas - global studies, distribution and justice, public policy and governance, or choice and behaviour - from year two. Students will also have to go on a 10-week internship during which they will work on a project to find solutions to a real-world problem. SMU said several firms have indicated their interest in offering internships to those on the course. They include the Economic Development Board as well as consultancies like Bain and Company. SMU officials said close to 5,000 of the 14,000 applicants have been shortlisted so far. They will be further assessed via interviews. Professor Kong said that, besides academic results, SMU uses other criteria for admission. "Exam grades are a valid measure, but they cannot be the sole measure of a student's ability." The university is the first in Singapore to require all [shortlisted] candidates to attend an interview. It started the practice 16 years ago, when 2,000 students applied to become part of its pioneer batch. Interviews are still required now, although the number of candidates shortlisted for the six undergraduate degree courses has trebled. They are conducted individually or in groups, with professors on the lookout for intellectual curiosity and leadership qualities. SMU said a select group of students - about 1,000 - with strong academic and other abilities were invited to visit the university on "SMU Discovery Day" this year. Prof Kong said: "Our engagement is directed at confirming that they are indeed an excellent match for the education that SMU offers, and for them to confirm that SMU is the university of choice for them." A-level holder Benedict Lim, 20, who applied for the PLE course, said: "I have an interest in both (law and economics) and had a hard time picking one, so when I heard about SMU's new course, I jumped at the chance." He is keen on a broad-based education as he believes it will train him to be versatile and adaptable and enable him to switch careers. "You know what they say about students having to take on jobs that don't exist today. "I really do believe that. That's why it is best to have a broad-based education, so that you have a broad understanding of issues and how the world works."",12.994491356350345

2016,Singapore Management University|smu,Singapore polytechnic|singapore poly|sp|computer|com|infosys|information systems|analytics,"Which university? Which course of study?Aim for a course that best suits you, rather than enrol in the most lucrative one Tan Eng Chye Prof Tan is deputy president (academic affairs) and provost at the National University of Singapore. PUBLISHED 6 HOURS AGOhttp://www.straitstimes.com/singapor...ourse-of-study The university admissions season is in full swing, and this is an exciting time for students in Singapore. The tertiary education landscape here has expanded significantly, and there are now many varied and interesting pathways for students to choose from, from traditional professional degree courses in medicine or engineering, to music and the liberal arts and science. Many parents I met at the National University of Singapore's (NUS) Open Day last month remarked that they are envious of the plethora of choices their children have, and wish to be young once more. Some of you may have secured multiple offers from different universities in Singapore and overseas, and you will have to make an acceptance decision soon. But how should one decide? Every year, the Ministry of Education publishes the employment rates and median starting salaries of fresh graduates of the different degree programmes offered by local universities. I certainly hope students do not make decisions based solely on data obtained through the Graduate Employment Survey (GES). GES data provides an indication of starting salaries. Starting salaries are but a guide; they neither set the course nor determine one's career trajectory or destiny. In this volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous or "Vuca" world, one cannot predict the future or where the lucrative jobs will be. You would therefore want your university education to equip you with broad-based life skills, and develop you with the flexibility and resilience needed to pick up new knowledge, adapt to new circumstances, and exploit job opportunities across a variety of sectors throughout your lifetime of careers. Another consideration is whether and how the university course adds value to your educational journey. Some students (and parents) may look to university rankings as a measure of the strength of a university department. And there are definitely synergies between research and education. If the university department excels in research, and counts world-leading researchers in the field, it is likely that cutting-edge research will filter through to your learning experience. You will have the opportunity to be taught by highly regarded academics, and there will be plenty of opportunities to conduct research under the who's-who in the field. This is particularly valuable if you have a very strong interest in research or academia. Choosing a university that excels in your area of interest may also open up more specialised opportunities, such as advanced facilities, academic opportunities such as overseas study or research trips, as well as internships and employment opportunities with prestigious organisations in the industry. Beyond academic reputation, your choice of university will also affect your life intellectually, socially and professionally. You should evaluate the entire student experience, and whether it will suit you. Find out if the social setting on campus is what you would want to be part of. NUS has, for example, the Yale-NUS College and the University Town Residential College programmes, which offer an integrated living and learning experience, amid a collegial and intellectually vibrant setting. Another distinctive programme is the NUS Overseas Colleges programme, where students get to live, work and study in an entrepreneurial hub such as Silicon Valley, New York City or Stockholm, taking entrepreneurship classes at a partner university while working in promising entrepreneurial start-ups. All universities have carefully developed their own suite of programmes and it is worth your time and effort to find out what is on offer. Talk to the professors, and to current students. Universities hold Open Days and various outreach sessions where you can visit the campus and get first-hand information. The best-ranked university or the programme that offers you two degrees in the shortest duration may sound attractive, but they may not necessarily be what you are looking for.  Some of you may want an intensely academic experience, and to pick up as many degrees in the shortest possible time. Yet others may prefer to develop a broader range of capabilities, to try out new things, or to pursue more varied experiences. You should aim to identify a university and a course that best suits you, and not simply enrol in the most competitive or lucrative course. After all, you will be spending your next three to four years in this programme. For those of you whose grades may not meet the degree programme's published entry requirements, do not give up. All local universities have discretionary admissions schemes. Last year, NUS interviewed a record 1,600 students under the scheme, and admitted 670 students. This scheme allows universities to assess applicants more holistically, and to consider their passions and attributes such as leadership, resilience or entrepreneurial skills or talent in non-academic areas. The good news is that from the next academic year onwards, NUS, Nanyang Technological University and Singapore Management University can take in more students under the Discretionary Admissions Scheme, from 10 per cent of the annual intake currently, to up to 15 per cent. This will enable more students to enter universities on the basis of their strengths and talents, beyond academic performance. There is no perfect university. What is key is to make a considered decision with the resources and information that are available to you. Your degree should help start you on the journey to where you want to go. The knowledge, experiences and opportunities in your university life should also prepare you for life beyond your degree. As a student in Singapore, you will have up to the beginning of June to decide on your offers from most of the local universities. Whatever you eventually decide on, make the most of your university experience because, for many, it will be the best time of your life.",14.866131243090694

I was hoping to get some advice from you guys here. Firstly, Congrats to all those who have successful applications. To those who are still waiting, or got rejected, don't feel despair, i'm pretty sure you'll find your way out. Like a professional juggler once told me, his biggest lesson in juggling isn't any particular technically-advanced sleights, but this: "When the ball drops, pick it up." Simple, but means a lot. Now, my story: I am from the '94 batch. Took my A levels in 2012, flunk it really badly, because I was heavily distracted by relationship issues (broke up with my ex, which caused a whole landslide trail of problems. But that's another whole long story, and besides the point). I barely studied during A levels then, and entered the exam hall hoping to fail. But miraculously, i scraped through it, and wasn't allowed to retain in JC. The resultant problem: Straight C result, with one S grade. Devastatingly embarrassing, and was a crushing defeat. You see, I come from an IP school, and that technically means that, should I flunk my A levels, all i'm equivalent of is a Primary 6 standard. So here I am, half of my life, effectively erased on papers. I gone on to enlist in NS, and kept my report card hidden away in the "shameful" corner of my room, collecting dust. After NS, i decided to take a break, took a gap year, all these while, casting aside any thoughts on studies and the education system. I went on to completing 1 internship, and 2 other jobs, as well as backpacking around Europe, South East Asia and Australia. It was fulfilling, and definitely a worthwhile experience. But now, 3 years after receiving my poor A levels result, I finally decided to get back on to the system, and apply for university. Expectedly, even with DA (I was a former national athlete, and I had my employers write in recommendation letters), I was sorrowfully rejected. This time, it hit me hard, after all these years of "escaping", I was finally facing the music, and there and then i knew I had to do sth with my life to move on.TL;DR: I still want to enter university. I know i can do better than that "shitty" result i've got. So here's what I came for, hoping for someone to offer me some advice. Personally, I am contemplating on retaking A levels. My previous subject combination was PMEE. I know my science practical grades could no longer be used, so i have to go to a private institution to do it. I am considering going to MDIS and follow its system. (Question, does anybody have any experience or knowledge or advice on MDIS? Is it a good choice for me?) On top of that, I am intending on going for private tuition to brush up my skills, because i've heard that MDIS tutors aren't the best, or at least they aren't as good as JC MOE teachers. (So, does anybody know of any good 1-to-1 tutors, that could give you undivided attention?) Lastly, is anybody here intending to repeat A levels, I was hoping to form a study group of a couple students, and mug together, and we could encourage one another. This is my one shot, i'm giving my all, and keeping my head in the game. Thank you for reading, hope to get some responses. Really sorry to learn of your predicament. Im in a same situation as u, also from ip. Registration for re taking a levels this year as private candidate has alrdy ended. Have u tried applying to private unis such as sim? Im still waiting for smu and sim to get back to me. If all else fails, maybe we can retake together! If thats the case, i might change my combi to science instead of arts haha",14.422636554805836
2016,Singapore Management University|smu,Singapore polytechnic|singapore poly|sp|computer|com|infosys|information systems|analytics,"DISCLAIMER: I'd like to say that this post is not meant to flame anyone or put a negative spotlight on anyone. The examples I highlighted below are simply the comments/questions that I spotted which inspired me to write this. I wouldn't want to start a discussion about education in Singapore here, nor would this a debate for JC vs Poly. Just a little background about myself - I was a comms student in poly, did pretty average for my GPA (3.5x), missed the uni application in my first year of army, got rejected by NTU ADM last year, finally got a late acceptance letter from ADM this year. So trust me when I say I can empathise with those who are still waiting for their acceptance letter, and why some people are asking certain questions here.Spoiler!Hi guys, care to give your opinions and views on SMU Business VS NUS Statistics?  Which one will have higher demand by employers? The answer to this is simple, ask yourself where do you want to work? MNC? Local startup? The big 4? Starting your own business? Government sector? The 'value' of a degree is only given to by the people looking at it. Even then, there are those companies in each category that would defy the stereotypical hiring policy. So my advice to the poster who asked this question is to define who are your said 'employers' first. If you have no idea where you want to work or which sector of business you want to be in, it might serve you better to understand more about the course to see which specific programme/school/school culture might suit you better rather which degree appeals more to 'employers'. It's better to make an informed choice yourself.Spoiler!Actually, people do look at where you study. I got a couple of friends in HR. They told me that they would also look at the university, course, GPA/grades, modules taken, then any leadership roles regardless of how many years of relevant work experience a person has. Some say they tend to give more priority to old boys/girls, alum, that sort of thing. I'm not saying you're wrong here buddy, and in fact you're correct in saying this! But like I mentioned previously, it depends on where you're applying for work at, what is the company's hiring policy, what are they looking for etc. Comments like this might mislead some to think that this one degree/choice of school will make or break their future. What your friends experienced are the hiring policies of their particular companies they work at, but it's definitely not the same across various companies.There's no 'one size fits all' answer to certain questions. There is also no 'only one single path' to success. Some students don't realise it yet. This is the point that I'm driving at - Students should not be afraid to seek out multiple answers to a single question. There is always more than one way to solve a single question. Isn't that how it is for Math too? There may be one solution given in the answer book but it doesn't mean that that's the only one.If you do not get your university placing in the public schools this year, there are many other options! For poly students, you can take a gap year and work first, try again next year or the year after, like what I was planning to do myself should I not get my placing this year. Work experience ain't a bad idea too. For JC students, you can always take the A's again (like what some here are planning to do), to get a better grade for your dream course on the next application. I had a friend who couldn't get pharmaceutical, retook his A's while serving NS, scored a much better grade and went on to pharmaceutical on a scholarship in the end. If you really want to study this year, then private schools might be a viable idea as well. Yes things might not have gone according to plan for you. You might have been taught your whole life that you must get into NTU/NUS/SMU, or that might have been pressure on yourself. But fact is, if you're not getting in (even after appeal), then it's on you to take your next step forward. You have to keep moving forward in life despite the obstacles you face. If you're really rejected in the end, allow yourself to be sad for a little while, then pick yourself up, make plans, take the next step forward and move on. You might have to take a little detour, but it doesn't mean you can't get there. It's just how badly you want it. I hope this lengthy post written at 3am in the morning would encourage some of you even a little, because I know what it's like to constantly fail at every turn and have life keep pushing you down. If it did, then I'm glad. ",13.924120523852473

SMU said a select group of students - about 1,000 - with strong academic and other abilities were invited to visit the university on "SMU Discovery Day" this year. Prof Kong said: "Our engagement is directed at confirming that they are indeed an excellent match for the education that SMU offers, and for them to confirm that SMU is the university of choice for them." A-level holder Benedict Lim, 20, who applied for the PLE course, said: "I have an interest in both (law and economics) and had a hard time picking one, so when I heard about SMU's new course, I jumped at the chance." He is keen on a broad-based education as he believes it will train him to be versatile and adaptable and enable him to switch careers.

Why didn't you apply for Humanities & Social Studies instead? [Probing CCAs & Interests -2] 5. Why do you still want to choose NTU instead of NUS? [Universities Choice -3] Below are just my opinions. The interview ended surprisingly faster than expected - far less than 10 minutes. However, there were no questions related to assess my competency for ACBS, and I guess that these questions are completely the same as single degree interview. Also, I doubt they even know what I actually applied for. So for those who are applying ACBS as well, do rest assure.  Comparing NTU and SMU, I find that NTU is more rigid in the way they conduct their interviews. They seem to have a list of standardized questions to be asked. Whereas for SMU, after I spoken about my attachment in one of the Big 4, the whole conversation was all about the work I did, and how I was able to cope with stress in the environment. Very friendly professors. As such, it is much easier to control your conversation topic for SMU. Again, in my opinion, NTU is more interested in how you can contribute to NTU. Whilst for SMU, the professors really want to know you as an individual. Also, the interviewers in NTU seem to be expressionless; it feels that I was talking to robots, but at the very least they did hold eye contact with me. Both are equally efficient in conducting their interviews nevertheless. Generally agree with Aomatsu.  Just to add on, I went for the ACBS interview back in 2014, because, you know, NS, and the main interviewer was Prof Valerie. We had a rather entertaining conversation and it was more of a chit-chat session than an interview. NTU knows what courses you applied for. She had my application form in hard copy on the table (in full view) and asked me why I applied for REP as my 2nd choice, and only put Accountancy (single degree) as the 3rd choice. Other than that, the main focus was definitely on how I would contribute NTU if they offered me a place/scholarship. Of course I talked about joining some clubs in NBS, my career goals and the various competitions/events at NTU which interest me. They didn't ask me those "essay" kind of questions though, but we chatted for around 20 minutes. It was a very light-hearted and enjoyable session and it felt really short in fact. After the interview, the prof invited me to apply for the USP. I also went for the SMU interview (also in 2014) for the double degree programme in Accountancy and Business. I remember being interviewed by Prof Seow and Prof Gary Pan. They seemed really concerned about whether I applied to NUS/NTU and asked me which I would pick if I was offered all 3. It somehow gave me the impression that they were being insecure/desperate. However, I liked the fact that they gave more attention to my hobbies and interests and focused less on academic achievements. I guess this is one example of SMU's holistic admissions process. They were also constantly marketing their school throughout the interview by asking me if I knew that their school of accountancy was ranked xxx in the BYU rankings etc, and kept comparing them to the other 2 unis. What I got out of that interview was that the profs at SMU are really passionate about what they do and that they're incredibly driven especially when it comes to building the school's reputation.  At the end of the day, both are local universities. Employers will lump NUS/NTU/SMU together anyway. So in terms of employability, no difference really. Choose the school which suits your personality better.",13.192633729958231
2016,Singapore Management University|smu,Singapore polytechnic|singapore poly|sp|computer|com|infosys|information systems|analytics,"SINGAPORE: Three of Singapore's autonomous universities are refining the way they admit students under the Discretionary Admissions Scheme, which looks beyond a person's academic achievements. It comes as the universities prepare to take in more students under the scheme, when the current cap of 10 per cent allowed for discretionary admissions goes up to 15 per cent next year. ADVERTISING inRead invented by Teads National University of Singapore (NUS) is offering 7,000 places for the coming academic year, but it has received four times the number of applicants. While it has started handing out offers to those who made the cut based on their grades, about 1,800 students who did not are undergoing interviews to be considered for discretionary admissions this year. NUS has been evaluating and admitting more students under the scheme over the years. Last year, it evaluated 1,600 students, 400 more than 2014. 670 of them got in, 70 more than 2014. With more students expected to be considered for discretionary admissions, the process at NUS may be refined. Said Professor Tan Eng Chye, deputy president of academic affairs at NUS: “We are evolving; for instance, we have gotten alumni to help us with the interviews. I find that very useful because the alumni have a lot of experience in sizing up people and candidates, and they ask very useful questions. “We also provide more data on what to look out for and if the numbers get to be big, we may decide that maybe we can have sort of a test first - not an academic test per se, but perhaps a test to look at other non-academic aspects of that person. It could be an aptitude test.” Prof Tan added: “Exercising flexibility is one aspect; you also have to be fairly sharp on what to look for - it is not simply: 'OK, meet the numbers.' Our interest is to look for attributes of the applicants that would make the student community more interesting, more diversified, and enhance the interaction within the student community. “Those who can adequately and can eloquently convey their passions and interests - that would be advantageous. But we also have to look out for students who may not be able to communicate as well, but yet they have the potential for us to groom them to be able graduates.” At the Singapore Management University (SMU), discretionary admissions currently form about 5 to 8 per cent of the annual intake. With the higher cap of 15 per cent for such admissions next year, the university will have "more leeway" when assessing students. Professor Pang Yang Hoong, vice provost for undergraduate matters and student development at SMU, said: “For SMU, looking at students with other qualifications is not something terribly new because we always been holistic in the way we assess students and their suitability for admission. We will be more flexible. “(We look for) passion, the aptitude for the course for which we are admitting them into. It would also be ideal if students have demonstrated that they are successful to be in time management, that they also possess resilience and the ability to overcome difficult situations. This will help us to assess if that person has got the resilience and the determination to do well in the programme.” SMU is expecting more polytechnic graduates to apply through the discretionary route with the cap being raised to 15 per cent of the annual intake. Nanyang Technological University (NTU) will also "broaden the criteria", to give more people a shot at securing a place. It will favourably consider those who possess "enthusiasm and relevant work experience". Professor Kam Chan Hin, senior associate provost for undergraduate education at NTU, commented: “Normally, they will look at other achievements that they have - whether in sports, in arts … or even if they are very passionate about community service, leadership. So these are the things that we usually look for. “We are going to encourage all the schools to broaden the criteria, to allow more people who have a very strong passion, to be given the opportunity to be interviewed. We should be more adventurous, open it a bit more and ask more questions, outside of the usual parameters, and if you find somebody who is really very interesting and very passionate … give them a chance.” NTU had evaluated 1,400 students under the scheme last year and about 600 were given a place. All three universities said that even as they exercise flexibility, it is still important for students to show that they possess the "adequate academic competence" to go through the rigour and demands of a university education.  - CNA/ms",13.140061810370772
2016,Singapore Management University|smu,Singapore polytechnic|singapore poly|sp|computer|com|infosys|information systems|analytics,"New SMU course: 1,108 vying for 45 placesCombination of politics, law and economics proves a winner; total number of applications up 6% to 14,000 Sandra Davie, Senior Education Correspondenthttp://www.straitstimes.com/singapor...-for-45-places A new degree course at Singapore Management University (SMU) which offers a combination of politics, law and economics (PLE) is a hit with young Singaporeans hoping to land a university place this year. SMU received 1,108 applications for the 45 places in the course, which means about 25 students are vying for every place. The demand for the new course has also led to a rise in total number of applications - 14,000 in all this year, a 6 per cent rise over last year. Earlier this year, when SMU announced the new course, its officials likened it to Oxford University's prestigious politics, philosophy and economics course. It is aimed at giving students a broad understanding of how the world works and will prepare them for a range of careers. Students who had applied for the course said it is an unusual combination since it includes the study of law with economics and politics - and prestigious to boot as it is being offered to only a select group of high-calibre students. Many were also drawn by the fact that the course would prepare them for a wide range of jobs, including in journalism, foreign affairs, public service, consulting and research. SMU provost Lily Kong said she was delighted with the response. She added: "From all our engagement sessions, it is clear that students, parents and employers recognise the value that the PLE combination of disciplines can bring in preparing graduates who can handle multifaceted careers... "Through a deeper understanding of how politics, law and economics intersect to shape the world in which we live, we hope to groom a new generation of leaders and thinkers for Singapore." The 45 students selected for the course will take all three subjects in the first year, before specialising in one of four areas - global studies, distribution and justice, public policy and governance, or choice and behaviour - from year two. Students will also have to go on a 10-week internship during which they will work on a project to find solutions to a real-world problem. SMU said several firms have indicated their interest in offering internships to those on the course. They include the Economic Development Board as well as consultancies like Bain and Company. SMU officials said close to 5,000 of the 14,000 applicants have been shortlisted so far. They will be further assessed via interviews. Professor Kong said that, besides academic results, SMU uses other criteria for admission. "Exam grades are a valid measure, but they cannot be the sole measure of a student's ability." The university is the first in Singapore to require all [shortlisted] candidates to attend an interview. It started the practice 16 years ago, when 2,000 students applied to become part of its pioneer batch. Interviews are still required now, although the number of candidates shortlisted for the six undergraduate degree courses has trebled. They are conducted individually or in groups, with professors on the lookout for intellectual curiosity and leadership qualities. SMU said a select group of students - about 1,000 - with strong academic and other abilities were invited to visit the university on "SMU Discovery Day" this year.

2016,Singapore Management University|smu,ngee ann polytechnic|ngee ann poly|np|computer|com|infosys|information systems|analytics,"Which university? Which course of study?Aim for a course that best suits you, rather than enrol in the most lucrative one Tan Eng Chye Prof Tan is deputy president (academic affairs) and provost at the National University of Singapore. PUBLISHED 6 HOURS AGOhttp://www.straitstimes.com/singapor...ourse-of-study The university admissions season is in full swing, and this is an exciting time for students in Singapore. The tertiary education landscape here has expanded significantly, and there are now many varied and interesting pathways for students to choose from, from traditional professional degree courses in medicine or engineering, to music and the liberal arts and science. Many parents I met at the National University of Singapore's (NUS) Open Day last month remarked that they are envious of the plethora of choices their children have, and wish to be young once more. Some of you may have secured multiple offers from different universities in Singapore and overseas, and you will have to make an acceptance decision soon. But how should one decide? Every year, the Ministry of Education publishes the employment rates and median starting salaries of fresh graduates of the different degree programmes offered by local universities. I certainly hope students do not make decisions based solely on data obtained through the Graduate Employment Survey (GES). GES data provides an indication of starting salaries. Starting salaries are but a guide; they neither set the course nor determine one's career trajectory or destiny. In this volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous or "Vuca" world, one cannot predict the future or where the lucrative jobs will be. You would therefore want your university education to equip you with broad-based life skills, and develop you with the flexibility and resilience needed to pick up new knowledge, adapt to new circumstances, and exploit job opportunities across a variety of sectors throughout your lifetime of careers. Another consideration is whether and how the university course adds value to your educational journey. Some students (and parents) may look to university rankings as a measure of the strength of a university department. And there are definitely synergies between research and education. If the university department excels in research, and counts world-leading researchers in the field, it is likely that cutting-edge research will filter through to your learning experience. You will have the opportunity to be taught by highly regarded academics, and there will be plenty of opportunities to conduct research under the who's-who in the field. This is particularly valuable if you have a very strong interest in research or academia. Choosing a university that excels in your area of interest may also open up more specialised opportunities, such as advanced facilities, academic opportunities such as overseas study or research trips, as well as internships and employment opportunities with prestigious organisations in the industry. Beyond academic reputation, your choice of university will also affect your life intellectually, socially and professionally. You should evaluate the entire student experience, and whether it will suit you. Find out if the social setting on campus is what you would want to be part of. NUS has, for example, the Yale-NUS College and the University Town Residential College programmes, which offer an integrated living and learning experience, amid a collegial and intellectually vibrant setting. Another distinctive programme is the NUS Overseas Colleges programme, where students get to live, work and study in an entrepreneurial hub such as Silicon Valley, New York City or Stockholm, taking entrepreneurship classes at a partner university while working in promising entrepreneurial start-ups. All universities have carefully developed their own suite of programmes and it is worth your time and effort to find out what is on offer. Talk to the professors, and to current students. Universities hold Open Days and various outreach sessions where you can visit the campus and get first-hand information. The best-ranked university or the programme that offers you two degrees in the shortest duration may sound attractive, but they may not necessarily be what you are looking for.  Some of you may want an intensely academic experience, and to pick up as many degrees in the shortest possible time. Yet others may prefer to develop a broader range of capabilities, to try out new things, or to pursue more varied experiences. You should aim to identify a university and a course that best suits you, and not simply enrol in the most competitive or lucrative course. After all, you will be spending your next three to four years in this programme. For those of you whose grades may not meet the degree programme's published entry requirements, do not give up. All local universities have discretionary admissions schemes. Last year, NUS interviewed a record 1,600 students under the scheme, and admitted 670 students. This scheme allows universities to assess applicants more holistically, and to consider their passions and attributes such as leadership, resilience or entrepreneurial skills or talent in non-academic areas. The good news is that from the next academic year onwards, NUS, Nanyang Technological University and Singapore Management University can take in more students under the Discretionary Admissions Scheme, from 10 per cent of the annual intake currently, to up to 15 per cent. This will enable more students to enter universities on the basis of their strengths and talents, beyond academic performance. There is no perfect university. What is key is to make a considered decision with the resources and information that are available to you. Your degree should help start you on the journey to where you want to go. The knowledge, experiences and opportunities in your university life should also prepare you for life beyond your degree. As a student in Singapore, you will have up to the beginning of June to decide on your offers from most of the local universities. Whatever you eventually decide on, make the most of your university experience because, for many, it will be the best time of your life.",14.84956063840559

I was hoping to get some advice from you guys here. Firstly, Congrats to all those who have successful applications. To those who are still waiting, or got rejected, don't feel despair, i'm pretty sure you'll find your way out. Like a professional juggler once told me, his biggest lesson in juggling isn't any particular technically-advanced sleights, but this: "When the ball drops, pick it up." Simple, but means a lot. Now, my story: I am from the '94 batch. Took my A levels in 2012, flunk it really badly, because I was heavily distracted by relationship issues (broke up with my ex, which caused a whole landslide trail of problems. But that's another whole long story, and besides the point). I barely studied during A levels then, and entered the exam hall hoping to fail. But miraculously, i scraped through it, and wasn't allowed to retain in JC. The resultant problem: Straight C result, with one S grade. Devastatingly embarrassing, and was a crushing defeat. You see, I come from an IP school, and that technically means that, should I flunk my A levels, all i'm equivalent of is a Primary 6 standard. So here I am, half of my life, effectively erased on papers. I gone on to enlist in NS, and kept my report card hidden away in the "shameful" corner of my room, collecting dust. After NS, i decided to take a break, took a gap year, all these while, casting aside any thoughts on studies and the education system. I went on to completing 1 internship, and 2 other jobs, as well as backpacking around Europe, South East Asia and Australia. It was fulfilling, and definitely a worthwhile experience. But now, 3 years after receiving my poor A levels result, I finally decided to get back on to the system, and apply for university. Expectedly, even with DA (I was a former national athlete, and I had my employers write in recommendation letters), I was sorrowfully rejected. This time, it hit me hard, after all these years of "escaping", I was finally facing the music, and there and then i knew I had to do sth with my life to move on.TL;DR: I still want to enter university. I know i can do better than that "shitty" result i've got. So here's what I came for, hoping for someone to offer me some advice. Personally, I am contemplating on retaking A levels. My previous subject combination was PMEE. I know my science practical grades could no longer be used, so i have to go to a private institution to do it. I am considering going to MDIS and follow its system. (Question, does anybody have any experience or knowledge or advice on MDIS? Is it a good choice for me?) On top of that, I am intending on going for private tuition to brush up my skills, because i've heard that MDIS tutors aren't the best, or at least they aren't as good as JC MOE teachers. (So, does anybody know of any good 1-to-1 tutors, that could give you undivided attention?) Lastly, is anybody here intending to repeat A levels, I was hoping to form a study group of a couple students, and mug together, and we could encourage one another. This is my one shot, i'm giving my all, and keeping my head in the game. Thank you for reading, hope to get some responses. Really sorry to learn of your predicament. Im in a same situation as u, also from ip. Registration for re taking a levels this year as private candidate has alrdy ended. Have u tried applying to private unis such as sim? Im still waiting for smu and sim to get back to me. If all else fails, maybe we can retake together! If thats the case, i might change my combi to science instead of arts haha",14.397813688063875

The examples I highlighted below are simply the comments/questions that I spotted which inspired me to write this. I wouldn't want to start a discussion about education in Singapore here, nor would this a debate for JC vs Poly. Just a little background about myself - I was a comms student in poly, did pretty average for my GPA (3.5x), missed the uni application in my first year of army, got rejected by NTU ADM last year, finally got a late acceptance letter from ADM this year. So trust me when I say I can empathise with those who are still waiting for their acceptance letter, and why some people are asking certain questions here.Spoiler!Hi guys, care to give your opinions and views on SMU Business VS NUS Statistics?  Which one will have higher demand by employers? The answer to this is simple, ask yourself where do you want to work? MNC? Local startup? The big 4? Starting your own business? Government sector? The 'value' of a degree is only given to by the people looking at it. Even then, there are those companies in each category that would defy the stereotypical hiring policy. So my advice to the poster who asked this question is to define who are your said 'employers' first. If you have no idea where you want to work or which sector of business you want to be in, it might serve you better to understand more about the course to see which specific programme/school/school culture might suit you better rather which degree appeals more to 'employers'. It's better to make an informed choice yourself.Spoiler!Actually, people do look at where you study. I got a couple of friends in HR. They told me that they would also look at the university, course, GPA/grades, modules taken, then any leadership roles regardless of how many years of relevant work experience a person has. Some say they tend to give more priority to old boys/girls, alum, that sort of thing. I'm not saying you're wrong here buddy, and in fact you're correct in saying this! But like I mentioned previously, it depends on where you're applying for work at, what is the company's hiring policy, what are they looking for etc. Comments like this might mislead some to think that this one degree/choice of school will make or break their future. What your friends experienced are the hiring policies of their particular companies they work at, but it's definitely not the same across various companies.There's no 'one size fits all' answer to certain questions. There is also no 'only one single path' to success. Some students don't realise it yet. This is the point that I'm driving at - Students should not be afraid to seek out multiple answers to a single question. There is always more than one way to solve a single question. Isn't that how it is for Math too? There may be one solution given in the answer book but it doesn't mean that that's the only one.If you do not get your university placing in the public schools this year, there are many other options! For poly students, you can take a gap year and work first, try again next year or the year after, like what I was planning to do myself should I not get my placing this year. Work experience ain't a bad idea too. For JC students, you can always take the A's again (like what some here are planning to do), to get a better grade for your dream course on the next application. I had a friend who couldn't get pharmaceutical, retook his A's while serving NS, scored a much better grade and went on to pharmaceutical on a scholarship in the end. If you really want to study this year, then private schools might be a viable idea as well. Yes things might not have gone according to plan for you. You might have been taught your whole life that you must get into NTU/NUS/SMU, or that might have been pressure on yourself. But fact is, if you're not getting in (even after appeal), then it's on you to take your next step forward. You have to keep moving forward in life despite the obstacles you face. If you're really rejected in the end, allow yourself to be sad for a little while, then pick yourself up, make plans, take the next step forward and move on. You might have to take a little detour, but it doesn't mean you can't get there. It's just how badly you want it. I hope this lengthy post written at 3am in the morning would encourage some of you even a little, because I know what it's like to constantly fail at every turn and have life keep pushing you down. If it did, then I'm glad. ",13.931070711959032

SMU received 1,108 applications for the 45 places in the course, which means about 25 students are vying for every place. The demand for the new course has also led to a rise in total number of applications - 14,000 in all this year, a 6 per cent rise over last year. Earlier this year, when SMU announced the new course, its officials likened it to Oxford University's prestigious politics, philosophy and economics course. It is aimed at giving students a broad understanding of how the world works and will prepare them for a range of careers. Students who had applied for the course said it is an unusual combination since it includes the study of law with economics and politics - and prestigious to boot as it is being offered to only a select group of high-calibre students. Many were also drawn by the fact that the course would prepare them for a wide range of jobs, including in journalism, foreign affairs, public service, consulting and research. SMU provost Lily Kong said she was delighted with the response. She added: "From all our engagement sessions, it is clear that students, parents and employers recognise the value that the PLE combination of disciplines can bring in preparing graduates who can handle multifaceted careers... "Through a deeper understanding of how politics, law and economics intersect to shape the world in which we live, we hope to groom a new generation of leaders and thinkers for Singapore." The 45 students selected for the course will take all three subjects in the first year, before specialising in one of four areas - global studies, distribution and justice, public policy and governance, or choice and behaviour - from year two. Students will also have to go on a 10-week internship during which they will work on a project to find solutions to a real-world problem. SMU said several firms have indicated their interest in offering internships to those on the course. They include the Economic Development Board as well as consultancies like Bain and Company. SMU officials said close to 5,000 of the 14,000 applicants have been shortlisted so far. They will be further assessed via interviews. Professor Kong said that, besides academic results, SMU uses other criteria for admission. "Exam grades are a valid measure, but they cannot be the sole measure of a student's ability." The university is the first in Singapore to require all [shortlisted] candidates to attend an interview. It started the practice 16 years ago, when 2,000 students applied to become part of its pioneer batch. Interviews are still required now, although the number of candidates shortlisted for the six undergraduate degree courses has trebled. They are conducted individually or in groups, with professors on the lookout for intellectual curiosity and leadership qualities. SMU said a select group of students - about 1,000 - with strong academic and other abilities were invited to visit the university on "SMU Discovery Day" this year. Prof Kong said: "Our engagement is directed at confirming that they are indeed an excellent match for the education that SMU offers, and for them to confirm that SMU is the university of choice for them." A-level holder Benedict Lim, 20, who applied for the PLE course, said: "I have an interest in both (law and economics) and had a hard time picking one, so when I heard about SMU's new course, I jumped at the chance." He is keen on a broad-based education as he believes it will train him to be versatile and adaptable and enable him to switch careers. "You know what they say about students having to take on jobs that don't exist today. "I really do believe that. That's why it is best to have a broad-based education, so that you have a broad understanding of issues and how the world works." Probably an inflated nunber What they shld publish rather is the number of ppl putting that as their first choice at smu",13.251667755437703

Why didn't you apply for Humanities & Social Studies instead? [Probing CCAs & Interests -2] 5. Why do you still want to choose NTU instead of NUS? [Universities Choice -3] Below are just my opinions. The interview ended surprisingly faster than expected - far less than 10 minutes. However, there were no questions related to assess my competency for ACBS, and I guess that these questions are completely the same as single degree interview. Also, I doubt they even know what I actually applied for. So for those who are applying ACBS as well, do rest assure.  Comparing NTU and SMU, I find that NTU is more rigid in the way they conduct their interviews. They seem to have a list of standardized questions to be asked. Whereas for SMU, after I spoken about my attachment in one of the Big 4, the whole conversation was all about the work I did, and how I was able to cope with stress in the environment. Very friendly professors. As such, it is much easier to control your conversation topic for SMU. Again, in my opinion, NTU is more interested in how you can contribute to NTU. Whilst for SMU, the professors really want to know you as an individual. Also, the interviewers in NTU seem to be expressionless; it feels that I was talking to robots, but at the very least they did hold eye contact with me. Both are equally efficient in conducting their interviews nevertheless. Generally agree with Aomatsu.  Just to add on, I went for the ACBS interview back in 2014, because, you know, NS, and the main interviewer was Prof Valerie. We had a rather entertaining conversation and it was more of a chit-chat session than an interview. NTU knows what courses you applied for. She had my application form in hard copy on the table (in full view) and asked me why I applied for REP as my 2nd choice, and only put Accountancy (single degree) as the 3rd choice. Other than that, the main focus was definitely on how I would contribute NTU if they offered me a place/scholarship. Of course I talked about joining some clubs in NBS, my career goals and the various competitions/events at NTU which interest me. They didn't ask me those "essay" kind of questions though, but we chatted for around 20 minutes. It was a very light-hearted and enjoyable session and it felt really short in fact. After the interview, the prof invited me to apply for the USP. I also went for the SMU interview (also in 2014) for the double degree programme in Accountancy and Business. I remember being interviewed by Prof Seow and Prof Gary Pan. They seemed really concerned about whether I applied to NUS/NTU and asked me which I would pick if I was offered all 3. It somehow gave me the impression that they were being insecure/desperate. However, I liked the fact that they gave more attention to my hobbies and interests and focused less on academic achievements. I guess this is one example of SMU's holistic admissions process. They were also constantly marketing their school throughout the interview by asking me if I knew that their school of accountancy was ranked xxx in the BYU rankings etc, and kept comparing them to the other 2 unis. What I got out of that interview was that the profs at SMU are really passionate about what they do and that they're incredibly driven especially when it comes to building the school's reputation.  At the end of the day, both are local universities. Employers will lump NUS/NTU/SMU together anyway. So in terms of employability, no difference really. Choose the school which suits your personality better.",13.149785490453974
2016,Singapore Management University|smu,ngee ann polytechnic|ngee ann poly|np|computer|com|infosys|information systems|analytics,"SINGAPORE: Three of Singapore's autonomous universities are refining the way they admit students under the Discretionary Admissions Scheme, which looks beyond a person's academic achievements. It comes as the universities prepare to take in more students under the scheme, when the current cap of 10 per cent allowed for discretionary admissions goes up to 15 per cent next year. ADVERTISING inRead invented by Teads National University of Singapore (NUS) is offering 7,000 places for the coming academic year, but it has received four times the number of applicants. While it has started handing out offers to those who made the cut based on their grades, about 1,800 students who did not are undergoing interviews to be considered for discretionary admissions this year. NUS has been evaluating and admitting more students under the scheme over the years. Last year, it evaluated 1,600 students, 400 more than 2014. 670 of them got in, 70 more than 2014. With more students expected to be considered for discretionary admissions, the process at NUS may be refined. Said Professor Tan Eng Chye, deputy president of academic affairs at NUS: “We are evolving; for instance, we have gotten alumni to help us with the interviews. I find that very useful because the alumni have a lot of experience in sizing up people and candidates, and they ask very useful questions. “We also provide more data on what to look out for and if the numbers get to be big, we may decide that maybe we can have sort of a test first - not an academic test per se, but perhaps a test to look at other non-academic aspects of that person. It could be an aptitude test.” Prof Tan added: “Exercising flexibility is one aspect; you also have to be fairly sharp on what to look for - it is not simply: 'OK, meet the numbers.' Our interest is to look for attributes of the applicants that would make the student community more interesting, more diversified, and enhance the interaction within the student community. “Those who can adequately and can eloquently convey their passions and interests - that would be advantageous. But we also have to look out for students who may not be able to communicate as well, but yet they have the potential for us to groom them to be able graduates.” At the Singapore Management University (SMU), discretionary admissions currently form about 5 to 8 per cent of the annual intake. With the higher cap of 15 per cent for such admissions next year, the university will have "more leeway" when assessing students. Professor Pang Yang Hoong, vice provost for undergraduate matters and student development at SMU, said: “For SMU, looking at students with other qualifications is not something terribly new because we always been holistic in the way we assess students and their suitability for admission. We will be more flexible. “(We look for) passion, the aptitude for the course for which we are admitting them into. It would also be ideal if students have demonstrated that they are successful to be in time management, that they also possess resilience and the ability to overcome difficult situations. This will help us to assess if that person has got the resilience and the determination to do well in the programme.” SMU is expecting more polytechnic graduates to apply through the discretionary route with the cap being raised to 15 per cent of the annual intake. Nanyang Technological University (NTU) will also "broaden the criteria", to give more people a shot at securing a place. It will favourably consider those who possess "enthusiasm and relevant work experience". Professor Kam Chan Hin, senior associate provost for undergraduate education at NTU, commented: “Normally, they will look at other achievements that they have - whether in sports, in arts … or even if they are very passionate about community service, leadership. So these are the things that we usually look for. “We are going to encourage all the schools to broaden the criteria, to allow more people who have a very strong passion, to be given the opportunity to be interviewed. We should be more adventurous, open it a bit more and ask more questions, outside of the usual parameters, and if you find somebody who is really very interesting and very passionate … give them a chance.” NTU had evaluated 1,400 students under the scheme last year and about 600 were given a place. All three universities said that even as they exercise flexibility, it is still important for students to show that they possess the "adequate academic competence" to go through the rigour and demands of a university education.  - CNA/ms",13.144217326738744

2016,Singapore Management University|smu,temasek polytechnic|temasek poly|tp|computer|com|infosys|information systems|analytics,"Which university? Which course of study?Aim for a course that best suits you, rather than enrol in the most lucrative one Tan Eng Chye Prof Tan is deputy president (academic affairs) and provost at the National University of Singapore. PUBLISHED 6 HOURS AGOhttp://www.straitstimes.com/singapor...ourse-of-study The university admissions season is in full swing, and this is an exciting time for students in Singapore. The tertiary education landscape here has expanded significantly, and there are now many varied and interesting pathways for students to choose from, from traditional professional degree courses in medicine or engineering, to music and the liberal arts and science. Many parents I met at the National University of Singapore's (NUS) Open Day last month remarked that they are envious of the plethora of choices their children have, and wish to be young once more. Some of you may have secured multiple offers from different universities in Singapore and overseas, and you will have to make an acceptance decision soon. But how should one decide? Every year, the Ministry of Education publishes the employment rates and median starting salaries of fresh graduates of the different degree programmes offered by local universities. I certainly hope students do not make decisions based solely on data obtained through the Graduate Employment Survey (GES). GES data provides an indication of starting salaries. Starting salaries are but a guide; they neither set the course nor determine one's career trajectory or destiny. In this volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous or "Vuca" world, one cannot predict the future or where the lucrative jobs will be. You would therefore want your university education to equip you with broad-based life skills, and develop you with the flexibility and resilience needed to pick up new knowledge, adapt to new circumstances, and exploit job opportunities across a variety of sectors throughout your lifetime of careers. Another consideration is whether and how the university course adds value to your educational journey. Some students (and parents) may look to university rankings as a measure of the strength of a university department. And there are definitely synergies between research and education. If the university department excels in research, and counts world-leading researchers in the field, it is likely that cutting-edge research will filter through to your learning experience. You will have the opportunity to be taught by highly regarded academics, and there will be plenty of opportunities to conduct research under the who's-who in the field. This is particularly valuable if you have a very strong interest in research or academia. Choosing a university that excels in your area of interest may also open up more specialised opportunities, such as advanced facilities, academic opportunities such as overseas study or research trips, as well as internships and employment opportunities with prestigious organisations in the industry. Beyond academic reputation, your choice of university will also affect your life intellectually, socially and professionally. You should evaluate the entire student experience, and whether it will suit you. Find out if the social setting on campus is what you would want to be part of. NUS has, for example, the Yale-NUS College and the University Town Residential College programmes, which offer an integrated living and learning experience, amid a collegial and intellectually vibrant setting. Another distinctive programme is the NUS Overseas Colleges programme, where students get to live, work and study in an entrepreneurial hub such as Silicon Valley, New York City or Stockholm, taking entrepreneurship classes at a partner university while working in promising entrepreneurial start-ups. All universities have carefully developed their own suite of programmes and it is worth your time and effort to find out what is on offer. Talk to the professors, and to current students. Universities hold Open Days and various outreach sessions where you can visit the campus and get first-hand information. The best-ranked university or the programme that offers you two degrees in the shortest duration may sound attractive, but they may not necessarily be what you are looking for.  Some of you may want an intensely academic experience, and to pick up as many degrees in the shortest possible time. Yet others may prefer to develop a broader range of capabilities, to try out new things, or to pursue more varied experiences. You should aim to identify a university and a course that best suits you, and not simply enrol in the most competitive or lucrative course. After all, you will be spending your next three to four years in this programme. For those of you whose grades may not meet the degree programme's published entry requirements, do not give up. All local universities have discretionary admissions schemes. Last year, NUS interviewed a record 1,600 students under the scheme, and admitted 670 students. This scheme allows universities to assess applicants more holistically, and to consider their passions and attributes such as leadership, resilience or entrepreneurial skills or talent in non-academic areas. The good news is that from the next academic year onwards, NUS, Nanyang Technological University and Singapore Management University can take in more students under the Discretionary Admissions Scheme, from 10 per cent of the annual intake currently, to up to 15 per cent. This will enable more students to enter universities on the basis of their strengths and talents, beyond academic performance. There is no perfect university. What is key is to make a considered decision with the resources and information that are available to you. Your degree should help start you on the journey to where you want to go. The knowledge, experiences and opportunities in your university life should also prepare you for life beyond your degree. As a student in Singapore, you will have up to the beginning of June to decide on your offers from most of the local universities. Whatever you eventually decide on, make the most of your university experience because, for many, it will be the best time of your life.",14.826003079247421

I was hoping to get some advice from you guys here. Firstly, Congrats to all those who have successful applications. To those who are still waiting, or got rejected, don't feel despair, i'm pretty sure you'll find your way out. Like a professional juggler once told me, his biggest lesson in juggling isn't any particular technically-advanced sleights, but this: "When the ball drops, pick it up." Simple, but means a lot. Now, my story: I am from the '94 batch. Took my A levels in 2012, flunk it really badly, because I was heavily distracted by relationship issues (broke up with my ex, which caused a whole landslide trail of problems. But that's another whole long story, and besides the point). I barely studied during A levels then, and entered the exam hall hoping to fail. But miraculously, i scraped through it, and wasn't allowed to retain in JC. The resultant problem: Straight C result, with one S grade. Devastatingly embarrassing, and was a crushing defeat. You see, I come from an IP school, and that technically means that, should I flunk my A levels, all i'm equivalent of is a Primary 6 standard. So here I am, half of my life, effectively erased on papers. I gone on to enlist in NS, and kept my report card hidden away in the "shameful" corner of my room, collecting dust. After NS, i decided to take a break, took a gap year, all these while, casting aside any thoughts on studies and the education system. I went on to completing 1 internship, and 2 other jobs, as well as backpacking around Europe, South East Asia and Australia. It was fulfilling, and definitely a worthwhile experience. But now, 3 years after receiving my poor A levels result, I finally decided to get back on to the system, and apply for university. Expectedly, even with DA (I was a former national athlete, and I had my employers write in recommendation letters), I was sorrowfully rejected. This time, it hit me hard, after all these years of "escaping", I was finally facing the music, and there and then i knew I had to do sth with my life to move on.TL;DR: I still want to enter university. I know i can do better than that "shitty" result i've got. So here's what I came for, hoping for someone to offer me some advice. Personally, I am contemplating on retaking A levels. My previous subject combination was PMEE. I know my science practical grades could no longer be used, so i have to go to a private institution to do it. I am considering going to MDIS and follow its system. (Question, does anybody have any experience or knowledge or advice on MDIS? Is it a good choice for me?) On top of that, I am intending on going for private tuition to brush up my skills, because i've heard that MDIS tutors aren't the best, or at least they aren't as good as JC MOE teachers. (So, does anybody know of any good 1-to-1 tutors, that could give you undivided attention?) Lastly, is anybody here intending to repeat A levels, I was hoping to form a study group of a couple students, and mug together, and we could encourage one another. This is my one shot, i'm giving my all, and keeping my head in the game. Thank you for reading, hope to get some responses. Really sorry to learn of your predicament. Im in a same situation as u, also from ip. Registration for re taking a levels this year as private candidate has alrdy ended. Have u tried applying to private unis such as sim? Im still waiting for smu and sim to get back to me. If all else fails, maybe we can retake together! If thats the case, i might change my combi to science instead of arts haha",14.408245651191871
2016,Singapore Management University|smu,temasek polytechnic|temasek poly|tp|computer|com|infosys|information systems|analytics,"DISCLAIMER: I'd like to say that this post is not meant to flame anyone or put a negative spotlight on anyone. The examples I highlighted below are simply the comments/questions that I spotted which inspired me to write this. I wouldn't want to start a discussion about education in Singapore here, nor would this a debate for JC vs Poly. Just a little background about myself - I was a comms student in poly, did pretty average for my GPA (3.5x), missed the uni application in my first year of army, got rejected by NTU ADM last year, finally got a late acceptance letter from ADM this year. So trust me when I say I can empathise with those who are still waiting for their acceptance letter, and why some people are asking certain questions here.Spoiler!Hi guys, care to give your opinions and views on SMU Business VS NUS Statistics?  Which one will have higher demand by employers? The answer to this is simple, ask yourself where do you want to work? MNC? Local startup? The big 4? Starting your own business? Government sector? The 'value' of a degree is only given to by the people looking at it. Even then, there are those companies in each category that would defy the stereotypical hiring policy. So my advice to the poster who asked this question is to define who are your said 'employers' first. If you have no idea where you want to work or which sector of business you want to be in, it might serve you better to understand more about the course to see which specific programme/school/school culture might suit you better rather which degree appeals more to 'employers'. It's better to make an informed choice yourself.Spoiler!Actually, people do look at where you study. I got a couple of friends in HR. They told me that they would also look at the university, course, GPA/grades, modules taken, then any leadership roles regardless of how many years of relevant work experience a person has. Some say they tend to give more priority to old boys/girls, alum, that sort of thing. I'm not saying you're wrong here buddy, and in fact you're correct in saying this! But like I mentioned previously, it depends on where you're applying for work at, what is the company's hiring policy, what are they looking for etc. Comments like this might mislead some to think that this one degree/choice of school will make or break their future. What your friends experienced are the hiring policies of their particular companies they work at, but it's definitely not the same across various companies.There's no 'one size fits all' answer to certain questions. There is also no 'only one single path' to success. Some students don't realise it yet. This is the point that I'm driving at - Students should not be afraid to seek out multiple answers to a single question. There is always more than one way to solve a single question. Isn't that how it is for Math too? There may be one solution given in the answer book but it doesn't mean that that's the only one.If you do not get your university placing in the public schools this year, there are many other options! For poly students, you can take a gap year and work first, try again next year or the year after, like what I was planning to do myself should I not get my placing this year. Work experience ain't a bad idea too. For JC students, you can always take the A's again (like what some here are planning to do), to get a better grade for your dream course on the next application. I had a friend who couldn't get pharmaceutical, retook his A's while serving NS, scored a much better grade and went on to pharmaceutical on a scholarship in the end. If you really want to study this year, then private schools might be a viable idea as well. Yes things might not have gone according to plan for you. You might have been taught your whole life that you must get into NTU/NUS/SMU, or that might have been pressure on yourself. But fact is, if you're not getting in (even after appeal), then it's on you to take your next step forward. You have to keep moving forward in life despite the obstacles you face. If you're really rejected in the end, allow yourself to be sad for a little while, then pick yourself up, make plans, take the next step forward and move on. You might have to take a little detour, but it doesn't mean you can't get there. It's just how badly you want it. I hope this lengthy post written at 3am in the morning would encourage some of you even a little, because I know what it's like to constantly fail at every turn and have life keep pushing you down. If it did, then I'm glad. ",13.900329735431113

SMU received 1,108 applications for the 45 places in the course, which means about 25 students are vying for every place. The demand for the new course has also led to a rise in total number of applications - 14,000 in all this year, a 6 per cent rise over last year. Earlier this year, when SMU announced the new course, its officials likened it to Oxford University's prestigious politics, philosophy and economics course. It is aimed at giving students a broad understanding of how the world works and will prepare them for a range of careers. Students who had applied for the course said it is an unusual combination since it includes the study of law with economics and politics - and prestigious to boot as it is being offered to only a select group of high-calibre students. Many were also drawn by the fact that the course would prepare them for a wide range of jobs, including in journalism, foreign affairs, public service, consulting and research. SMU provost Lily Kong said she was delighted with the response. She added: "From all our engagement sessions, it is clear that students, parents and employers recognise the value that the PLE combination of disciplines can bring in preparing graduates who can handle multifaceted careers... "Through a deeper understanding of how politics, law and economics intersect to shape the world in which we live, we hope to groom a new generation of leaders and thinkers for Singapore." The 45 students selected for the course will take all three subjects in the first year, before specialising in one of four areas - global studies, distribution and justice, public policy and governance, or choice and behaviour - from year two. Students will also have to go on a 10-week internship during which they will work on a project to find solutions to a real-world problem. SMU said several firms have indicated their interest in offering internships to those on the course. They include the Economic Development Board as well as consultancies like Bain and Company. SMU officials said close to 5,000 of the 14,000 applicants have been shortlisted so far. They will be further assessed via interviews. Professor Kong said that, besides academic results, SMU uses other criteria for admission. "Exam grades are a valid measure, but they cannot be the sole measure of a student's ability." The university is the first in Singapore to require all [shortlisted] candidates to attend an interview. It started the practice 16 years ago, when 2,000 students applied to become part of its pioneer batch. Interviews are still required now, although the number of candidates shortlisted for the six undergraduate degree courses has trebled. They are conducted individually or in groups, with professors on the lookout for intellectual curiosity and leadership qualities. SMU said a select group of students - about 1,000 - with strong academic and other abilities were invited to visit the university on "SMU Discovery Day" this year. Prof Kong said: "Our engagement is directed at confirming that they are indeed an excellent match for the education that SMU offers, and for them to confirm that SMU is the university of choice for them." A-level holder Benedict Lim, 20, who applied for the PLE course, said: "I have an interest in both (law and economics) and had a hard time picking one, so when I heard about SMU's new course, I jumped at the chance." He is keen on a broad-based education as he believes it will train him to be versatile and adaptable and enable him to switch careers. "You know what they say about students having to take on jobs that don't exist today. "I really do believe that. That's why it is best to have a broad-based education, so that you have a broad understanding of issues and how the world works."

2016,Singapore Management University|smu,temasek polytechnic|temasek poly|tp|computer|com|infosys|information systems|analytics,"SINGAPORE: Three of Singapore's autonomous universities are refining the way they admit students under the Discretionary Admissions Scheme, which looks beyond a person's academic achievements. It comes as the universities prepare to take in more students under the scheme, when the current cap of 10 per cent allowed for discretionary admissions goes up to 15 per cent next year. ADVERTISING inRead invented by Teads National University of Singapore (NUS) is offering 7,000 places for the coming academic year, but it has received four times the number of applicants. While it has started handing out offers to those who made the cut based on their grades, about 1,800 students who did not are undergoing interviews to be considered for discretionary admissions this year. NUS has been evaluating and admitting more students under the scheme over the years. Last year, it evaluated 1,600 students, 400 more than 2014. 670 of them got in, 70 more than 2014. With more students expected to be considered for discretionary admissions, the process at NUS may be refined. Said Professor Tan Eng Chye, deputy president of academic affairs at NUS: “We are evolving; for instance, we have gotten alumni to help us with the interviews. I find that very useful because the alumni have a lot of experience in sizing up people and candidates, and they ask very useful questions. “We also provide more data on what to look out for and if the numbers get to be big, we may decide that maybe we can have sort of a test first - not an academic test per se, but perhaps a test to look at other non-academic aspects of that person. It could be an aptitude test.” Prof Tan added: “Exercising flexibility is one aspect; you also have to be fairly sharp on what to look for - it is not simply: 'OK, meet the numbers.' Our interest is to look for attributes of the applicants that would make the student community more interesting, more diversified, and enhance the interaction within the student community. “Those who can adequately and can eloquently convey their passions and interests - that would be advantageous. But we also have to look out for students who may not be able to communicate as well, but yet they have the potential for us to groom them to be able graduates.” At the Singapore Management University (SMU), discretionary admissions currently form about 5 to 8 per cent of the annual intake. With the higher cap of 15 per cent for such admissions next year, the university will have "more leeway" when assessing students. Professor Pang Yang Hoong, vice provost for undergraduate matters and student development at SMU, said: “For SMU, looking at students with other qualifications is not something terribly new because we always been holistic in the way we assess students and their suitability for admission. We will be more flexible. “(We look for) passion, the aptitude for the course for which we are admitting them into. It would also be ideal if students have demonstrated that they are successful to be in time management, that they also possess resilience and the ability to overcome difficult situations. This will help us to assess if that person has got the resilience and the determination to do well in the programme.” SMU is expecting more polytechnic graduates to apply through the discretionary route with the cap being raised to 15 per cent of the annual intake. Nanyang Technological University (NTU) will also "broaden the criteria", to give more people a shot at securing a place. It will favourably consider those who possess "enthusiasm and relevant work experience". Professor Kam Chan Hin, senior associate provost for undergraduate education at NTU, commented: “Normally, they will look at other achievements that they have - whether in sports, in arts … or even if they are very passionate about community service, leadership. So these are the things that we usually look for. “We are going to encourage all the schools to broaden the criteria, to allow more people who have a very strong passion, to be given the opportunity to be interviewed. We should be more adventurous, open it a bit more and ask more questions, outside of the usual parameters, and if you find somebody who is really very interesting and very passionate … give them a chance.” NTU had evaluated 1,400 students under the scheme last year and about 600 were given a place. All three universities said that even as they exercise flexibility, it is still important for students to show that they possess the "adequate academic competence" to go through the rigour and demands of a university education.  - CNA/ms",13.170475639178616

Describe yourself. 2. Why do you think we should accept you? How can you contribute to NTU? 3. Did you apply in other Universities as well?Probing Questions 1. Describe yourself in 2 sentences.

Why didn't you apply for Humanities & Social Studies instead? [Probing CCAs & Interests -2] 5. Why do you still want to choose NTU instead of NUS? [Universities Choice -3] Below are just my opinions. The interview ended surprisingly faster than expected - far less than 10 minutes. However, there were no questions related to assess my competency for ACBS, and I guess that these questions are completely the same as single degree interview. Also, I doubt they even know what I actually applied for. So for those who are applying ACBS as well, do rest assure.  Comparing NTU and SMU, I find that NTU is more rigid in the way they conduct their interviews. They seem to have a list of standardized questions to be asked. Whereas for SMU, after I spoken about my attachment in one of the Big 4, the whole conversation was all about the work I did, and how I was able to cope with stress in the environment. Very friendly professors. As such, it is much easier to control your conversation topic for SMU. Again, in my opinion, NTU is more interested in how you can contribute to NTU. Whilst for SMU, the professors really want to know you as an individual. Also, the interviewers in NTU seem to be expressionless; it feels that I was talking to robots, but at the very least they did hold eye contact with me. Both are equally efficient in conducting their interviews nevertheless. Generally agree with Aomatsu.  Just to add on, I went for the ACBS interview back in 2014, because, you know, NS, and the main interviewer was Prof Valerie. We had a rather entertaining conversation and it was more of a chit-chat session than an interview. NTU knows what courses you applied for. She had my application form in hard copy on the table (in full view) and asked me why I applied for REP as my 2nd choice, and only put Accountancy (single degree) as the 3rd choice. Other than that, the main focus was definitely on how I would contribute NTU if they offered me a place/scholarship. Of course I talked about joining some clubs in NBS, my career goals and the various competitions/events at NTU which interest me. They didn't ask me those "essay" kind of questions though, but we chatted for around 20 minutes. It was a very light-hearted and enjoyable session and it felt really short in fact. After the interview, the prof invited me to apply for the USP. I also went for the SMU interview (also in 2014) for the double degree programme in Accountancy and Business. I remember being interviewed by Prof Seow and Prof Gary Pan. They seemed really concerned about whether I applied to NUS/NTU and asked me which I would pick if I was offered all 3. It somehow gave me the impression that they were being insecure/desperate. However, I liked the fact that they gave more attention to my hobbies and interests and focused less on academic achievements. I guess this is one example of SMU's holistic admissions process. They were also constantly marketing their school throughout the interview by asking me if I knew that their school of accountancy was ranked xxx in the BYU rankings etc, and kept comparing them to the other 2 unis. What I got out of that interview was that the profs at SMU are really passionate about what they do and that they're incredibly driven especially when it comes to building the school's reputation.  At the end of the day, both are local universities. Employers will lump NUS/NTU/SMU together anyway. So in terms of employability, no difference really. Choose the school which suits your personality better.",13.139027307201363

Eat whole fruits after lunch to regulate your blood sugar so you won't feel that sleepy. I ate papaya, banana or dragonfruits etc... 3. If you are a coffee jittery person, do not drink highly caffeinated beverages, such as myself  4. Try to keep your body calm, staying in aircon area works for me, because when I'm sweaty, I cannot focus. When I reached Bras Basah MRT, I couldn't quite find SIS, until I saw Subway ads, it says "Subway @ School of Information System *arrow*". Told the security personnel at the gantry that I'm here for interview, and she guided me to the lift Went up, signage were on walls and doors to guide me to a hole in a wall, where I was requested to complete a style-of-work survey (no right and wrong answer, just to see what is your working style) and waited for my turn. Diagonal to me sits another dude, cool dude who has Korean blood  we were guided by 2 presumably seniors into a room to do 2 things:  A) Stanford Karel; we were tasked to script a simple program. B) Estimation question; How many visitors land on plane in Singapore on Dec 2015? After we completed the two tasks, we were guided to a holding room with promotional videoes playing, anyone notice that SIS dean looks like the late Steve Job?  We waited about 20mins before the interview with presumably professors, Prof. Benjamin Gan and another lady professor We were asked to explain how we coded the script for Karel, and how we arrived at the estimated number for the estimation question Then the professors asked us some questions, "Why join SIS?", "If half way through the course, you lost interest in studying SIS then how?" Etc... Overall the interview lasted an hour, I arrived at 1.30pm, waited till 2pm before I started, and left exactly at 3pm. Hope this is a good reference for ya'll out there, do PM me if you got into SIS too! Can do projects together!",12.25382637414737
2016,Singapore Management University|smu,nanyang polytechnic|nanyang poly|nyp|computer|com|infosys|information systems|analytics,"Which university? Which course of study?Aim for a course that best suits you, rather than enrol in the most lucrative one Tan Eng Chye Prof Tan is deputy president (academic affairs) and provost at the National University of Singapore. PUBLISHED 6 HOURS AGOhttp://www.straitstimes.com/singapor...ourse-of-study The university admissions season is in full swing, and this is an exciting time for students in Singapore. The tertiary education landscape here has expanded significantly, and there are now many varied and interesting pathways for students to choose from, from traditional professional degree courses in medicine or engineering, to music and the liberal arts and science. Many parents I met at the National University of Singapore's (NUS) Open Day last month remarked that they are envious of the plethora of choices their children have, and wish to be young once more. Some of you may have secured multiple offers from different universities in Singapore and overseas, and you will have to make an acceptance decision soon. But how should one decide? Every year, the Ministry of Education publishes the employment rates and median starting salaries of fresh graduates of the different degree programmes offered by local universities. I certainly hope students do not make decisions based solely on data obtained through the Graduate Employment Survey (GES). GES data provides an indication of starting salaries. Starting salaries are but a guide; they neither set the course nor determine one's career trajectory or destiny. In this volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous or "Vuca" world, one cannot predict the future or where the lucrative jobs will be. You would therefore want your university education to equip you with broad-based life skills, and develop you with the flexibility and resilience needed to pick up new knowledge, adapt to new circumstances, and exploit job opportunities across a variety of sectors throughout your lifetime of careers. Another consideration is whether and how the university course adds value to your educational journey. Some students (and parents) may look to university rankings as a measure of the strength of a university department. And there are definitely synergies between research and education. If the university department excels in research, and counts world-leading researchers in the field, it is likely that cutting-edge research will filter through to your learning experience. You will have the opportunity to be taught by highly regarded academics, and there will be plenty of opportunities to conduct research under the who's-who in the field. This is particularly valuable if you have a very strong interest in research or academia. Choosing a university that excels in your area of interest may also open up more specialised opportunities, such as advanced facilities, academic opportunities such as overseas study or research trips, as well as internships and employment opportunities with prestigious organisations in the industry. Beyond academic reputation, your choice of university will also affect your life intellectually, socially and professionally. You should evaluate the entire student experience, and whether it will suit you. Find out if the social setting on campus is what you would want to be part of. NUS has, for example, the Yale-NUS College and the University Town Residential College programmes, which offer an integrated living and learning experience, amid a collegial and intellectually vibrant setting. Another distinctive programme is the NUS Overseas Colleges programme, where students get to live, work and study in an entrepreneurial hub such as Silicon Valley, New York City or Stockholm, taking entrepreneurship classes at a partner university while working in promising entrepreneurial start-ups. All universities have carefully developed their own suite of programmes and it is worth your time and effort to find out what is on offer. Talk to the professors, and to current students. Universities hold Open Days and various outreach sessions where you can visit the campus and get first-hand information. The best-ranked university or the programme that offers you two degrees in the shortest duration may sound attractive, but they may not necessarily be what you are looking for.  Some of you may want an intensely academic experience, and to pick up as many degrees in the shortest possible time. Yet others may prefer to develop a broader range of capabilities, to try out new things, or to pursue more varied experiences. You should aim to identify a university and a course that best suits you, and not simply enrol in the most competitive or lucrative course. After all, you will be spending your next three to four years in this programme. For those of you whose grades may not meet the degree programme's published entry requirements, do not give up. All local universities have discretionary admissions schemes. Last year, NUS interviewed a record 1,600 students under the scheme, and admitted 670 students. This scheme allows universities to assess applicants more holistically, and to consider their passions and attributes such as leadership, resilience or entrepreneurial skills or talent in non-academic areas. The good news is that from the next academic year onwards, NUS, Nanyang Technological University and Singapore Management University can take in more students under the Discretionary Admissions Scheme, from 10 per cent of the annual intake currently, to up to 15 per cent. This will enable more students to enter universities on the basis of their strengths and talents, beyond academic performance. There is no perfect university. What is key is to make a considered decision with the resources and information that are available to you. Your degree should help start you on the journey to where you want to go. The knowledge, experiences and opportunities in your university life should also prepare you for life beyond your degree. As a student in Singapore, you will have up to the beginning of June to decide on your offers from most of the local universities. Whatever you eventually decide on, make the most of your university experience because, for many, it will be the best time of your life.",14.819666059525165

I was hoping to get some advice from you guys here. Firstly, Congrats to all those who have successful applications. To those who are still waiting, or got rejected, don't feel despair, i'm pretty sure you'll find your way out. Like a professional juggler once told me, his biggest lesson in juggling isn't any particular technically-advanced sleights, but this: "When the ball drops, pick it up." Simple, but means a lot. Now, my story: I am from the '94 batch. Took my A levels in 2012, flunk it really badly, because I was heavily distracted by relationship issues (broke up with my ex, which caused a whole landslide trail of problems. But that's another whole long story, and besides the point). I barely studied during A levels then, and entered the exam hall hoping to fail. But miraculously, i scraped through it, and wasn't allowed to retain in JC. The resultant problem: Straight C result, with one S grade. Devastatingly embarrassing, and was a crushing defeat. You see, I come from an IP school, and that technically means that, should I flunk my A levels, all i'm equivalent of is a Primary 6 standard. So here I am, half of my life, effectively erased on papers. I gone on to enlist in NS, and kept my report card hidden away in the "shameful" corner of my room, collecting dust. After NS, i decided to take a break, took a gap year, all these while, casting aside any thoughts on studies and the education system. I went on to completing 1 internship, and 2 other jobs, as well as backpacking around Europe, South East Asia and Australia. It was fulfilling, and definitely a worthwhile experience. But now, 3 years after receiving my poor A levels result, I finally decided to get back on to the system, and apply for university. Expectedly, even with DA (I was a former national athlete, and I had my employers write in recommendation letters), I was sorrowfully rejected. This time, it hit me hard, after all these years of "escaping", I was finally facing the music, and there and then i knew I had to do sth with my life to move on.TL;DR: I still want to enter university. I know i can do better than that "shitty" result i've got. So here's what I came for, hoping for someone to offer me some advice. Personally, I am contemplating on retaking A levels. My previous subject combination was PMEE. I know my science practical grades could no longer be used, so i have to go to a private institution to do it. I am considering going to MDIS and follow its system. (Question, does anybody have any experience or knowledge or advice on MDIS? Is it a good choice for me?) On top of that, I am intending on going for private tuition to brush up my skills, because i've heard that MDIS tutors aren't the best, or at least they aren't as good as JC MOE teachers. (So, does anybody know of any good 1-to-1 tutors, that could give you undivided attention?) Lastly, is anybody here intending to repeat A levels, I was hoping to form a study group of a couple students, and mug together, and we could encourage one another. This is my one shot, i'm giving my all, and keeping my head in the game. Thank you for reading, hope to get some responses. Really sorry to learn of your predicament. Im in a same situation as u, also from ip. Registration for re taking a levels this year as private candidate has alrdy ended. Have u tried applying to private unis such as sim? Im still waiting for smu and sim to get back to me. If all else fails, maybe we can retake together! If thats the case, i might change my combi to science instead of arts haha",14.4029762146747
2016,Singapore Management University|smu,nanyang polytechnic|nanyang poly|nyp|computer|com|infosys|information systems|analytics,"DISCLAIMER: I'd like to say that this post is not meant to flame anyone or put a negative spotlight on anyone. The examples I highlighted below are simply the comments/questions that I spotted which inspired me to write this. I wouldn't want to start a discussion about education in Singapore here, nor would this a debate for JC vs Poly. Just a little background about myself - I was a comms student in poly, did pretty average for my GPA (3.5x), missed the uni application in my first year of army, got rejected by NTU ADM last year, finally got a late acceptance letter from ADM this year. So trust me when I say I can empathise with those who are still waiting for their acceptance letter, and why some people are asking certain questions here.Spoiler!Hi guys, care to give your opinions and views on SMU Business VS NUS Statistics?  Which one will have higher demand by employers? The answer to this is simple, ask yourself where do you want to work? MNC? Local startup? The big 4? Starting your own business? Government sector? The 'value' of a degree is only given to by the people looking at it. Even then, there are those companies in each category that would defy the stereotypical hiring policy. So my advice to the poster who asked this question is to define who are your said 'employers' first. If you have no idea where you want to work or which sector of business you want to be in, it might serve you better to understand more about the course to see which specific programme/school/school culture might suit you better rather which degree appeals more to 'employers'. It's better to make an informed choice yourself.Spoiler!Actually, people do look at where you study. I got a couple of friends in HR. They told me that they would also look at the university, course, GPA/grades, modules taken, then any leadership roles regardless of how many years of relevant work experience a person has. Some say they tend to give more priority to old boys/girls, alum, that sort of thing. I'm not saying you're wrong here buddy, and in fact you're correct in saying this! But like I mentioned previously, it depends on where you're applying for work at, what is the company's hiring policy, what are they looking for etc. Comments like this might mislead some to think that this one degree/choice of school will make or break their future. What your friends experienced are the hiring policies of their particular companies they work at, but it's definitely not the same across various companies.There's no 'one size fits all' answer to certain questions. There is also no 'only one single path' to success. Some students don't realise it yet. This is the point that I'm driving at - Students should not be afraid to seek out multiple answers to a single question. There is always more than one way to solve a single question. Isn't that how it is for Math too? There may be one solution given in the answer book but it doesn't mean that that's the only one.If you do not get your university placing in the public schools this year, there are many other options! For poly students, you can take a gap year and work first, try again next year or the year after, like what I was planning to do myself should I not get my placing this year. Work experience ain't a bad idea too. For JC students, you can always take the A's again (like what some here are planning to do), to get a better grade for your dream course on the next application. I had a friend who couldn't get pharmaceutical, retook his A's while serving NS, scored a much better grade and went on to pharmaceutical on a scholarship in the end. If you really want to study this year, then private schools might be a viable idea as well. Yes things might not have gone according to plan for you. You might have been taught your whole life that you must get into NTU/NUS/SMU, or that might have been pressure on yourself. But fact is, if you're not getting in (even after appeal), then it's on you to take your next step forward. You have to keep moving forward in life despite the obstacles you face. If you're really rejected in the end, allow yourself to be sad for a little while, then pick yourself up, make plans, take the next step forward and move on. You might have to take a little detour, but it doesn't mean you can't get there. It's just how badly you want it. I hope this lengthy post written at 3am in the morning would encourage some of you even a little, because I know what it's like to constantly fail at every turn and have life keep pushing you down. If it did, then I'm glad. ",13.915841450830289

SMU received 1,108 applications for the 45 places in the course, which means about 25 students are vying for every place. The demand for the new course has also led to a rise in total number of applications - 14,000 in all this year, a 6 per cent rise over last year. Earlier this year, when SMU announced the new course, its officials likened it to Oxford University's prestigious politics, philosophy and economics course. It is aimed at giving students a broad understanding of how the world works and will prepare them for a range of careers. Students who had applied for the course said it is an unusual combination since it includes the study of law with economics and politics - and prestigious to boot as it is being offered to only a select group of high-calibre students. Many were also drawn by the fact that the course would prepare them for a wide range of jobs, including in journalism, foreign affairs, public service, consulting and research. SMU provost Lily Kong said she was delighted with the response. She added: "From all our engagement sessions, it is clear that students, parents and employers recognise the value that the PLE combination of disciplines can bring in preparing graduates who can handle multifaceted careers... "Through a deeper understanding of how politics, law and economics intersect to shape the world in which we live, we hope to groom a new generation of leaders and thinkers for Singapore." The 45 students selected for the course will take all three subjects in the first year, before specialising in one of four areas - global studies, distribution and justice, public policy and governance, or choice and behaviour - from year two. Students will also have to go on a 10-week internship during which they will work on a project to find solutions to a real-world problem. SMU said several firms have indicated their interest in offering internships to those on the course. They include the Economic Development Board as well as consultancies like Bain and Company. SMU officials said close to 5,000 of the 14,000 applicants have been shortlisted so far. They will be further assessed via interviews. Professor Kong said that, besides academic results, SMU uses other criteria for admission. "Exam grades are a valid measure, but they cannot be the sole measure of a student's ability." The university is the first in Singapore to require all [shortlisted] candidates to attend an interview. It started the practice 16 years ago, when 2,000 students applied to become part of its pioneer batch. Interviews are still required now, although the number of candidates shortlisted for the six undergraduate degree courses has trebled. They are conducted individually or in groups, with professors on the lookout for intellectual curiosity and leadership qualities. SMU said a select group of students - about 1,000 - with strong academic and other abilities were invited to visit the university on "SMU Discovery Day" this year. Prof Kong said: "Our engagement is directed at confirming that they are indeed an excellent match for the education that SMU offers, and for them to confirm that SMU is the university of choice for them." A-level holder Benedict Lim, 20, who applied for the PLE course, said: "I have an interest in both (law and economics) and had a hard time picking one, so when I heard about SMU's new course, I jumped at the chance." He is keen on a broad-based education as he believes it will train him to be versatile and adaptable and enable him to switch careers. "You know what they say about students having to take on jobs that don't exist today. "I really do believe that. That's why it is best to have a broad-based education, so that you have a broad understanding of issues and how the world works."

Why didn't you apply for Humanities & Social Studies instead? [Probing CCAs & Interests -2] 5. Why do you still want to choose NTU instead of NUS? [Universities Choice -3] Below are just my opinions. The interview ended surprisingly faster than expected - far less than 10 minutes. However, there were no questions related to assess my competency for ACBS, and I guess that these questions are completely the same as single degree interview. Also, I doubt they even know what I actually applied for. So for those who are applying ACBS as well, do rest assure.  Comparing NTU and SMU, I find that NTU is more rigid in the way they conduct their interviews. They seem to have a list of standardized questions to be asked. Whereas for SMU, after I spoken about my attachment in one of the Big 4, the whole conversation was all about the work I did, and how I was able to cope with stress in the environment. Very friendly professors. As such, it is much easier to control your conversation topic for SMU. Again, in my opinion, NTU is more interested in how you can contribute to NTU. Whilst for SMU, the professors really want to know you as an individual. Also, the interviewers in NTU seem to be expressionless; it feels that I was talking to robots, but at the very least they did hold eye contact with me. Both are equally efficient in conducting their interviews nevertheless. Generally agree with Aomatsu.  Just to add on, I went for the ACBS interview back in 2014, because, you know, NS, and the main interviewer was Prof Valerie. We had a rather entertaining conversation and it was more of a chit-chat session than an interview. NTU knows what courses you applied for. She had my application form in hard copy on the table (in full view) and asked me why I applied for REP as my 2nd choice, and only put Accountancy (single degree) as the 3rd choice. Other than that, the main focus was definitely on how I would contribute NTU if they offered me a place/scholarship. Of course I talked about joining some clubs in NBS, my career goals and the various competitions/events at NTU which interest me. They didn't ask me those "essay" kind of questions though, but we chatted for around 20 minutes. It was a very light-hearted and enjoyable session and it felt really short in fact. After the interview, the prof invited me to apply for the USP. I also went for the SMU interview (also in 2014) for the double degree programme in Accountancy and Business. I remember being interviewed by Prof Seow and Prof Gary Pan. They seemed really concerned about whether I applied to NUS/NTU and asked me which I would pick if I was offered all 3. It somehow gave me the impression that they were being insecure/desperate. However, I liked the fact that they gave more attention to my hobbies and interests and focused less on academic achievements. I guess this is one example of SMU's holistic admissions process. They were also constantly marketing their school throughout the interview by asking me if I knew that their school of accountancy was ranked xxx in the BYU rankings etc, and kept comparing them to the other 2 unis. What I got out of that interview was that the profs at SMU are really passionate about what they do and that they're incredibly driven especially when it comes to building the school's reputation.  At the end of the day, both are local universities. Employers will lump NUS/NTU/SMU together anyway. So in terms of employability, no difference really. Choose the school which suits your personality better.",13.148894853046016
2016,Singapore Management University|smu,nanyang polytechnic|nanyang poly|nyp|computer|com|infosys|information systems|analytics,"SINGAPORE: Three of Singapore's autonomous universities are refining the way they admit students under the Discretionary Admissions Scheme, which looks beyond a person's academic achievements. It comes as the universities prepare to take in more students under the scheme, when the current cap of 10 per cent allowed for discretionary admissions goes up to 15 per cent next year. ADVERTISING inRead invented by Teads National University of Singapore (NUS) is offering 7,000 places for the coming academic year, but it has received four times the number of applicants. While it has started handing out offers to those who made the cut based on their grades, about 1,800 students who did not are undergoing interviews to be considered for discretionary admissions this year. NUS has been evaluating and admitting more students under the scheme over the years. Last year, it evaluated 1,600 students, 400 more than 2014. 670 of them got in, 70 more than 2014. With more students expected to be considered for discretionary admissions, the process at NUS may be refined. Said Professor Tan Eng Chye, deputy president of academic affairs at NUS: “We are evolving; for instance, we have gotten alumni to help us with the interviews. I find that very useful because the alumni have a lot of experience in sizing up people and candidates, and they ask very useful questions. “We also provide more data on what to look out for and if the numbers get to be big, we may decide that maybe we can have sort of a test first - not an academic test per se, but perhaps a test to look at other non-academic aspects of that person. It could be an aptitude test.” Prof Tan added: “Exercising flexibility is one aspect; you also have to be fairly sharp on what to look for - it is not simply: 'OK, meet the numbers.' Our interest is to look for attributes of the applicants that would make the student community more interesting, more diversified, and enhance the interaction within the student community. “Those who can adequately and can eloquently convey their passions and interests - that would be advantageous. But we also have to look out for students who may not be able to communicate as well, but yet they have the potential for us to groom them to be able graduates.” At the Singapore Management University (SMU), discretionary admissions currently form about 5 to 8 per cent of the annual intake. With the higher cap of 15 per cent for such admissions next year, the university will have "more leeway" when assessing students. Professor Pang Yang Hoong, vice provost for undergraduate matters and student development at SMU, said: “For SMU, looking at students with other qualifications is not something terribly new because we always been holistic in the way we assess students and their suitability for admission. We will be more flexible. “(We look for) passion, the aptitude for the course for which we are admitting them into. It would also be ideal if students have demonstrated that they are successful to be in time management, that they also possess resilience and the ability to overcome difficult situations. This will help us to assess if that person has got the resilience and the determination to do well in the programme.” SMU is expecting more polytechnic graduates to apply through the discretionary route with the cap being raised to 15 per cent of the annual intake. Nanyang Technological University (NTU) will also "broaden the criteria", to give more people a shot at securing a place. It will favourably consider those who possess "enthusiasm and relevant work experience". Professor Kam Chan Hin, senior associate provost for undergraduate education at NTU, commented: “Normally, they will look at other achievements that they have - whether in sports, in arts … or even if they are very passionate about community service, leadership. So these are the things that we usually look for. “We are going to encourage all the schools to broaden the criteria, to allow more people who have a very strong passion, to be given the opportunity to be interviewed. We should be more adventurous, open it a bit more and ask more questions, outside of the usual parameters, and if you find somebody who is really very interesting and very passionate … give them a chance.” NTU had evaluated 1,400 students under the scheme last year and about 600 were given a place. All three universities said that even as they exercise flexibility, it is still important for students to show that they possess the "adequate academic competence" to go through the rigour and demands of a university education.  - CNA/ms",13.146512570429007

Which course of study?Aim for a course that best suits you, rather than enrol in the most lucrative one Tan Eng Chye Prof Tan is deputy president (academic affairs) and provost at the National University of Singapore. PUBLISHED 6 HOURS AGOhttp://www.straitstimes.com/singapor...ourse-of-study The university admissions season is in full swing, and this is an exciting time for students in Singapore. The tertiary education landscape here has expanded significantly, and there are now many varied and interesting pathways for students to choose from, from traditional professional degree courses in medicine or engineering, to music and the liberal arts and science. Many parents I met at the National University of Singapore's (NUS) Open Day last month remarked that they are envious of the plethora of choices their children have, and wish to be young once more. Some of you may have secured multiple offers from different universities in Singapore and overseas, and you will have to make an acceptance decision soon. But how should one decide? Every year, the Ministry of Education publishes the employment rates and median starting salaries of fresh graduates of the different degree programmes offered by local universities. I certainly hope students do not make decisions based solely on data obtained through the Graduate Employment Survey (GES). GES data provides an indication of starting salaries. Starting salaries are but a guide; they neither set the course nor determine one's career trajectory or destiny. In this volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous or "Vuca" world, one cannot predict the future or where the lucrative jobs will be. You would therefore want your university education to equip you with broad-based life skills, and develop you with the flexibility and resilience needed to pick up new knowledge, adapt to new circumstances, and exploit job opportunities across a variety of sectors throughout your lifetime of careers. Another consideration is whether and how the university course adds value to your educational journey. Some students (and parents) may look to university rankings as a measure of the strength of a university department. And there are definitely synergies between research and education. If the university department excels in research, and counts world-leading researchers in the field, it is likely that cutting-edge research will filter through to your learning experience. You will have the opportunity to be taught by highly regarded academics, and there will be plenty of opportunities to conduct research under the who's-who in the field. This is particularly valuable if you have a very strong interest in research or academia. Choosing a university that excels in your area of interest may also open up more specialised opportunities, such as advanced facilities, academic opportunities such as overseas study or research trips, as well as internships and employment opportunities with prestigious organisations in the industry. Beyond academic reputation, your choice of university will also affect your life intellectually, socially and professionally. You should evaluate the entire student experience, and whether it will suit you. Find out if the social setting on campus is what you would want to be part of. NUS has, for example, the Yale-NUS College and the University Town Residential College programmes, which offer an integrated living and learning experience, amid a collegial and intellectually vibrant setting. Another distinctive programme is the NUS Overseas Colleges programme, where students get to live, work and study in an entrepreneurial hub such as Silicon Valley, New York City or Stockholm, taking entrepreneurship classes at a partner university while working in promising entrepreneurial start-ups. All universities have carefully developed their own suite of programmes and it is worth your time and effort to find out what is on offer. Talk to the professors, and to current students. Universities hold Open Days and various outreach sessions where you can visit the campus and get first-hand information. The best-ranked university or the programme that offers you two degrees in the shortest duration may sound attractive, but they may not necessarily be what you are looking for.  Some of you may want an intensely academic experience, and to pick up as many degrees in the shortest possible time. Yet others may prefer to develop a broader range of capabilities, to try out new things, or to pursue more varied experiences. You should aim to identify a university and a course that best suits you, and not simply enrol in the most competitive or lucrative course. After all, you will be spending your next three to four years in this programme. For those of you whose grades may not meet the degree programme's published entry requirements, do not give up. All local universities have discretionary admissions schemes. Last year, NUS interviewed a record 1,600 students under the scheme, and admitted 670 students. This scheme allows universities to assess applicants more holistically, and to consider their passions and attributes such as leadership, resilience or entrepreneurial skills or talent in non-academic areas. The good news is that from the next academic year onwards, NUS, Nanyang Technological University and Singapore Management University can take in more students under the Discretionary Admissions Scheme, from 10 per cent of the annual intake currently, to up to 15 per cent. This will enable more students to enter universities on the basis of their strengths and talents, beyond academic performance. There is no perfect university. What is key is to make a considered decision with the resources and information that are available to you. Your degree should help start you on the journey to where you want to go. The knowledge, experiences and opportunities in your university life should also prepare you for life beyond your degree. As a student in Singapore, you will have up to the beginning of June to decide on your offers from most of the local universities. Whatever you eventually decide on, make the most of your university experience because, for many, it will be the best time of your life.",14.829153173214898

I was hoping to get some advice from you guys here. Firstly, Congrats to all those who have successful applications. To those who are still waiting, or got rejected, don't feel despair, i'm pretty sure you'll find your way out. Like a professional juggler once told me, his biggest lesson in juggling isn't any particular technically-advanced sleights, but this: "When the ball drops, pick it up." Simple, but means a lot. Now, my story: I am from the '94 batch. Took my A levels in 2012, flunk it really badly, because I was heavily distracted by relationship issues (broke up with my ex, which caused a whole landslide trail of problems. But that's another whole long story, and besides the point). I barely studied during A levels then, and entered the exam hall hoping to fail. But miraculously, i scraped through it, and wasn't allowed to retain in JC. The resultant problem: Straight C result, with one S grade. Devastatingly embarrassing, and was a crushing defeat. You see, I come from an IP school, and that technically means that, should I flunk my A levels, all i'm equivalent of is a Primary 6 standard. So here I am, half of my life, effectively erased on papers. I gone on to enlist in NS, and kept my report card hidden away in the "shameful" corner of my room, collecting dust. After NS, i decided to take a break, took a gap year, all these while, casting aside any thoughts on studies and the education system. I went on to completing 1 internship, and 2 other jobs, as well as backpacking around Europe, South East Asia and Australia. It was fulfilling, and definitely a worthwhile experience. But now, 3 years after receiving my poor A levels result, I finally decided to get back on to the system, and apply for university. Expectedly, even with DA (I was a former national athlete, and I had my employers write in recommendation letters), I was sorrowfully rejected. This time, it hit me hard, after all these years of "escaping", I was finally facing the music, and there and then i knew I had to do sth with my life to move on.TL;DR: I still want to enter university. I know i can do better than that "shitty" result i've got. So here's what I came for, hoping for someone to offer me some advice. Personally, I am contemplating on retaking A levels. My previous subject combination was PMEE. I know my science practical grades could no longer be used, so i have to go to a private institution to do it. I am considering going to MDIS and follow its system. (Question, does anybody have any experience or knowledge or advice on MDIS? Is it a good choice for me?) On top of that, I am intending on going for private tuition to brush up my skills, because i've heard that MDIS tutors aren't the best, or at least they aren't as good as JC MOE teachers. (So, does anybody know of any good 1-to-1 tutors, that could give you undivided attention?) Lastly, is anybody here intending to repeat A levels, I was hoping to form a study group of a couple students, and mug together, and we could encourage one another. This is my one shot, i'm giving my all, and keeping my head in the game. Thank you for reading, hope to get some responses. Really sorry to learn of your predicament. Im in a same situation as u, also from ip. Registration for re taking a levels this year as private candidate has alrdy ended. Have u tried applying to private unis such as sim? Im still waiting for smu and sim to get back to me. If all else fails, maybe we can retake together! If thats the case, i might change my combi to science instead of arts haha",14.372325656409052
2016,Singapore Management University|smu,Anderson Serangoon Junior College|Anderson Junior College|Serangoon Junior college|anderson jc|serangoon jc|sjc|ajc|asjc|computer|com|infosys|information systems|analytics,"DISCLAIMER: I'd like to say that this post is not meant to flame anyone or put a negative spotlight on anyone. The examples I highlighted below are simply the comments/questions that I spotted which inspired me to write this. I wouldn't want to start a discussion about education in Singapore here, nor would this a debate for JC vs Poly. Just a little background about myself - I was a comms student in poly, did pretty average for my GPA (3.5x), missed the uni application in my first year of army, got rejected by NTU ADM last year, finally got a late acceptance letter from ADM this year. So trust me when I say I can empathise with those who are still waiting for their acceptance letter, and why some people are asking certain questions here.Spoiler!Hi guys, care to give your opinions and views on SMU Business VS NUS Statistics?  Which one will have higher demand by employers? The answer to this is simple, ask yourself where do you want to work? MNC? Local startup? The big 4? Starting your own business? Government sector? The 'value' of a degree is only given to by the people looking at it. Even then, there are those companies in each category that would defy the stereotypical hiring policy. So my advice to the poster who asked this question is to define who are your said 'employers' first. If you have no idea where you want to work or which sector of business you want to be in, it might serve you better to understand more about the course to see which specific programme/school/school culture might suit you better rather which degree appeals more to 'employers'. It's better to make an informed choice yourself.Spoiler!Actually, people do look at where you study. I got a couple of friends in HR. They told me that they would also look at the university, course, GPA/grades, modules taken, then any leadership roles regardless of how many years of relevant work experience a person has. Some say they tend to give more priority to old boys/girls, alum, that sort of thing. I'm not saying you're wrong here buddy, and in fact you're correct in saying this! But like I mentioned previously, it depends on where you're applying for work at, what is the company's hiring policy, what are they looking for etc. Comments like this might mislead some to think that this one degree/choice of school will make or break their future. What your friends experienced are the hiring policies of their particular companies they work at, but it's definitely not the same across various companies.There's no 'one size fits all' answer to certain questions. There is also no 'only one single path' to success. Some students don't realise it yet. This is the point that I'm driving at - Students should not be afraid to seek out multiple answers to a single question. There is always more than one way to solve a single question. Isn't that how it is for Math too? There may be one solution given in the answer book but it doesn't mean that that's the only one.If you do not get your university placing in the public schools this year, there are many other options! For poly students, you can take a gap year and work first, try again next year or the year after, like what I was planning to do myself should I not get my placing this year. Work experience ain't a bad idea too. For JC students, you can always take the A's again (like what some here are planning to do), to get a better grade for your dream course on the next application. I had a friend who couldn't get pharmaceutical, retook his A's while serving NS, scored a much better grade and went on to pharmaceutical on a scholarship in the end. If you really want to study this year, then private schools might be a viable idea as well. Yes things might not have gone according to plan for you. You might have been taught your whole life that you must get into NTU/NUS/SMU, or that might have been pressure on yourself. But fact is, if you're not getting in (even after appeal), then it's on you to take your next step forward. You have to keep moving forward in life despite the obstacles you face. If you're really rejected in the end, allow yourself to be sad for a little while, then pick yourself up, make plans, take the next step forward and move on. You might have to take a little detour, but it doesn't mean you can't get there. It's just how badly you want it. I hope this lengthy post written at 3am in the morning would encourage some of you even a little, because I know what it's like to constantly fail at every turn and have life keep pushing you down. If it did, then I'm glad. ",13.914498946647969

SMU received 1,108 applications for the 45 places in the course, which means about 25 students are vying for every place. The demand for the new course has also led to a rise in total number of applications - 14,000 in all this year, a 6 per cent rise over last year. Earlier this year, when SMU announced the new course, its officials likened it to Oxford University's prestigious politics, philosophy and economics course. It is aimed at giving students a broad understanding of how the world works and will prepare them for a range of careers. Students who had applied for the course said it is an unusual combination since it includes the study of law with economics and politics - and prestigious to boot as it is being offered to only a select group of high-calibre students. Many were also drawn by the fact that the course would prepare them for a wide range of jobs, including in journalism, foreign affairs, public service, consulting and research. SMU provost Lily Kong said she was delighted with the response. She added: "From all our engagement sessions, it is clear that students, parents and employers recognise the value that the PLE combination of disciplines can bring in preparing graduates who can handle multifaceted careers... "Through a deeper understanding of how politics, law and economics intersect to shape the world in which we live, we hope to groom a new generation of leaders and thinkers for Singapore." The 45 students selected for the course will take all three subjects in the first year, before specialising in one of four areas - global studies, distribution and justice, public policy and governance, or choice and behaviour - from year two. Students will also have to go on a 10-week internship during which they will work on a project to find solutions to a real-world problem. SMU said several firms have indicated their interest in offering internships to those on the course. They include the Economic Development Board as well as consultancies like Bain and Company. SMU officials said close to 5,000 of the 14,000 applicants have been shortlisted so far. They will be further assessed via interviews. Professor Kong said that, besides academic results, SMU uses other criteria for admission. "Exam grades are a valid measure, but they cannot be the sole measure of a student's ability." The university is the first in Singapore to require all [shortlisted] candidates to attend an interview. It started the practice 16 years ago, when 2,000 students applied to become part of its pioneer batch. Interviews are still required now, although the number of candidates shortlisted for the six undergraduate degree courses has trebled. They are conducted individually or in groups, with professors on the lookout for intellectual curiosity and leadership qualities. SMU said a select group of students - about 1,000 - with strong academic and other abilities were invited to visit the university on "SMU Discovery Day" this year. Prof Kong said: "Our engagement is directed at confirming that they are indeed an excellent match for the education that SMU offers, and for them to confirm that SMU is the university of choice for them." A-level holder Benedict Lim, 20, who applied for the PLE course, said: "I have an interest in both (law and economics) and had a hard time picking one, so when I heard about SMU's new course, I jumped at the chance." He is keen on a broad-based education as he believes it will train him to be versatile and adaptable and enable him to switch careers. "You know what they say about students having to take on jobs that don't exist today. "I really do believe that. That's why it is best to have a broad-based education, so that you have a broad understanding of issues and how the world works." Probably an inflated nunber What they shld publish rather is the number of ppl putting that as their first choice at smu",13.257581219483185
2016,Singapore Management University|smu,Anderson Serangoon Junior College|Anderson Junior College|Serangoon Junior college|anderson jc|serangoon jc|sjc|ajc|asjc|computer|com|infosys|information systems|analytics,"SINGAPORE: Three of Singapore's autonomous universities are refining the way they admit students under the Discretionary Admissions Scheme, which looks beyond a person's academic achievements. It comes as the universities prepare to take in more students under the scheme, when the current cap of 10 per cent allowed for discretionary admissions goes up to 15 per cent next year. ADVERTISING inRead invented by Teads National University of Singapore (NUS) is offering 7,000 places for the coming academic year, but it has received four times the number of applicants. While it has started handing out offers to those who made the cut based on their grades, about 1,800 students who did not are undergoing interviews to be considered for discretionary admissions this year. NUS has been evaluating and admitting more students under the scheme over the years. Last year, it evaluated 1,600 students, 400 more than 2014. 670 of them got in, 70 more than 2014. With more students expected to be considered for discretionary admissions, the process at NUS may be refined. Said Professor Tan Eng Chye, deputy president of academic affairs at NUS: “We are evolving; for instance, we have gotten alumni to help us with the interviews. I find that very useful because the alumni have a lot of experience in sizing up people and candidates, and they ask very useful questions. “We also provide more data on what to look out for and if the numbers get to be big, we may decide that maybe we can have sort of a test first - not an academic test per se, but perhaps a test to look at other non-academic aspects of that person. It could be an aptitude test.” Prof Tan added: “Exercising flexibility is one aspect; you also have to be fairly sharp on what to look for - it is not simply: 'OK, meet the numbers.' Our interest is to look for attributes of the applicants that would make the student community more interesting, more diversified, and enhance the interaction within the student community. “Those who can adequately and can eloquently convey their passions and interests - that would be advantageous. But we also have to look out for students who may not be able to communicate as well, but yet they have the potential for us to groom them to be able graduates.” At the Singapore Management University (SMU), discretionary admissions currently form about 5 to 8 per cent of the annual intake. With the higher cap of 15 per cent for such admissions next year, the university will have "more leeway" when assessing students. Professor Pang Yang Hoong, vice provost for undergraduate matters and student development at SMU, said: “For SMU, looking at students with other qualifications is not something terribly new because we always been holistic in the way we assess students and their suitability for admission. We will be more flexible. “(We look for) passion, the aptitude for the course for which we are admitting them into. It would also be ideal if students have demonstrated that they are successful to be in time management, that they also possess resilience and the ability to overcome difficult situations. This will help us to assess if that person has got the resilience and the determination to do well in the programme.” SMU is expecting more polytechnic graduates to apply through the discretionary route with the cap being raised to 15 per cent of the annual intake. Nanyang Technological University (NTU) will also "broaden the criteria", to give more people a shot at securing a place. It will favourably consider those who possess "enthusiasm and relevant work experience". Professor Kam Chan Hin, senior associate provost for undergraduate education at NTU, commented: “Normally, they will look at other achievements that they have - whether in sports, in arts … or even if they are very passionate about community service, leadership. So these are the things that we usually look for. “We are going to encourage all the schools to broaden the criteria, to allow more people who have a very strong passion, to be given the opportunity to be interviewed. We should be more adventurous, open it a bit more and ask more questions, outside of the usual parameters, and if you find somebody who is really very interesting and very passionate … give them a chance.” NTU had evaluated 1,400 students under the scheme last year and about 600 were given a place. All three universities said that even as they exercise flexibility, it is still important for students to show that they possess the "adequate academic competence" to go through the rigour and demands of a university education.  - CNA/ms",13.148333691613786

The interview ended surprisingly faster than expected - far less than 10 minutes. However, there were no questions related to assess my competency for ACBS, and I guess that these questions are completely the same as single degree interview. Also, I doubt they even know what I actually applied for. So for those who are applying ACBS as well, do rest assure.  Comparing NTU and SMU, I find that NTU is more rigid in the way they conduct their interviews. They seem to have a list of standardized questions to be asked. Whereas for SMU, after I spoken about my attachment in one of the Big 4, the whole conversation was all about the work I did, and how I was able to cope with stress in the environment. Very friendly professors. As such, it is much easier to control your conversation topic for SMU. Again, in my opinion, NTU is more interested in how you can contribute to NTU. Whilst for SMU, the professors really want to know you as an individual. Also, the interviewers in NTU seem to be expressionless; it feels that I was talking to robots, but at the very least they did hold eye contact with me. Both are equally efficient in conducting their interviews nevertheless. Generally agree with Aomatsu.  Just to add on, I went for the ACBS interview back in 2014, because, you know, NS, and the main interviewer was Prof Valerie. We had a rather entertaining conversation and it was more of a chit-chat session than an interview. NTU knows what courses you applied for. She had my application form in hard copy on the table (in full view) and asked me why I applied for REP as my 2nd choice, and only put Accountancy (single degree) as the 3rd choice. Other than that, the main focus was definitely on how I would contribute NTU if they offered me a place/scholarship. Of course I talked about joining some clubs in NBS, my career goals and the various competitions/events at NTU which interest me. They didn't ask me those "essay" kind of questions though, but we chatted for around 20 minutes. It was a very light-hearted and enjoyable session and it felt really short in fact. After the interview, the prof invited me to apply for the USP. I also went for the SMU interview (also in 2014) for the double degree programme in Accountancy and Business. I remember being interviewed by Prof Seow and Prof Gary Pan. They seemed really concerned about whether I applied to NUS/NTU and asked me which I would pick if I was offered all 3. It somehow gave me the impression that they were being insecure/desperate. However, I liked the fact that they gave more attention to my hobbies and interests and focused less on academic achievements. I guess this is one example of SMU's holistic admissions process. They were also constantly marketing their school throughout the interview by asking me if I knew that their school of accountancy was ranked xxx in the BYU rankings etc, and kept comparing them to the other 2 unis. What I got out of that interview was that the profs at SMU are really passionate about what they do and that they're incredibly driven especially when it comes to building the school's reputation.  At the end of the day, both are local universities. Employers will lump NUS/NTU/SMU together anyway. So in terms of employability, no difference really. Choose the school which suits your personality better.",13.142454713816718

SMU received 1,108 applications for the 45 places in the course, which means about 25 students are vying for every place. The demand for the new course has also led to a rise in total number of applications - 14,000 in all this year, a 6 per cent rise over last year. Earlier this year, when SMU announced the new course, its officials likened it to Oxford University's prestigious politics, philosophy and economics course. It is aimed at giving students a broad understanding of how the world works and will prepare them for a range of careers. Students who had applied for the course said it is an unusual combination since it includes the study of law with economics and politics - and prestigious to boot as it is being offered to only a select group of high-calibre students. Many were also drawn by the fact that the course would prepare them for a wide range of jobs, including in journalism, foreign affairs, public service, consulting and research. SMU provost Lily Kong said she was delighted with the response. She added: "From all our engagement sessions, it is clear that students, parents and employers recognise the value that the PLE combination of disciplines can bring in preparing graduates who can handle multifaceted careers... "Through a deeper understanding of how politics, law and economics intersect to shape the world in which we live, we hope to groom a new generation of leaders and thinkers for Singapore." The 45 students selected for the course will take all three subjects in the first year, before specialising in one of four areas - global studies, distribution and justice, public policy and governance, or choice and behaviour - from year two. Students will also have to go on a 10-week internship during which they will work on a project to find solutions to a real-world problem. SMU said several firms have indicated their interest in offering internships to those on the course. They include the Economic Development Board as well as consultancies like Bain and Company. SMU officials said close to 5,000 of the 14,000 applicants have been shortlisted so far. They will be further assessed via interviews. Professor Kong said that, besides academic results, SMU uses other criteria for admission. "Exam grades are a valid measure, but they cannot be the sole measure of a student's ability." The university is the first in Singapore to require all [shortlisted] candidates to attend an interview. It started the practice 16 years ago, when 2,000 students applied to become part of its pioneer batch. Interviews are still required now, although the number of candidates shortlisted for the six undergraduate degree courses has trebled. They are conducted individually or in groups, with professors on the lookout for intellectual curiosity and leadership qualities. SMU said a select group of students - about 1,000 - with strong academic and other abilities were invited to visit the university on "SMU Discovery Day" this year. Prof Kong said: "Our engagement is directed at confirming that they are indeed an excellent match for the education that SMU offers, and for them to confirm that SMU is the university of choice for them." A-level holder Benedict Lim, 20, who applied for the PLE course, said: "I have an interest in both (law and economics) and had a hard time picking one, so when I heard about SMU's new course, I jumped at the chance." He is keen on a broad-based education as he believes it will train him to be versatile and adaptable and enable him to switch careers. "You know what they say about students having to take on jobs that don't exist today. "I really do believe that. That's why it is best to have a broad-based education, so that you have a broad understanding of issues and how the world works."",12.996025800973168

2016,Singapore Management University|smu,Anglo-Chinese Junior College|anglo chinese junior college|anglo-chinese jc|acjc|computer|com|infosys|information systems|analytics,"Which university? Which course of study?Aim for a course that best suits you, rather than enrol in the most lucrative one Tan Eng Chye Prof Tan is deputy president (academic affairs) and provost at the National University of Singapore. PUBLISHED 6 HOURS AGOhttp://www.straitstimes.com/singapor...ourse-of-study The university admissions season is in full swing, and this is an exciting time for students in Singapore. The tertiary education landscape here has expanded significantly, and there are now many varied and interesting pathways for students to choose from, from traditional professional degree courses in medicine or engineering, to music and the liberal arts and science. Many parents I met at the National University of Singapore's (NUS) Open Day last month remarked that they are envious of the plethora of choices their children have, and wish to be young once more. Some of you may have secured multiple offers from different universities in Singapore and overseas, and you will have to make an acceptance decision soon. But how should one decide? Every year, the Ministry of Education publishes the employment rates and median starting salaries of fresh graduates of the different degree programmes offered by local universities. I certainly hope students do not make decisions based solely on data obtained through the Graduate Employment Survey (GES). GES data provides an indication of starting salaries. Starting salaries are but a guide; they neither set the course nor determine one's career trajectory or destiny. In this volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous or "Vuca" world, one cannot predict the future or where the lucrative jobs will be. You would therefore want your university education to equip you with broad-based life skills, and develop you with the flexibility and resilience needed to pick up new knowledge, adapt to new circumstances, and exploit job opportunities across a variety of sectors throughout your lifetime of careers. Another consideration is whether and how the university course adds value to your educational journey. Some students (and parents) may look to university rankings as a measure of the strength of a university department. And there are definitely synergies between research and education. If the university department excels in research, and counts world-leading researchers in the field, it is likely that cutting-edge research will filter through to your learning experience. You will have the opportunity to be taught by highly regarded academics, and there will be plenty of opportunities to conduct research under the who's-who in the field. This is particularly valuable if you have a very strong interest in research or academia. Choosing a university that excels in your area of interest may also open up more specialised opportunities, such as advanced facilities, academic opportunities such as overseas study or research trips, as well as internships and employment opportunities with prestigious organisations in the industry. Beyond academic reputation, your choice of university will also affect your life intellectually, socially and professionally. You should evaluate the entire student experience, and whether it will suit you. Find out if the social setting on campus is what you would want to be part of. NUS has, for example, the Yale-NUS College and the University Town Residential College programmes, which offer an integrated living and learning experience, amid a collegial and intellectually vibrant setting. Another distinctive programme is the NUS Overseas Colleges programme, where students get to live, work and study in an entrepreneurial hub such as Silicon Valley, New York City or Stockholm, taking entrepreneurship classes at a partner university while working in promising entrepreneurial start-ups. All universities have carefully developed their own suite of programmes and it is worth your time and effort to find out what is on offer. Talk to the professors, and to current students. Universities hold Open Days and various outreach sessions where you can visit the campus and get first-hand information. The best-ranked university or the programme that offers you two degrees in the shortest duration may sound attractive, but they may not necessarily be what you are looking for.  Some of you may want an intensely academic experience, and to pick up as many degrees in the shortest possible time. Yet others may prefer to develop a broader range of capabilities, to try out new things, or to pursue more varied experiences. You should aim to identify a university and a course that best suits you, and not simply enrol in the most competitive or lucrative course. After all, you will be spending your next three to four years in this programme. For those of you whose grades may not meet the degree programme's published entry requirements, do not give up. All local universities have discretionary admissions schemes. Last year, NUS interviewed a record 1,600 students under the scheme, and admitted 670 students. This scheme allows universities to assess applicants more holistically, and to consider their passions and attributes such as leadership, resilience or entrepreneurial skills or talent in non-academic areas. The good news is that from the next academic year onwards, NUS, Nanyang Technological University and Singapore Management University can take in more students under the Discretionary Admissions Scheme, from 10 per cent of the annual intake currently, to up to 15 per cent. This will enable more students to enter universities on the basis of their strengths and talents, beyond academic performance. There is no perfect university. What is key is to make a considered decision with the resources and information that are available to you. Your degree should help start you on the journey to where you want to go. The knowledge, experiences and opportunities in your university life should also prepare you for life beyond your degree. As a student in Singapore, you will have up to the beginning of June to decide on your offers from most of the local universities. Whatever you eventually decide on, make the most of your university experience because, for many, it will be the best time of your life.",14.829153173214898

I was hoping to get some advice from you guys here. Firstly, Congrats to all those who have successful applications. To those who are still waiting, or got rejected, don't feel despair, i'm pretty sure you'll find your way out. Like a professional juggler once told me, his biggest lesson in juggling isn't any particular technically-advanced sleights, but this: "When the ball drops, pick it up." Simple, but means a lot. Now, my story: I am from the '94 batch. Took my A levels in 2012, flunk it really badly, because I was heavily distracted by relationship issues (broke up with my ex, which caused a whole landslide trail of problems. But that's another whole long story, and besides the point). I barely studied during A levels then, and entered the exam hall hoping to fail. But miraculously, i scraped through it, and wasn't allowed to retain in JC. The resultant problem: Straight C result, with one S grade. Devastatingly embarrassing, and was a crushing defeat. You see, I come from an IP school, and that technically means that, should I flunk my A levels, all i'm equivalent of is a Primary 6 standard. So here I am, half of my life, effectively erased on papers. I gone on to enlist in NS, and kept my report card hidden away in the "shameful" corner of my room, collecting dust. After NS, i decided to take a break, took a gap year, all these while, casting aside any thoughts on studies and the education system. I went on to completing 1 internship, and 2 other jobs, as well as backpacking around Europe, South East Asia and Australia. It was fulfilling, and definitely a worthwhile experience. But now, 3 years after receiving my poor A levels result, I finally decided to get back on to the system, and apply for university. Expectedly, even with DA (I was a former national athlete, and I had my employers write in recommendation letters), I was sorrowfully rejected. This time, it hit me hard, after all these years of "escaping", I was finally facing the music, and there and then i knew I had to do sth with my life to move on.TL;DR: I still want to enter university. I know i can do better than that "shitty" result i've got. So here's what I came for, hoping for someone to offer me some advice. Personally, I am contemplating on retaking A levels. My previous subject combination was PMEE. I know my science practical grades could no longer be used, so i have to go to a private institution to do it. I am considering going to MDIS and follow its system. (Question, does anybody have any experience or knowledge or advice on MDIS? Is it a good choice for me?) On top of that, I am intending on going for private tuition to brush up my skills, because i've heard that MDIS tutors aren't the best, or at least they aren't as good as JC MOE teachers. (So, does anybody know of any good 1-to-1 tutors, that could give you undivided attention?) Lastly, is anybody here intending to repeat A levels, I was hoping to form a study group of a couple students, and mug together, and we could encourage one another. This is my one shot, i'm giving my all, and keeping my head in the game. Thank you for reading, hope to get some responses. Really sorry to learn of your predicament. Im in a same situation as u, also from ip. Registration for re taking a levels this year as private candidate has alrdy ended. Have u tried applying to private unis such as sim? Im still waiting for smu and sim to get back to me. If all else fails, maybe we can retake together! If thats the case, i might change my combi to science instead of arts haha",14.372325656409052
2016,Singapore Management University|smu,Anglo-Chinese Junior College|anglo chinese junior college|anglo-chinese jc|acjc|computer|com|infosys|information systems|analytics,"DISCLAIMER: I'd like to say that this post is not meant to flame anyone or put a negative spotlight on anyone. The examples I highlighted below are simply the comments/questions that I spotted which inspired me to write this. I wouldn't want to start a discussion about education in Singapore here, nor would this a debate for JC vs Poly. Just a little background about myself - I was a comms student in poly, did pretty average for my GPA (3.5x), missed the uni application in my first year of army, got rejected by NTU ADM last year, finally got a late acceptance letter from ADM this year. So trust me when I say I can empathise with those who are still waiting for their acceptance letter, and why some people are asking certain questions here.Spoiler!Hi guys, care to give your opinions and views on SMU Business VS NUS Statistics?  Which one will have higher demand by employers? The answer to this is simple, ask yourself where do you want to work? MNC? Local startup? The big 4? Starting your own business? Government sector? The 'value' of a degree is only given to by the people looking at it. Even then, there are those companies in each category that would defy the stereotypical hiring policy. So my advice to the poster who asked this question is to define who are your said 'employers' first. If you have no idea where you want to work or which sector of business you want to be in, it might serve you better to understand more about the course to see which specific programme/school/school culture might suit you better rather which degree appeals more to 'employers'. It's better to make an informed choice yourself.Spoiler!Actually, people do look at where you study. I got a couple of friends in HR. They told me that they would also look at the university, course, GPA/grades, modules taken, then any leadership roles regardless of how many years of relevant work experience a person has. Some say they tend to give more priority to old boys/girls, alum, that sort of thing. I'm not saying you're wrong here buddy, and in fact you're correct in saying this! But like I mentioned previously, it depends on where you're applying for work at, what is the company's hiring policy, what are they looking for etc. Comments like this might mislead some to think that this one degree/choice of school will make or break their future. What your friends experienced are the hiring policies of their particular companies they work at, but it's definitely not the same across various companies.There's no 'one size fits all' answer to certain questions. There is also no 'only one single path' to success. Some students don't realise it yet. This is the point that I'm driving at - Students should not be afraid to seek out multiple answers to a single question. There is always more than one way to solve a single question. Isn't that how it is for Math too? There may be one solution given in the answer book but it doesn't mean that that's the only one.If you do not get your university placing in the public schools this year, there are many other options! For poly students, you can take a gap year and work first, try again next year or the year after, like what I was planning to do myself should I not get my placing this year. Work experience ain't a bad idea too. For JC students, you can always take the A's again (like what some here are planning to do), to get a better grade for your dream course on the next application. I had a friend who couldn't get pharmaceutical, retook his A's while serving NS, scored a much better grade and went on to pharmaceutical on a scholarship in the end. If you really want to study this year, then private schools might be a viable idea as well. Yes things might not have gone according to plan for you. You might have been taught your whole life that you must get into NTU/NUS/SMU, or that might have been pressure on yourself. But fact is, if you're not getting in (even after appeal), then it's on you to take your next step forward. You have to keep moving forward in life despite the obstacles you face. If you're really rejected in the end, allow yourself to be sad for a little while, then pick yourself up, make plans, take the next step forward and move on. You might have to take a little detour, but it doesn't mean you can't get there. It's just how badly you want it. I hope this lengthy post written at 3am in the morning would encourage some of you even a little, because I know what it's like to constantly fail at every turn and have life keep pushing you down. If it did, then I'm glad. ",13.914498946647969

2016,Singapore Management University|smu,Anglo-Chinese Junior College|anglo chinese junior college|anglo-chinese jc|acjc|computer|com|infosys|information systems|analytics,"SINGAPORE: Three of Singapore's autonomous universities are refining the way they admit students under the Discretionary Admissions Scheme, which looks beyond a person's academic achievements. It comes as the universities prepare to take in more students under the scheme, when the current cap of 10 per cent allowed for discretionary admissions goes up to 15 per cent next year. ADVERTISING inRead invented by Teads National University of Singapore (NUS) is offering 7,000 places for the coming academic year, but it has received four times the number of applicants. While it has started handing out offers to those who made the cut based on their grades, about 1,800 students who did not are undergoing interviews to be considered for discretionary admissions this year. NUS has been evaluating and admitting more students under the scheme over the years. Last year, it evaluated 1,600 students, 400 more than 2014. 670 of them got in, 70 more than 2014. With more students expected to be considered for discretionary admissions, the process at NUS may be refined. Said Professor Tan Eng Chye, deputy president of academic affairs at NUS: “We are evolving; for instance, we have gotten alumni to help us with the interviews. I find that very useful because the alumni have a lot of experience in sizing up people and candidates, and they ask very useful questions. “We also provide more data on what to look out for and if the numbers get to be big, we may decide that maybe we can have sort of a test first - not an academic test per se, but perhaps a test to look at other non-academic aspects of that person. It could be an aptitude test.” Prof Tan added: “Exercising flexibility is one aspect; you also have to be fairly sharp on what to look for - it is not simply: 'OK, meet the numbers.' Our interest is to look for attributes of the applicants that would make the student community more interesting, more diversified, and enhance the interaction within the student community. “Those who can adequately and can eloquently convey their passions and interests - that would be advantageous. But we also have to look out for students who may not be able to communicate as well, but yet they have the potential for us to groom them to be able graduates.” At the Singapore Management University (SMU), discretionary admissions currently form about 5 to 8 per cent of the annual intake. With the higher cap of 15 per cent for such admissions next year, the university will have "more leeway" when assessing students. Professor Pang Yang Hoong, vice provost for undergraduate matters and student development at SMU, said: “For SMU, looking at students with other qualifications is not something terribly new because we always been holistic in the way we assess students and their suitability for admission. We will be more flexible. “(We look for) passion, the aptitude for the course for which we are admitting them into. It would also be ideal if students have demonstrated that they are successful to be in time management, that they also possess resilience and the ability to overcome difficult situations. This will help us to assess if that person has got the resilience and the determination to do well in the programme.” SMU is expecting more polytechnic graduates to apply through the discretionary route with the cap being raised to 15 per cent of the annual intake. Nanyang Technological University (NTU) will also "broaden the criteria", to give more people a shot at securing a place. It will favourably consider those who possess "enthusiasm and relevant work experience". Professor Kam Chan Hin, senior associate provost for undergraduate education at NTU, commented: “Normally, they will look at other achievements that they have - whether in sports, in arts … or even if they are very passionate about community service, leadership. So these are the things that we usually look for. “We are going to encourage all the schools to broaden the criteria, to allow more people who have a very strong passion, to be given the opportunity to be interviewed. We should be more adventurous, open it a bit more and ask more questions, outside of the usual parameters, and if you find somebody who is really very interesting and very passionate … give them a chance.” NTU had evaluated 1,400 students under the scheme last year and about 600 were given a place. All three universities said that even as they exercise flexibility, it is still important for students to show that they possess the "adequate academic competence" to go through the rigour and demands of a university education.  - CNA/ms",13.148333691613786

Why didn't you apply for Humanities & Social Studies instead? [Probing CCAs & Interests -2] 5. Why do you still want to choose NTU instead of NUS? [Universities Choice -3] Below are just my opinions. The interview ended surprisingly faster than expected - far less than 10 minutes. However, there were no questions related to assess my competency for ACBS, and I guess that these questions are completely the same as single degree interview. Also, I doubt they even know what I actually applied for. So for those who are applying ACBS as well, do rest assure.  Comparing NTU and SMU, I find that NTU is more rigid in the way they conduct their interviews. They seem to have a list of standardized questions to be asked. Whereas for SMU, after I spoken about my attachment in one of the Big 4, the whole conversation was all about the work I did, and how I was able to cope with stress in the environment. Very friendly professors. As such, it is much easier to control your conversation topic for SMU. Again, in my opinion, NTU is more interested in how you can contribute to NTU. Whilst for SMU, the professors really want to know you as an individual. Also, the interviewers in NTU seem to be expressionless; it feels that I was talking to robots, but at the very least they did hold eye contact with me. Both are equally efficient in conducting their interviews nevertheless. Generally agree with Aomatsu.  Just to add on, I went for the ACBS interview back in 2014, because, you know, NS, and the main interviewer was Prof Valerie. We had a rather entertaining conversation and it was more of a chit-chat session than an interview. NTU knows what courses you applied for. She had my application form in hard copy on the table (in full view) and asked me why I applied for REP as my 2nd choice, and only put Accountancy (single degree) as the 3rd choice. Other than that, the main focus was definitely on how I would contribute NTU if they offered me a place/scholarship. Of course I talked about joining some clubs in NBS, my career goals and the various competitions/events at NTU which interest me. They didn't ask me those "essay" kind of questions though, but we chatted for around 20 minutes. It was a very light-hearted and enjoyable session and it felt really short in fact. After the interview, the prof invited me to apply for the USP. I also went for the SMU interview (also in 2014) for the double degree programme in Accountancy and Business. I remember being interviewed by Prof Seow and Prof Gary Pan. They seemed really concerned about whether I applied to NUS/NTU and asked me which I would pick if I was offered all 3. It somehow gave me the impression that they were being insecure/desperate. However, I liked the fact that they gave more attention to my hobbies and interests and focused less on academic achievements. I guess this is one example of SMU's holistic admissions process. They were also constantly marketing their school throughout the interview by asking me if I knew that their school of accountancy was ranked xxx in the BYU rankings etc, and kept comparing them to the other 2 unis. What I got out of that interview was that the profs at SMU are really passionate about what they do and that they're incredibly driven especially when it comes to building the school's reputation.  At the end of the day, both are local universities. Employers will lump NUS/NTU/SMU together anyway. So in terms of employability, no difference really. Choose the school which suits your personality better.",13.142454713816718
2016,Singapore Management University|smu,Anglo-Chinese Junior College|anglo chinese junior college|anglo-chinese jc|acjc|computer|com|infosys|information systems|analytics,"New SMU course: 1,108 vying for 45 placesCombination of politics, law and economics proves a winner; total number of applications up 6% to 14,000 Sandra Davie, Senior Education Correspondenthttp://www.straitstimes.com/singapor...-for-45-places A new degree course at Singapore Management University (SMU) which offers a combination of politics, law and economics (PLE) is a hit with young Singaporeans hoping to land a university place this year. SMU received 1,108 applications for the 45 places in the course, which means about 25 students are vying for every place. The demand for the new course has also led to a rise in total number of applications - 14,000 in all this year, a 6 per cent rise over last year. Earlier this year, when SMU announced the new course, its officials likened it to Oxford University's prestigious politics, philosophy and economics course. It is aimed at giving students a broad understanding of how the world works and will prepare them for a range of careers. Students who had applied for the course said it is an unusual combination since it includes the study of law with economics and politics - and prestigious to boot as it is being offered to only a select group of high-calibre students. Many were also drawn by the fact that the course would prepare them for a wide range of jobs, including in journalism, foreign affairs, public service, consulting and research. SMU provost Lily Kong said she was delighted with the response. She added: "From all our engagement sessions, it is clear that students, parents and employers recognise the value that the PLE combination of disciplines can bring in preparing graduates who can handle multifaceted careers... "Through a deeper understanding of how politics, law and economics intersect to shape the world in which we live, we hope to groom a new generation of leaders and thinkers for Singapore." The 45 students selected for the course will take all three subjects in the first year, before specialising in one of four areas - global studies, distribution and justice, public policy and governance, or choice and behaviour - from year two. Students will also have to go on a 10-week internship during which they will work on a project to find solutions to a real-world problem. SMU said several firms have indicated their interest in offering internships to those on the course. They include the Economic Development Board as well as consultancies like Bain and Company. SMU officials said close to 5,000 of the 14,000 applicants have been shortlisted so far. They will be further assessed via interviews. Professor Kong said that, besides academic results, SMU uses other criteria for admission. "Exam grades are a valid measure, but they cannot be the sole measure of a student's ability." The university is the first in Singapore to require all [shortlisted] candidates to attend an interview. It started the practice 16 years ago, when 2,000 students applied to become part of its pioneer batch. Interviews are still required now, although the number of candidates shortlisted for the six undergraduate degree courses has trebled. They are conducted individually or in groups, with professors on the lookout for intellectual curiosity and leadership qualities. SMU said a select group of students - about 1,000 - with strong academic and other abilities were invited to visit the university on "SMU Discovery Day" this year. Prof Kong said: "Our engagement is directed at confirming that they are indeed an excellent match for the education that SMU offers, and for them to confirm that SMU is the university of choice for them."

2016,Singapore Management University|smu,Catholic Junior College|catholic jc|cjc|computer|com|infosys|information systems|analytics,"Which university? Which course of study?Aim for a course that best suits you, rather than enrol in the most lucrative one Tan Eng Chye Prof Tan is deputy president (academic affairs) and provost at the National University of Singapore. PUBLISHED 6 HOURS AGOhttp://www.straitstimes.com/singapor...ourse-of-study The university admissions season is in full swing, and this is an exciting time for students in Singapore. The tertiary education landscape here has expanded significantly, and there are now many varied and interesting pathways for students to choose from, from traditional professional degree courses in medicine or engineering, to music and the liberal arts and science. Many parents I met at the National University of Singapore's (NUS) Open Day last month remarked that they are envious of the plethora of choices their children have, and wish to be young once more. Some of you may have secured multiple offers from different universities in Singapore and overseas, and you will have to make an acceptance decision soon. But how should one decide? Every year, the Ministry of Education publishes the employment rates and median starting salaries of fresh graduates of the different degree programmes offered by local universities. I certainly hope students do not make decisions based solely on data obtained through the Graduate Employment Survey (GES). GES data provides an indication of starting salaries. Starting salaries are but a guide; they neither set the course nor determine one's career trajectory or destiny. In this volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous or "Vuca" world, one cannot predict the future or where the lucrative jobs will be. You would therefore want your university education to equip you with broad-based life skills, and develop you with the flexibility and resilience needed to pick up new knowledge, adapt to new circumstances, and exploit job opportunities across a variety of sectors throughout your lifetime of careers. Another consideration is whether and how the university course adds value to your educational journey. Some students (and parents) may look to university rankings as a measure of the strength of a university department. And there are definitely synergies between research and education. If the university department excels in research, and counts world-leading researchers in the field, it is likely that cutting-edge research will filter through to your learning experience. You will have the opportunity to be taught by highly regarded academics, and there will be plenty of opportunities to conduct research under the who's-who in the field. This is particularly valuable if you have a very strong interest in research or academia. Choosing a university that excels in your area of interest may also open up more specialised opportunities, such as advanced facilities, academic opportunities such as overseas study or research trips, as well as internships and employment opportunities with prestigious organisations in the industry. Beyond academic reputation, your choice of university will also affect your life intellectually, socially and professionally. You should evaluate the entire student experience, and whether it will suit you. Find out if the social setting on campus is what you would want to be part of. NUS has, for example, the Yale-NUS College and the University Town Residential College programmes, which offer an integrated living and learning experience, amid a collegial and intellectually vibrant setting. Another distinctive programme is the NUS Overseas Colleges programme, where students get to live, work and study in an entrepreneurial hub such as Silicon Valley, New York City or Stockholm, taking entrepreneurship classes at a partner university while working in promising entrepreneurial start-ups. All universities have carefully developed their own suite of programmes and it is worth your time and effort to find out what is on offer. Talk to the professors, and to current students. Universities hold Open Days and various outreach sessions where you can visit the campus and get first-hand information. The best-ranked university or the programme that offers you two degrees in the shortest duration may sound attractive, but they may not necessarily be what you are looking for.  Some of you may want an intensely academic experience, and to pick up as many degrees in the shortest possible time. Yet others may prefer to develop a broader range of capabilities, to try out new things, or to pursue more varied experiences. You should aim to identify a university and a course that best suits you, and not simply enrol in the most competitive or lucrative course. After all, you will be spending your next three to four years in this programme. For those of you whose grades may not meet the degree programme's published entry requirements, do not give up. All local universities have discretionary admissions schemes. Last year, NUS interviewed a record 1,600 students under the scheme, and admitted 670 students. This scheme allows universities to assess applicants more holistically, and to consider their passions and attributes such as leadership, resilience or entrepreneurial skills or talent in non-academic areas. The good news is that from the next academic year onwards, NUS, Nanyang Technological University and Singapore Management University can take in more students under the Discretionary Admissions Scheme, from 10 per cent of the annual intake currently, to up to 15 per cent. This will enable more students to enter universities on the basis of their strengths and talents, beyond academic performance. There is no perfect university. What is key is to make a considered decision with the resources and information that are available to you. Your degree should help start you on the journey to where you want to go. The knowledge, experiences and opportunities in your university life should also prepare you for life beyond your degree. As a student in Singapore, you will have up to the beginning of June to decide on your offers from most of the local universities. Whatever you eventually decide on, make the most of your university experience because, for many, it will be the best time of your life.",14.829153173214898

I was hoping to get some advice from you guys here. Firstly, Congrats to all those who have successful applications. To those who are still waiting, or got rejected, don't feel despair, i'm pretty sure you'll find your way out. Like a professional juggler once told me, his biggest lesson in juggling isn't any particular technically-advanced sleights, but this: "When the ball drops, pick it up." Simple, but means a lot. Now, my story: I am from the '94 batch. Took my A levels in 2012, flunk it really badly, because I was heavily distracted by relationship issues (broke up with my ex, which caused a whole landslide trail of problems. But that's another whole long story, and besides the point). I barely studied during A levels then, and entered the exam hall hoping to fail. But miraculously, i scraped through it, and wasn't allowed to retain in JC. The resultant problem: Straight C result, with one S grade. Devastatingly embarrassing, and was a crushing defeat. You see, I come from an IP school, and that technically means that, should I flunk my A levels, all i'm equivalent of is a Primary 6 standard. So here I am, half of my life, effectively erased on papers. I gone on to enlist in NS, and kept my report card hidden away in the "shameful" corner of my room, collecting dust. After NS, i decided to take a break, took a gap year, all these while, casting aside any thoughts on studies and the education system. I went on to completing 1 internship, and 2 other jobs, as well as backpacking around Europe, South East Asia and Australia. It was fulfilling, and definitely a worthwhile experience. But now, 3 years after receiving my poor A levels result, I finally decided to get back on to the system, and apply for university. Expectedly, even with DA (I was a former national athlete, and I had my employers write in recommendation letters), I was sorrowfully rejected. This time, it hit me hard, after all these years of "escaping", I was finally facing the music, and there and then i knew I had to do sth with my life to move on.TL;DR: I still want to enter university. I know i can do better than that "shitty" result i've got. So here's what I came for, hoping for someone to offer me some advice. Personally, I am contemplating on retaking A levels. My previous subject combination was PMEE. I know my science practical grades could no longer be used, so i have to go to a private institution to do it. I am considering going to MDIS and follow its system. (Question, does anybody have any experience or knowledge or advice on MDIS? Is it a good choice for me?) On top of that, I am intending on going for private tuition to brush up my skills, because i've heard that MDIS tutors aren't the best, or at least they aren't as good as JC MOE teachers. (So, does anybody know of any good 1-to-1 tutors, that could give you undivided attention?) Lastly, is anybody here intending to repeat A levels, I was hoping to form a study group of a couple students, and mug together, and we could encourage one another. This is my one shot, i'm giving my all, and keeping my head in the game. Thank you for reading, hope to get some responses. Really sorry to learn of your predicament. Im in a same situation as u, also from ip. Registration for re taking a levels this year as private candidate has alrdy ended. Have u tried applying to private unis such as sim? Im still waiting for smu and sim to get back to me. If all else fails, maybe we can retake together! If thats the case, i might change my combi to science instead of arts haha",14.372325656409052

The examples I highlighted below are simply the comments/questions that I spotted which inspired me to write this. I wouldn't want to start a discussion about education in Singapore here, nor would this a debate for JC vs Poly. Just a little background about myself - I was a comms student in poly, did pretty average for my GPA (3.5x), missed the uni application in my first year of army, got rejected by NTU ADM last year, finally got a late acceptance letter from ADM this year. So trust me when I say I can empathise with those who are still waiting for their acceptance letter, and why some people are asking certain questions here.Spoiler!Hi guys, care to give your opinions and views on SMU Business VS NUS Statistics?  Which one will have higher demand by employers? The answer to this is simple, ask yourself where do you want to work? MNC? Local startup? The big 4? Starting your own business? Government sector? The 'value' of a degree is only given to by the people looking at it. Even then, there are those companies in each category that would defy the stereotypical hiring policy. So my advice to the poster who asked this question is to define who are your said 'employers' first. If you have no idea where you want to work or which sector of business you want to be in, it might serve you better to understand more about the course to see which specific programme/school/school culture might suit you better rather which degree appeals more to 'employers'. It's better to make an informed choice yourself.Spoiler!Actually, people do look at where you study. I got a couple of friends in HR. They told me that they would also look at the university, course, GPA/grades, modules taken, then any leadership roles regardless of how many years of relevant work experience a person has. Some say they tend to give more priority to old boys/girls, alum, that sort of thing. I'm not saying you're wrong here buddy, and in fact you're correct in saying this! But like I mentioned previously, it depends on where you're applying for work at, what is the company's hiring policy, what are they looking for etc. Comments like this might mislead some to think that this one degree/choice of school will make or break their future. What your friends experienced are the hiring policies of their particular companies they work at, but it's definitely not the same across various companies.There's no 'one size fits all' answer to certain questions. There is also no 'only one single path' to success. Some students don't realise it yet. This is the point that I'm driving at - Students should not be afraid to seek out multiple answers to a single question. There is always more than one way to solve a single question. Isn't that how it is for Math too? There may be one solution given in the answer book but it doesn't mean that that's the only one.If you do not get your university placing in the public schools this year, there are many other options! For poly students, you can take a gap year and work first, try again next year or the year after, like what I was planning to do myself should I not get my placing this year. Work experience ain't a bad idea too. For JC students, you can always take the A's again (like what some here are planning to do), to get a better grade for your dream course on the next application. I had a friend who couldn't get pharmaceutical, retook his A's while serving NS, scored a much better grade and went on to pharmaceutical on a scholarship in the end. If you really want to study this year, then private schools might be a viable idea as well. Yes things might not have gone according to plan for you. You might have been taught your whole life that you must get into NTU/NUS/SMU, or that might have been pressure on yourself. But fact is, if you're not getting in (even after appeal), then it's on you to take your next step forward. You have to keep moving forward in life despite the obstacles you face. If you're really rejected in the end, allow yourself to be sad for a little while, then pick yourself up, make plans, take the next step forward and move on. You might have to take a little detour, but it doesn't mean you can't get there. It's just how badly you want it. I hope this lengthy post written at 3am in the morning would encourage some of you even a little, because I know what it's like to constantly fail at every turn and have life keep pushing you down. If it did, then I'm glad. ",13.914498946647969

SMU received 1,108 applications for the 45 places in the course, which means about 25 students are vying for every place. The demand for the new course has also led to a rise in total number of applications - 14,000 in all this year, a 6 per cent rise over last year. Earlier this year, when SMU announced the new course, its officials likened it to Oxford University's prestigious politics, philosophy and economics course. It is aimed at giving students a broad understanding of how the world works and will prepare them for a range of careers. Students who had applied for the course said it is an unusual combination since it includes the study of law with economics and politics - and prestigious to boot as it is being offered to only a select group of high-calibre students. Many were also drawn by the fact that the course would prepare them for a wide range of jobs, including in journalism, foreign affairs, public service, consulting and research. SMU provost Lily Kong said she was delighted with the response. She added: "From all our engagement sessions, it is clear that students, parents and employers recognise the value that the PLE combination of disciplines can bring in preparing graduates who can handle multifaceted careers... "Through a deeper understanding of how politics, law and economics intersect to shape the world in which we live, we hope to groom a new generation of leaders and thinkers for Singapore." The 45 students selected for the course will take all three subjects in the first year, before specialising in one of four areas - global studies, distribution and justice, public policy and governance, or choice and behaviour - from year two. Students will also have to go on a 10-week internship during which they will work on a project to find solutions to a real-world problem. SMU said several firms have indicated their interest in offering internships to those on the course. They include the Economic Development Board as well as consultancies like Bain and Company. SMU officials said close to 5,000 of the 14,000 applicants have been shortlisted so far. They will be further assessed via interviews. Professor Kong said that, besides academic results, SMU uses other criteria for admission. "Exam grades are a valid measure, but they cannot be the sole measure of a student's ability." The university is the first in Singapore to require all [shortlisted] candidates to attend an interview. It started the practice 16 years ago, when 2,000 students applied to become part of its pioneer batch. Interviews are still required now, although the number of candidates shortlisted for the six undergraduate degree courses has trebled. They are conducted individually or in groups, with professors on the lookout for intellectual curiosity and leadership qualities. SMU said a select group of students - about 1,000 - with strong academic and other abilities were invited to visit the university on "SMU Discovery Day" this year. Prof Kong said: "Our engagement is directed at confirming that they are indeed an excellent match for the education that SMU offers, and for them to confirm that SMU is the university of choice for them." A-level holder Benedict Lim, 20, who applied for the PLE course, said: "I have an interest in both (law and economics) and had a hard time picking one, so when I heard about SMU's new course, I jumped at the chance." He is keen on a broad-based education as he believes it will train him to be versatile and adaptable and enable him to switch careers. "You know what they say about students having to take on jobs that don't exist today. "I really do believe that. That's why it is best to have a broad-based education, so that you have a broad understanding of issues and how the world works." Probably an inflated nunber What they shld publish rather is the number of ppl putting that as their first choice at smu",13.257581219483185
2016,Singapore Management University|smu,Catholic Junior College|catholic jc|cjc|computer|com|infosys|information systems|analytics,"SINGAPORE: Three of Singapore's autonomous universities are refining the way they admit students under the Discretionary Admissions Scheme, which looks beyond a person's academic achievements. It comes as the universities prepare to take in more students under the scheme, when the current cap of 10 per cent allowed for discretionary admissions goes up to 15 per cent next year. ADVERTISING inRead invented by Teads National University of Singapore (NUS) is offering 7,000 places for the coming academic year, but it has received four times the number of applicants. While it has started handing out offers to those who made the cut based on their grades, about 1,800 students who did not are undergoing interviews to be considered for discretionary admissions this year. NUS has been evaluating and admitting more students under the scheme over the years. Last year, it evaluated 1,600 students, 400 more than 2014. 670 of them got in, 70 more than 2014. With more students expected to be considered for discretionary admissions, the process at NUS may be refined. Said Professor Tan Eng Chye, deputy president of academic affairs at NUS: “We are evolving; for instance, we have gotten alumni to help us with the interviews. I find that very useful because the alumni have a lot of experience in sizing up people and candidates, and they ask very useful questions. “We also provide more data on what to look out for and if the numbers get to be big, we may decide that maybe we can have sort of a test first - not an academic test per se, but perhaps a test to look at other non-academic aspects of that person. It could be an aptitude test.” Prof Tan added: “Exercising flexibility is one aspect; you also have to be fairly sharp on what to look for - it is not simply: 'OK, meet the numbers.' Our interest is to look for attributes of the applicants that would make the student community more interesting, more diversified, and enhance the interaction within the student community. “Those who can adequately and can eloquently convey their passions and interests - that would be advantageous. But we also have to look out for students who may not be able to communicate as well, but yet they have the potential for us to groom them to be able graduates.” At the Singapore Management University (SMU), discretionary admissions currently form about 5 to 8 per cent of the annual intake. With the higher cap of 15 per cent for such admissions next year, the university will have "more leeway" when assessing students. Professor Pang Yang Hoong, vice provost for undergraduate matters and student development at SMU, said: “For SMU, looking at students with other qualifications is not something terribly new because we always been holistic in the way we assess students and their suitability for admission. We will be more flexible. “(We look for) passion, the aptitude for the course for which we are admitting them into. It would also be ideal if students have demonstrated that they are successful to be in time management, that they also possess resilience and the ability to overcome difficult situations. This will help us to assess if that person has got the resilience and the determination to do well in the programme.” SMU is expecting more polytechnic graduates to apply through the discretionary route with the cap being raised to 15 per cent of the annual intake. Nanyang Technological University (NTU) will also "broaden the criteria", to give more people a shot at securing a place. It will favourably consider those who possess "enthusiasm and relevant work experience". Professor Kam Chan Hin, senior associate provost for undergraduate education at NTU, commented: “Normally, they will look at other achievements that they have - whether in sports, in arts … or even if they are very passionate about community service, leadership. So these are the things that we usually look for. “We are going to encourage all the schools to broaden the criteria, to allow more people who have a very strong passion, to be given the opportunity to be interviewed. We should be more adventurous, open it a bit more and ask more questions, outside of the usual parameters, and if you find somebody who is really very interesting and very passionate … give them a chance.” NTU had evaluated 1,400 students under the scheme last year and about 600 were given a place. All three universities said that even as they exercise flexibility, it is still important for students to show that they possess the "adequate academic competence" to go through the rigour and demands of a university education.  - CNA/ms",13.148333691613786

Why didn't you apply for Humanities & Social Studies instead? [Probing CCAs & Interests -2] 5. Why do you still want to choose NTU instead of NUS? [Universities Choice -3] Below are just my opinions. The interview ended surprisingly faster than expected - far less than 10 minutes. However, there were no questions related to assess my competency for ACBS, and I guess that these questions are completely the same as single degree interview. Also, I doubt they even know what I actually applied for. So for those who are applying ACBS as well, do rest assure.  Comparing NTU and SMU, I find that NTU is more rigid in the way they conduct their interviews. They seem to have a list of standardized questions to be asked. Whereas for SMU, after I spoken about my attachment in one of the Big 4, the whole conversation was all about the work I did, and how I was able to cope with stress in the environment. Very friendly professors. As such, it is much easier to control your conversation topic for SMU. Again, in my opinion, NTU is more interested in how you can contribute to NTU. Whilst for SMU, the professors really want to know you as an individual. Also, the interviewers in NTU seem to be expressionless; it feels that I was talking to robots, but at the very least they did hold eye contact with me. Both are equally efficient in conducting their interviews nevertheless. Generally agree with Aomatsu.  Just to add on, I went for the ACBS interview back in 2014, because, you know, NS, and the main interviewer was Prof Valerie. We had a rather entertaining conversation and it was more of a chit-chat session than an interview. NTU knows what courses you applied for. She had my application form in hard copy on the table (in full view) and asked me why I applied for REP as my 2nd choice, and only put Accountancy (single degree) as the 3rd choice. Other than that, the main focus was definitely on how I would contribute NTU if they offered me a place/scholarship. Of course I talked about joining some clubs in NBS, my career goals and the various competitions/events at NTU which interest me. They didn't ask me those "essay" kind of questions though, but we chatted for around 20 minutes. It was a very light-hearted and enjoyable session and it felt really short in fact. After the interview, the prof invited me to apply for the USP. I also went for the SMU interview (also in 2014) for the double degree programme in Accountancy and Business. I remember being interviewed by Prof Seow and Prof Gary Pan. They seemed really concerned about whether I applied to NUS/NTU and asked me which I would pick if I was offered all 3. It somehow gave me the impression that they were being insecure/desperate. However, I liked the fact that they gave more attention to my hobbies and interests and focused less on academic achievements. I guess this is one example of SMU's holistic admissions process. They were also constantly marketing their school throughout the interview by asking me if I knew that their school of accountancy was ranked xxx in the BYU rankings etc, and kept comparing them to the other 2 unis. What I got out of that interview was that the profs at SMU are really passionate about what they do and that they're incredibly driven especially when it comes to building the school's reputation.  At the end of the day, both are local universities. Employers will lump NUS/NTU/SMU together anyway. So in terms of employability, no difference really. Choose the school which suits your personality better.",13.142454713816718

2016,Singapore Management University|smu,Dunman High School|Dunman|dhs|computer|com|infosys|information systems|analytics,"Which university? Which course of study?Aim for a course that best suits you, rather than enrol in the most lucrative one Tan Eng Chye Prof Tan is deputy president (academic affairs) and provost at the National University of Singapore. PUBLISHED 6 HOURS AGOhttp://www.straitstimes.com/singapor...ourse-of-study The university admissions season is in full swing, and this is an exciting time for students in Singapore. The tertiary education landscape here has expanded significantly, and there are now many varied and interesting pathways for students to choose from, from traditional professional degree courses in medicine or engineering, to music and the liberal arts and science. Many parents I met at the National University of Singapore's (NUS) Open Day last month remarked that they are envious of the plethora of choices their children have, and wish to be young once more. Some of you may have secured multiple offers from different universities in Singapore and overseas, and you will have to make an acceptance decision soon. But how should one decide? Every year, the Ministry of Education publishes the employment rates and median starting salaries of fresh graduates of the different degree programmes offered by local universities. I certainly hope students do not make decisions based solely on data obtained through the Graduate Employment Survey (GES). GES data provides an indication of starting salaries. Starting salaries are but a guide; they neither set the course nor determine one's career trajectory or destiny. In this volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous or "Vuca" world, one cannot predict the future or where the lucrative jobs will be. You would therefore want your university education to equip you with broad-based life skills, and develop you with the flexibility and resilience needed to pick up new knowledge, adapt to new circumstances, and exploit job opportunities across a variety of sectors throughout your lifetime of careers. Another consideration is whether and how the university course adds value to your educational journey. Some students (and parents) may look to university rankings as a measure of the strength of a university department. And there are definitely synergies between research and education. If the university department excels in research, and counts world-leading researchers in the field, it is likely that cutting-edge research will filter through to your learning experience. You will have the opportunity to be taught by highly regarded academics, and there will be plenty of opportunities to conduct research under the who's-who in the field. This is particularly valuable if you have a very strong interest in research or academia. Choosing a university that excels in your area of interest may also open up more specialised opportunities, such as advanced facilities, academic opportunities such as overseas study or research trips, as well as internships and employment opportunities with prestigious organisations in the industry. Beyond academic reputation, your choice of university will also affect your life intellectually, socially and professionally. You should evaluate the entire student experience, and whether it will suit you. Find out if the social setting on campus is what you would want to be part of. NUS has, for example, the Yale-NUS College and the University Town Residential College programmes, which offer an integrated living and learning experience, amid a collegial and intellectually vibrant setting. Another distinctive programme is the NUS Overseas Colleges programme, where students get to live, work and study in an entrepreneurial hub such as Silicon Valley, New York City or Stockholm, taking entrepreneurship classes at a partner university while working in promising entrepreneurial start-ups. All universities have carefully developed their own suite of programmes and it is worth your time and effort to find out what is on offer. Talk to the professors, and to current students. Universities hold Open Days and various outreach sessions where you can visit the campus and get first-hand information. The best-ranked university or the programme that offers you two degrees in the shortest duration may sound attractive, but they may not necessarily be what you are looking for.  Some of you may want an intensely academic experience, and to pick up as many degrees in the shortest possible time. Yet others may prefer to develop a broader range of capabilities, to try out new things, or to pursue more varied experiences. You should aim to identify a university and a course that best suits you, and not simply enrol in the most competitive or lucrative course. After all, you will be spending your next three to four years in this programme. For those of you whose grades may not meet the degree programme's published entry requirements, do not give up. All local universities have discretionary admissions schemes. Last year, NUS interviewed a record 1,600 students under the scheme, and admitted 670 students. This scheme allows universities to assess applicants more holistically, and to consider their passions and attributes such as leadership, resilience or entrepreneurial skills or talent in non-academic areas. The good news is that from the next academic year onwards, NUS, Nanyang Technological University and Singapore Management University can take in more students under the Discretionary Admissions Scheme, from 10 per cent of the annual intake currently, to up to 15 per cent. This will enable more students to enter universities on the basis of their strengths and talents, beyond academic performance. There is no perfect university. What is key is to make a considered decision with the resources and information that are available to you. Your degree should help start you on the journey to where you want to go. The knowledge, experiences and opportunities in your university life should also prepare you for life beyond your degree. As a student in Singapore, you will have up to the beginning of June to decide on your offers from most of the local universities. Whatever you eventually decide on, make the most of your university experience because, for many, it will be the best time of your life.",14.829153173214898

I was hoping to get some advice from you guys here. Firstly, Congrats to all those who have successful applications. To those who are still waiting, or got rejected, don't feel despair, i'm pretty sure you'll find your way out. Like a professional juggler once told me, his biggest lesson in juggling isn't any particular technically-advanced sleights, but this: "When the ball drops, pick it up." Simple, but means a lot. Now, my story: I am from the '94 batch. Took my A levels in 2012, flunk it really badly, because I was heavily distracted by relationship issues (broke up with my ex, which caused a whole landslide trail of problems. But that's another whole long story, and besides the point). I barely studied during A levels then, and entered the exam hall hoping to fail. But miraculously, i scraped through it, and wasn't allowed to retain in JC. The resultant problem: Straight C result, with one S grade. Devastatingly embarrassing, and was a crushing defeat. You see, I come from an IP school, and that technically means that, should I flunk my A levels, all i'm equivalent of is a Primary 6 standard. So here I am, half of my life, effectively erased on papers. I gone on to enlist in NS, and kept my report card hidden away in the "shameful" corner of my room, collecting dust. After NS, i decided to take a break, took a gap year, all these while, casting aside any thoughts on studies and the education system. I went on to completing 1 internship, and 2 other jobs, as well as backpacking around Europe, South East Asia and Australia. It was fulfilling, and definitely a worthwhile experience. But now, 3 years after receiving my poor A levels result, I finally decided to get back on to the system, and apply for university. Expectedly, even with DA (I was a former national athlete, and I had my employers write in recommendation letters), I was sorrowfully rejected. This time, it hit me hard, after all these years of "escaping", I was finally facing the music, and there and then i knew I had to do sth with my life to move on.TL;DR: I still want to enter university. I know i can do better than that "shitty" result i've got. So here's what I came for, hoping for someone to offer me some advice. Personally, I am contemplating on retaking A levels. My previous subject combination was PMEE. I know my science practical grades could no longer be used, so i have to go to a private institution to do it. I am considering going to MDIS and follow its system. (Question, does anybody have any experience or knowledge or advice on MDIS? Is it a good choice for me?) On top of that, I am intending on going for private tuition to brush up my skills, because i've heard that MDIS tutors aren't the best, or at least they aren't as good as JC MOE teachers. (So, does anybody know of any good 1-to-1 tutors, that could give you undivided attention?) Lastly, is anybody here intending to repeat A levels, I was hoping to form a study group of a couple students, and mug together, and we could encourage one another. This is my one shot, i'm giving my all, and keeping my head in the game. Thank you for reading, hope to get some responses. Really sorry to learn of your predicament. Im in a same situation as u, also from ip. Registration for re taking a levels this year as private candidate has alrdy ended. Have u tried applying to private unis such as sim? Im still waiting for smu and sim to get back to me. If all else fails, maybe we can retake together! If thats the case, i might change my combi to science instead of arts haha",14.372325656409052
2016,Singapore Management University|smu,Dunman High School|Dunman|dhs|computer|com|infosys|information systems|analytics,"DISCLAIMER: I'd like to say that this post is not meant to flame anyone or put a negative spotlight on anyone. The examples I highlighted below are simply the comments/questions that I spotted which inspired me to write this. I wouldn't want to start a discussion about education in Singapore here, nor would this a debate for JC vs Poly. Just a little background about myself - I was a comms student in poly, did pretty average for my GPA (3.5x), missed the uni application in my first year of army, got rejected by NTU ADM last year, finally got a late acceptance letter from ADM this year. So trust me when I say I can empathise with those who are still waiting for their acceptance letter, and why some people are asking certain questions here.Spoiler!Hi guys, care to give your opinions and views on SMU Business VS NUS Statistics?  Which one will have higher demand by employers? The answer to this is simple, ask yourself where do you want to work? MNC? Local startup? The big 4? Starting your own business? Government sector? The 'value' of a degree is only given to by the people looking at it. Even then, there are those companies in each category that would defy the stereotypical hiring policy. So my advice to the poster who asked this question is to define who are your said 'employers' first. If you have no idea where you want to work or which sector of business you want to be in, it might serve you better to understand more about the course to see which specific programme/school/school culture might suit you better rather which degree appeals more to 'employers'. It's better to make an informed choice yourself.Spoiler!Actually, people do look at where you study. I got a couple of friends in HR. They told me that they would also look at the university, course, GPA/grades, modules taken, then any leadership roles regardless of how many years of relevant work experience a person has. Some say they tend to give more priority to old boys/girls, alum, that sort of thing. I'm not saying you're wrong here buddy, and in fact you're correct in saying this! But like I mentioned previously, it depends on where you're applying for work at, what is the company's hiring policy, what are they looking for etc. Comments like this might mislead some to think that this one degree/choice of school will make or break their future. What your friends experienced are the hiring policies of their particular companies they work at, but it's definitely not the same across various companies.There's no 'one size fits all' answer to certain questions. There is also no 'only one single path' to success. Some students don't realise it yet. This is the point that I'm driving at - Students should not be afraid to seek out multiple answers to a single question. There is always more than one way to solve a single question. Isn't that how it is for Math too? There may be one solution given in the answer book but it doesn't mean that that's the only one.If you do not get your university placing in the public schools this year, there are many other options! For poly students, you can take a gap year and work first, try again next year or the year after, like what I was planning to do myself should I not get my placing this year. Work experience ain't a bad idea too. For JC students, you can always take the A's again (like what some here are planning to do), to get a better grade for your dream course on the next application. I had a friend who couldn't get pharmaceutical, retook his A's while serving NS, scored a much better grade and went on to pharmaceutical on a scholarship in the end. If you really want to study this year, then private schools might be a viable idea as well. Yes things might not have gone according to plan for you. You might have been taught your whole life that you must get into NTU/NUS/SMU, or that might have been pressure on yourself. But fact is, if you're not getting in (even after appeal), then it's on you to take your next step forward. You have to keep moving forward in life despite the obstacles you face. If you're really rejected in the end, allow yourself to be sad for a little while, then pick yourself up, make plans, take the next step forward and move on. You might have to take a little detour, but it doesn't mean you can't get there. It's just how badly you want it. I hope this lengthy post written at 3am in the morning would encourage some of you even a little, because I know what it's like to constantly fail at every turn and have life keep pushing you down. If it did, then I'm glad. ",13.914498946647969

SMU received 1,108 applications for the 45 places in the course, which means about 25 students are vying for every place. The demand for the new course has also led to a rise in total number of applications - 14,000 in all this year, a 6 per cent rise over last year. Earlier this year, when SMU announced the new course, its officials likened it to Oxford University's prestigious politics, philosophy and economics course. It is aimed at giving students a broad understanding of how the world works and will prepare them for a range of careers. Students who had applied for the course said it is an unusual combination since it includes the study of law with economics and politics - and prestigious to boot as it is being offered to only a select group of high-calibre students. Many were also drawn by the fact that the course would prepare them for a wide range of jobs, including in journalism, foreign affairs, public service, consulting and research. SMU provost Lily Kong said she was delighted with the response. She added: "From all our engagement sessions, it is clear that students, parents and employers recognise the value that the PLE combination of disciplines can bring in preparing graduates who can handle multifaceted careers... "Through a deeper understanding of how politics, law and economics intersect to shape the world in which we live, we hope to groom a new generation of leaders and thinkers for Singapore." The 45 students selected for the course will take all three subjects in the first year, before specialising in one of four areas - global studies, distribution and justice, public policy and governance, or choice and behaviour - from year two. Students will also have to go on a 10-week internship during which they will work on a project to find solutions to a real-world problem. SMU said several firms have indicated their interest in offering internships to those on the course. They include the Economic Development Board as well as consultancies like Bain and Company. SMU officials said close to 5,000 of the 14,000 applicants have been shortlisted so far. They will be further assessed via interviews. Professor Kong said that, besides academic results, SMU uses other criteria for admission. "Exam grades are a valid measure, but they cannot be the sole measure of a student's ability." The university is the first in Singapore to require all [shortlisted] candidates to attend an interview. It started the practice 16 years ago, when 2,000 students applied to become part of its pioneer batch. Interviews are still required now, although the number of candidates shortlisted for the six undergraduate degree courses has trebled. They are conducted individually or in groups, with professors on the lookout for intellectual curiosity and leadership qualities. SMU said a select group of students - about 1,000 - with strong academic and other abilities were invited to visit the university on "SMU Discovery Day" this year. Prof Kong said: "Our engagement is directed at confirming that they are indeed an excellent match for the education that SMU offers, and for them to confirm that SMU is the university of choice for them." A-level holder Benedict Lim, 20, who applied for the PLE course, said: "I have an interest in both (law and economics) and had a hard time picking one, so when I heard about SMU's new course, I jumped at the chance." He is keen on a broad-based education as he believes it will train him to be versatile and adaptable and enable him to switch careers. "You know what they say about students having to take on jobs that don't exist today. "I really do believe that. That's why it is best to have a broad-based education, so that you have a broad understanding of issues and how the world works." Probably an inflated nunber What they shld publish rather is the number of ppl putting that as their first choice at smu",13.257581219483185
2016,Singapore Management University|smu,Dunman High School|Dunman|dhs|computer|com|infosys|information systems|analytics,"SINGAPORE: Three of Singapore's autonomous universities are refining the way they admit students under the Discretionary Admissions Scheme, which looks beyond a person's academic achievements. It comes as the universities prepare to take in more students under the scheme, when the current cap of 10 per cent allowed for discretionary admissions goes up to 15 per cent next year. ADVERTISING inRead invented by Teads National University of Singapore (NUS) is offering 7,000 places for the coming academic year, but it has received four times the number of applicants. While it has started handing out offers to those who made the cut based on their grades, about 1,800 students who did not are undergoing interviews to be considered for discretionary admissions this year. NUS has been evaluating and admitting more students under the scheme over the years. Last year, it evaluated 1,600 students, 400 more than 2014. 670 of them got in, 70 more than 2014. With more students expected to be considered for discretionary admissions, the process at NUS may be refined. Said Professor Tan Eng Chye, deputy president of academic affairs at NUS: “We are evolving; for instance, we have gotten alumni to help us with the interviews. I find that very useful because the alumni have a lot of experience in sizing up people and candidates, and they ask very useful questions. “We also provide more data on what to look out for and if the numbers get to be big, we may decide that maybe we can have sort of a test first - not an academic test per se, but perhaps a test to look at other non-academic aspects of that person. It could be an aptitude test.” Prof Tan added: “Exercising flexibility is one aspect; you also have to be fairly sharp on what to look for - it is not simply: 'OK, meet the numbers.' Our interest is to look for attributes of the applicants that would make the student community more interesting, more diversified, and enhance the interaction within the student community. “Those who can adequately and can eloquently convey their passions and interests - that would be advantageous. But we also have to look out for students who may not be able to communicate as well, but yet they have the potential for us to groom them to be able graduates.” At the Singapore Management University (SMU), discretionary admissions currently form about 5 to 8 per cent of the annual intake. With the higher cap of 15 per cent for such admissions next year, the university will have "more leeway" when assessing students. Professor Pang Yang Hoong, vice provost for undergraduate matters and student development at SMU, said: “For SMU, looking at students with other qualifications is not something terribly new because we always been holistic in the way we assess students and their suitability for admission. We will be more flexible. “(We look for) passion, the aptitude for the course for which we are admitting them into. It would also be ideal if students have demonstrated that they are successful to be in time management, that they also possess resilience and the ability to overcome difficult situations. This will help us to assess if that person has got the resilience and the determination to do well in the programme.” SMU is expecting more polytechnic graduates to apply through the discretionary route with the cap being raised to 15 per cent of the annual intake. Nanyang Technological University (NTU) will also "broaden the criteria", to give more people a shot at securing a place. It will favourably consider those who possess "enthusiasm and relevant work experience". Professor Kam Chan Hin, senior associate provost for undergraduate education at NTU, commented: “Normally, they will look at other achievements that they have - whether in sports, in arts … or even if they are very passionate about community service, leadership. So these are the things that we usually look for. “We are going to encourage all the schools to broaden the criteria, to allow more people who have a very strong passion, to be given the opportunity to be interviewed. We should be more adventurous, open it a bit more and ask more questions, outside of the usual parameters, and if you find somebody who is really very interesting and very passionate … give them a chance.” NTU had evaluated 1,400 students under the scheme last year and about 600 were given a place. All three universities said that even as they exercise flexibility, it is still important for students to show that they possess the "adequate academic competence" to go through the rigour and demands of a university education.  - CNA/ms",13.148333691613786

Describe yourself. 2. Why do you think we should accept you? How can you contribute to NTU? 3. Did you apply in other Universities as well?Probing Questions 1. Describe yourself in 2 sentences.

Why didn't you apply for Humanities & Social Studies instead? [Probing CCAs & Interests -2] 5. Why do you still want to choose NTU instead of NUS? [Universities Choice -3] Below are just my opinions. The interview ended surprisingly faster than expected - far less than 10 minutes. However, there were no questions related to assess my competency for ACBS, and I guess that these questions are completely the same as single degree interview. Also, I doubt they even know what I actually applied for. So for those who are applying ACBS as well, do rest assure.  Comparing NTU and SMU, I find that NTU is more rigid in the way they conduct their interviews. They seem to have a list of standardized questions to be asked. Whereas for SMU, after I spoken about my attachment in one of the Big 4, the whole conversation was all about the work I did, and how I was able to cope with stress in the environment. Very friendly professors. As such, it is much easier to control your conversation topic for SMU. Again, in my opinion, NTU is more interested in how you can contribute to NTU. Whilst for SMU, the professors really want to know you as an individual. Also, the interviewers in NTU seem to be expressionless; it feels that I was talking to robots, but at the very least they did hold eye contact with me. Both are equally efficient in conducting their interviews nevertheless. Generally agree with Aomatsu.  Just to add on, I went for the ACBS interview back in 2014, because, you know, NS, and the main interviewer was Prof Valerie. We had a rather entertaining conversation and it was more of a chit-chat session than an interview. NTU knows what courses you applied for. She had my application form in hard copy on the table (in full view) and asked me why I applied for REP as my 2nd choice, and only put Accountancy (single degree) as the 3rd choice. Other than that, the main focus was definitely on how I would contribute NTU if they offered me a place/scholarship. Of course I talked about joining some clubs in NBS, my career goals and the various competitions/events at NTU which interest me. They didn't ask me those "essay" kind of questions though, but we chatted for around 20 minutes. It was a very light-hearted and enjoyable session and it felt really short in fact. After the interview, the prof invited me to apply for the USP. I also went for the SMU interview (also in 2014) for the double degree programme in Accountancy and Business. I remember being interviewed by Prof Seow and Prof Gary Pan. They seemed really concerned about whether I applied to NUS/NTU and asked me which I would pick if I was offered all 3. It somehow gave me the impression that they were being insecure/desperate. However, I liked the fact that they gave more attention to my hobbies and interests and focused less on academic achievements. I guess this is one example of SMU's holistic admissions process. They were also constantly marketing their school throughout the interview by asking me if I knew that their school of accountancy was ranked xxx in the BYU rankings etc, and kept comparing them to the other 2 unis. What I got out of that interview was that the profs at SMU are really passionate about what they do and that they're incredibly driven especially when it comes to building the school's reputation.  At the end of the day, both are local universities. Employers will lump NUS/NTU/SMU together anyway. So in terms of employability, no difference really. Choose the school which suits your personality better.",13.142454713816718

Eat in balance, avoid eating stuff that will float your bloat, which are dairy products for me. I had tori katsu curry rice at umisushi, best $4.90 spent. 2. Eat whole fruits after lunch to regulate your blood sugar so you won't feel that sleepy. I ate papaya, banana or dragonfruits etc... 3. If you are a coffee jittery person, do not drink highly caffeinated beverages, such as myself  4. Try to keep your body calm, staying in aircon area works for me, because when I'm sweaty, I cannot focus. When I reached Bras Basah MRT, I couldn't quite find SIS, until I saw Subway ads, it says "Subway @ School of Information System *arrow*". Told the security personnel at the gantry that I'm here for interview, and she guided me to the lift Went up, signage were on walls and doors to guide me to a hole in a wall, where I was requested to complete a style-of-work survey (no right and wrong answer, just to see what is your working style) and waited for my turn. Diagonal to me sits another dude, cool dude who has Korean blood  we were guided by 2 presumably seniors into a room to do 2 things:  A) Stanford Karel; we were tasked to script a simple program. B) Estimation question; How many visitors land on plane in Singapore on Dec 2015? After we completed the two tasks, we were guided to a holding room with promotional videoes playing, anyone notice that SIS dean looks like the late Steve Job?  We waited about 20mins before the interview with presumably professors, Prof. Benjamin Gan and another lady professor We were asked to explain how we coded the script for Karel, and how we arrived at the estimated number for the estimation question Then the professors asked us some questions, "Why join SIS?", "If half way through the course, you lost interest in studying SIS then how?" Etc... Overall the interview lasted an hour, I arrived at 1.30pm, waited till 2pm before I started, and left exactly at 3pm. Hope this is a good reference for ya'll out there, do PM me if you got into SIS too! Can do projects together!",12.260833965244545
2016,Singapore Management University|smu,Eunoia Junior College|Eunoia jc|ejc|computer|com|infosys|information systems|analytics,"Which university? Which course of study?Aim for a course that best suits you, rather than enrol in the most lucrative one Tan Eng Chye Prof Tan is deputy president (academic affairs) and provost at the National University of Singapore. PUBLISHED 6 HOURS AGOhttp://www.straitstimes.com/singapor...ourse-of-study The university admissions season is in full swing, and this is an exciting time for students in Singapore. The tertiary education landscape here has expanded significantly, and there are now many varied and interesting pathways for students to choose from, from traditional professional degree courses in medicine or engineering, to music and the liberal arts and science. Many parents I met at the National University of Singapore's (NUS) Open Day last month remarked that they are envious of the plethora of choices their children have, and wish to be young once more. Some of you may have secured multiple offers from different universities in Singapore and overseas, and you will have to make an acceptance decision soon. But how should one decide? Every year, the Ministry of Education publishes the employment rates and median starting salaries of fresh graduates of the different degree programmes offered by local universities. I certainly hope students do not make decisions based solely on data obtained through the Graduate Employment Survey (GES). GES data provides an indication of starting salaries. Starting salaries are but a guide; they neither set the course nor determine one's career trajectory or destiny. In this volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous or "Vuca" world, one cannot predict the future or where the lucrative jobs will be. You would therefore want your university education to equip you with broad-based life skills, and develop you with the flexibility and resilience needed to pick up new knowledge, adapt to new circumstances, and exploit job opportunities across a variety of sectors throughout your lifetime of careers. Another consideration is whether and how the university course adds value to your educational journey. Some students (and parents) may look to university rankings as a measure of the strength of a university department. And there are definitely synergies between research and education. If the university department excels in research, and counts world-leading researchers in the field, it is likely that cutting-edge research will filter through to your learning experience. You will have the opportunity to be taught by highly regarded academics, and there will be plenty of opportunities to conduct research under the who's-who in the field. This is particularly valuable if you have a very strong interest in research or academia. Choosing a university that excels in your area of interest may also open up more specialised opportunities, such as advanced facilities, academic opportunities such as overseas study or research trips, as well as internships and employment opportunities with prestigious organisations in the industry. Beyond academic reputation, your choice of university will also affect your life intellectually, socially and professionally. You should evaluate the entire student experience, and whether it will suit you. Find out if the social setting on campus is what you would want to be part of. NUS has, for example, the Yale-NUS College and the University Town Residential College programmes, which offer an integrated living and learning experience, amid a collegial and intellectually vibrant setting. Another distinctive programme is the NUS Overseas Colleges programme, where students get to live, work and study in an entrepreneurial hub such as Silicon Valley, New York City or Stockholm, taking entrepreneurship classes at a partner university while working in promising entrepreneurial start-ups. All universities have carefully developed their own suite of programmes and it is worth your time and effort to find out what is on offer. Talk to the professors, and to current students. Universities hold Open Days and various outreach sessions where you can visit the campus and get first-hand information. The best-ranked university or the programme that offers you two degrees in the shortest duration may sound attractive, but they may not necessarily be what you are looking for.  Some of you may want an intensely academic experience, and to pick up as many degrees in the shortest possible time. Yet others may prefer to develop a broader range of capabilities, to try out new things, or to pursue more varied experiences. You should aim to identify a university and a course that best suits you, and not simply enrol in the most competitive or lucrative course. After all, you will be spending your next three to four years in this programme. For those of you whose grades may not meet the degree programme's published entry requirements, do not give up. All local universities have discretionary admissions schemes. Last year, NUS interviewed a record 1,600 students under the scheme, and admitted 670 students. This scheme allows universities to assess applicants more holistically, and to consider their passions and attributes such as leadership, resilience or entrepreneurial skills or talent in non-academic areas. The good news is that from the next academic year onwards, NUS, Nanyang Technological University and Singapore Management University can take in more students under the Discretionary Admissions Scheme, from 10 per cent of the annual intake currently, to up to 15 per cent. This will enable more students to enter universities on the basis of their strengths and talents, beyond academic performance. There is no perfect university. What is key is to make a considered decision with the resources and information that are available to you. Your degree should help start you on the journey to where you want to go. The knowledge, experiences and opportunities in your university life should also prepare you for life beyond your degree. As a student in Singapore, you will have up to the beginning of June to decide on your offers from most of the local universities. Whatever you eventually decide on, make the most of your university experience because, for many, it will be the best time of your life.",14.829153173214898

I was hoping to get some advice from you guys here. Firstly, Congrats to all those who have successful applications. To those who are still waiting, or got rejected, don't feel despair, i'm pretty sure you'll find your way out. Like a professional juggler once told me, his biggest lesson in juggling isn't any particular technically-advanced sleights, but this: "When the ball drops, pick it up." Simple, but means a lot. Now, my story: I am from the '94 batch. Took my A levels in 2012, flunk it really badly, because I was heavily distracted by relationship issues (broke up with my ex, which caused a whole landslide trail of problems. But that's another whole long story, and besides the point). I barely studied during A levels then, and entered the exam hall hoping to fail. But miraculously, i scraped through it, and wasn't allowed to retain in JC. The resultant problem: Straight C result, with one S grade. Devastatingly embarrassing, and was a crushing defeat. You see, I come from an IP school, and that technically means that, should I flunk my A levels, all i'm equivalent of is a Primary 6 standard. So here I am, half of my life, effectively erased on papers. I gone on to enlist in NS, and kept my report card hidden away in the "shameful" corner of my room, collecting dust. After NS, i decided to take a break, took a gap year, all these while, casting aside any thoughts on studies and the education system. I went on to completing 1 internship, and 2 other jobs, as well as backpacking around Europe, South East Asia and Australia. It was fulfilling, and definitely a worthwhile experience. But now, 3 years after receiving my poor A levels result, I finally decided to get back on to the system, and apply for university. Expectedly, even with DA (I was a former national athlete, and I had my employers write in recommendation letters), I was sorrowfully rejected. This time, it hit me hard, after all these years of "escaping", I was finally facing the music, and there and then i knew I had to do sth with my life to move on.TL;DR: I still want to enter university. I know i can do better than that "shitty" result i've got. So here's what I came for, hoping for someone to offer me some advice. Personally, I am contemplating on retaking A levels. My previous subject combination was PMEE. I know my science practical grades could no longer be used, so i have to go to a private institution to do it. I am considering going to MDIS and follow its system. (Question, does anybody have any experience or knowledge or advice on MDIS? Is it a good choice for me?) On top of that, I am intending on going for private tuition to brush up my skills, because i've heard that MDIS tutors aren't the best, or at least they aren't as good as JC MOE teachers. (So, does anybody know of any good 1-to-1 tutors, that could give you undivided attention?) Lastly, is anybody here intending to repeat A levels, I was hoping to form a study group of a couple students, and mug together, and we could encourage one another. This is my one shot, i'm giving my all, and keeping my head in the game. Thank you for reading, hope to get some responses. Really sorry to learn of your predicament. Im in a same situation as u, also from ip. Registration for re taking a levels this year as private candidate has alrdy ended. Have u tried applying to private unis such as sim? Im still waiting for smu and sim to get back to me. If all else fails, maybe we can retake together! If thats the case, i might change my combi to science instead of arts haha",14.372325656409052
2016,Singapore Management University|smu,Eunoia Junior College|Eunoia jc|ejc|computer|com|infosys|information systems|analytics,"DISCLAIMER: I'd like to say that this post is not meant to flame anyone or put a negative spotlight on anyone. The examples I highlighted below are simply the comments/questions that I spotted which inspired me to write this. I wouldn't want to start a discussion about education in Singapore here, nor would this a debate for JC vs Poly. Just a little background about myself - I was a comms student in poly, did pretty average for my GPA (3.5x), missed the uni application in my first year of army, got rejected by NTU ADM last year, finally got a late acceptance letter from ADM this year. So trust me when I say I can empathise with those who are still waiting for their acceptance letter, and why some people are asking certain questions here.Spoiler!Hi guys, care to give your opinions and views on SMU Business VS NUS Statistics?  Which one will have higher demand by employers? The answer to this is simple, ask yourself where do you want to work? MNC? Local startup? The big 4? Starting your own business? Government sector? The 'value' of a degree is only given to by the people looking at it. Even then, there are those companies in each category that would defy the stereotypical hiring policy. So my advice to the poster who asked this question is to define who are your said 'employers' first. If you have no idea where you want to work or which sector of business you want to be in, it might serve you better to understand more about the course to see which specific programme/school/school culture might suit you better rather which degree appeals more to 'employers'. It's better to make an informed choice yourself.Spoiler!Actually, people do look at where you study. I got a couple of friends in HR. They told me that they would also look at the university, course, GPA/grades, modules taken, then any leadership roles regardless of how many years of relevant work experience a person has. Some say they tend to give more priority to old boys/girls, alum, that sort of thing. I'm not saying you're wrong here buddy, and in fact you're correct in saying this! But like I mentioned previously, it depends on where you're applying for work at, what is the company's hiring policy, what are they looking for etc. Comments like this might mislead some to think that this one degree/choice of school will make or break their future. What your friends experienced are the hiring policies of their particular companies they work at, but it's definitely not the same across various companies.There's no 'one size fits all' answer to certain questions. There is also no 'only one single path' to success. Some students don't realise it yet. This is the point that I'm driving at - Students should not be afraid to seek out multiple answers to a single question. There is always more than one way to solve a single question. Isn't that how it is for Math too? There may be one solution given in the answer book but it doesn't mean that that's the only one.If you do not get your university placing in the public schools this year, there are many other options! For poly students, you can take a gap year and work first, try again next year or the year after, like what I was planning to do myself should I not get my placing this year. Work experience ain't a bad idea too. For JC students, you can always take the A's again (like what some here are planning to do), to get a better grade for your dream course on the next application. I had a friend who couldn't get pharmaceutical, retook his A's while serving NS, scored a much better grade and went on to pharmaceutical on a scholarship in the end. If you really want to study this year, then private schools might be a viable idea as well. Yes things might not have gone according to plan for you. You might have been taught your whole life that you must get into NTU/NUS/SMU, or that might have been pressure on yourself. But fact is, if you're not getting in (even after appeal), then it's on you to take your next step forward. You have to keep moving forward in life despite the obstacles you face. If you're really rejected in the end, allow yourself to be sad for a little while, then pick yourself up, make plans, take the next step forward and move on. You might have to take a little detour, but it doesn't mean you can't get there. It's just how badly you want it. I hope this lengthy post written at 3am in the morning would encourage some of you even a little, because I know what it's like to constantly fail at every turn and have life keep pushing you down. If it did, then I'm glad. ",13.914498946647969

SMU received 1,108 applications for the 45 places in the course, which means about 25 students are vying for every place. The demand for the new course has also led to a rise in total number of applications - 14,000 in all this year, a 6 per cent rise over last year. Earlier this year, when SMU announced the new course, its officials likened it to Oxford University's prestigious politics, philosophy and economics course. It is aimed at giving students a broad understanding of how the world works and will prepare them for a range of careers. Students who had applied for the course said it is an unusual combination since it includes the study of law with economics and politics - and prestigious to boot as it is being offered to only a select group of high-calibre students. Many were also drawn by the fact that the course would prepare them for a wide range of jobs, including in journalism, foreign affairs, public service, consulting and research. SMU provost Lily Kong said she was delighted with the response. She added: "From all our engagement sessions, it is clear that students, parents and employers recognise the value that the PLE combination of disciplines can bring in preparing graduates who can handle multifaceted careers... "Through a deeper understanding of how politics, law and economics intersect to shape the world in which we live, we hope to groom a new generation of leaders and thinkers for Singapore." The 45 students selected for the course will take all three subjects in the first year, before specialising in one of four areas - global studies, distribution and justice, public policy and governance, or choice and behaviour - from year two. Students will also have to go on a 10-week internship during which they will work on a project to find solutions to a real-world problem. SMU said several firms have indicated their interest in offering internships to those on the course. They include the Economic Development Board as well as consultancies like Bain and Company. SMU officials said close to 5,000 of the 14,000 applicants have been shortlisted so far. They will be further assessed via interviews. Professor Kong said that, besides academic results, SMU uses other criteria for admission. "Exam grades are a valid measure, but they cannot be the sole measure of a student's ability." The university is the first in Singapore to require all [shortlisted] candidates to attend an interview. It started the practice 16 years ago, when 2,000 students applied to become part of its pioneer batch. Interviews are still required now, although the number of candidates shortlisted for the six undergraduate degree courses has trebled. They are conducted individually or in groups, with professors on the lookout for intellectual curiosity and leadership qualities. SMU said a select group of students - about 1,000 - with strong academic and other abilities were invited to visit the university on "SMU Discovery Day" this year. Prof Kong said: "Our engagement is directed at confirming that they are indeed an excellent match for the education that SMU offers, and for them to confirm that SMU is the university of choice for them." A-level holder Benedict Lim, 20, who applied for the PLE course, said: "I have an interest in both (law and economics) and had a hard time picking one, so when I heard about SMU's new course, I jumped at the chance." He is keen on a broad-based education as he believes it will train him to be versatile and adaptable and enable him to switch careers. "You know what they say about students having to take on jobs that don't exist today. "I really do believe that. That's why it is best to have a broad-based education, so that you have a broad understanding of issues and how the world works."

2016,Singapore Management University|smu,Eunoia Junior College|Eunoia jc|ejc|computer|com|infosys|information systems|analytics,"SINGAPORE: Three of Singapore's autonomous universities are refining the way they admit students under the Discretionary Admissions Scheme, which looks beyond a person's academic achievements. It comes as the universities prepare to take in more students under the scheme, when the current cap of 10 per cent allowed for discretionary admissions goes up to 15 per cent next year. ADVERTISING inRead invented by Teads National University of Singapore (NUS) is offering 7,000 places for the coming academic year, but it has received four times the number of applicants. While it has started handing out offers to those who made the cut based on their grades, about 1,800 students who did not are undergoing interviews to be considered for discretionary admissions this year. NUS has been evaluating and admitting more students under the scheme over the years. Last year, it evaluated 1,600 students, 400 more than 2014. 670 of them got in, 70 more than 2014. With more students expected to be considered for discretionary admissions, the process at NUS may be refined. Said Professor Tan Eng Chye, deputy president of academic affairs at NUS: “We are evolving; for instance, we have gotten alumni to help us with the interviews. I find that very useful because the alumni have a lot of experience in sizing up people and candidates, and they ask very useful questions. “We also provide more data on what to look out for and if the numbers get to be big, we may decide that maybe we can have sort of a test first - not an academic test per se, but perhaps a test to look at other non-academic aspects of that person. It could be an aptitude test.” Prof Tan added: “Exercising flexibility is one aspect; you also have to be fairly sharp on what to look for - it is not simply: 'OK, meet the numbers.' Our interest is to look for attributes of the applicants that would make the student community more interesting, more diversified, and enhance the interaction within the student community. “Those who can adequately and can eloquently convey their passions and interests - that would be advantageous. But we also have to look out for students who may not be able to communicate as well, but yet they have the potential for us to groom them to be able graduates.” At the Singapore Management University (SMU), discretionary admissions currently form about 5 to 8 per cent of the annual intake. With the higher cap of 15 per cent for such admissions next year, the university will have "more leeway" when assessing students. Professor Pang Yang Hoong, vice provost for undergraduate matters and student development at SMU, said: “For SMU, looking at students with other qualifications is not something terribly new because we always been holistic in the way we assess students and their suitability for admission. We will be more flexible. “(We look for) passion, the aptitude for the course for which we are admitting them into. It would also be ideal if students have demonstrated that they are successful to be in time management, that they also possess resilience and the ability to overcome difficult situations. This will help us to assess if that person has got the resilience and the determination to do well in the programme.” SMU is expecting more polytechnic graduates to apply through the discretionary route with the cap being raised to 15 per cent of the annual intake. Nanyang Technological University (NTU) will also "broaden the criteria", to give more people a shot at securing a place. It will favourably consider those who possess "enthusiasm and relevant work experience". Professor Kam Chan Hin, senior associate provost for undergraduate education at NTU, commented: “Normally, they will look at other achievements that they have - whether in sports, in arts … or even if they are very passionate about community service, leadership. So these are the things that we usually look for. “We are going to encourage all the schools to broaden the criteria, to allow more people who have a very strong passion, to be given the opportunity to be interviewed. We should be more adventurous, open it a bit more and ask more questions, outside of the usual parameters, and if you find somebody who is really very interesting and very passionate … give them a chance.” NTU had evaluated 1,400 students under the scheme last year and about 600 were given a place. All three universities said that even as they exercise flexibility, it is still important for students to show that they possess the "adequate academic competence" to go through the rigour and demands of a university education.  - CNA/ms",13.148333691613786

The interview ended surprisingly faster than expected - far less than 10 minutes. However, there were no questions related to assess my competency for ACBS, and I guess that these questions are completely the same as single degree interview. Also, I doubt they even know what I actually applied for. So for those who are applying ACBS as well, do rest assure.  Comparing NTU and SMU, I find that NTU is more rigid in the way they conduct their interviews. They seem to have a list of standardized questions to be asked. Whereas for SMU, after I spoken about my attachment in one of the Big 4, the whole conversation was all about the work I did, and how I was able to cope with stress in the environment. Very friendly professors. As such, it is much easier to control your conversation topic for SMU. Again, in my opinion, NTU is more interested in how you can contribute to NTU. Whilst for SMU, the professors really want to know you as an individual. Also, the interviewers in NTU seem to be expressionless; it feels that I was talking to robots, but at the very least they did hold eye contact with me. Both are equally efficient in conducting their interviews nevertheless. Generally agree with Aomatsu.  Just to add on, I went for the ACBS interview back in 2014, because, you know, NS, and the main interviewer was Prof Valerie. We had a rather entertaining conversation and it was more of a chit-chat session than an interview. NTU knows what courses you applied for. She had my application form in hard copy on the table (in full view) and asked me why I applied for REP as my 2nd choice, and only put Accountancy (single degree) as the 3rd choice. Other than that, the main focus was definitely on how I would contribute NTU if they offered me a place/scholarship. Of course I talked about joining some clubs in NBS, my career goals and the various competitions/events at NTU which interest me. They didn't ask me those "essay" kind of questions though, but we chatted for around 20 minutes. It was a very light-hearted and enjoyable session and it felt really short in fact. After the interview, the prof invited me to apply for the USP. I also went for the SMU interview (also in 2014) for the double degree programme in Accountancy and Business. I remember being interviewed by Prof Seow and Prof Gary Pan. They seemed really concerned about whether I applied to NUS/NTU and asked me which I would pick if I was offered all 3. It somehow gave me the impression that they were being insecure/desperate. However, I liked the fact that they gave more attention to my hobbies and interests and focused less on academic achievements. I guess this is one example of SMU's holistic admissions process. They were also constantly marketing their school throughout the interview by asking me if I knew that their school of accountancy was ranked xxx in the BYU rankings etc, and kept comparing them to the other 2 unis. What I got out of that interview was that the profs at SMU are really passionate about what they do and that they're incredibly driven especially when it comes to building the school's reputation.  At the end of the day, both are local universities. Employers will lump NUS/NTU/SMU together anyway. So in terms of employability, no difference really. Choose the school which suits your personality better.",13.142454713816718

2016,Singapore Management University|smu,Hwa Chong Junior College|hwa chong|hc|hcjc|computer|com|infosys|information systems|analytics,"Which university? Which course of study?Aim for a course that best suits you, rather than enrol in the most lucrative one Tan Eng Chye Prof Tan is deputy president (academic affairs) and provost at the National University of Singapore. PUBLISHED 6 HOURS AGOhttp://www.straitstimes.com/singapor...ourse-of-study The university admissions season is in full swing, and this is an exciting time for students in Singapore. The tertiary education landscape here has expanded significantly, and there are now many varied and interesting pathways for students to choose from, from traditional professional degree courses in medicine or engineering, to music and the liberal arts and science. Many parents I met at the National University of Singapore's (NUS) Open Day last month remarked that they are envious of the plethora of choices their children have, and wish to be young once more. Some of you may have secured multiple offers from different universities in Singapore and overseas, and you will have to make an acceptance decision soon. But how should one decide? Every year, the Ministry of Education publishes the employment rates and median starting salaries of fresh graduates of the different degree programmes offered by local universities. I certainly hope students do not make decisions based solely on data obtained through the Graduate Employment Survey (GES). GES data provides an indication of starting salaries. Starting salaries are but a guide; they neither set the course nor determine one's career trajectory or destiny. In this volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous or "Vuca" world, one cannot predict the future or where the lucrative jobs will be. You would therefore want your university education to equip you with broad-based life skills, and develop you with the flexibility and resilience needed to pick up new knowledge, adapt to new circumstances, and exploit job opportunities across a variety of sectors throughout your lifetime of careers. Another consideration is whether and how the university course adds value to your educational journey. Some students (and parents) may look to university rankings as a measure of the strength of a university department. And there are definitely synergies between research and education. If the university department excels in research, and counts world-leading researchers in the field, it is likely that cutting-edge research will filter through to your learning experience. You will have the opportunity to be taught by highly regarded academics, and there will be plenty of opportunities to conduct research under the who's-who in the field. This is particularly valuable if you have a very strong interest in research or academia. Choosing a university that excels in your area of interest may also open up more specialised opportunities, such as advanced facilities, academic opportunities such as overseas study or research trips, as well as internships and employment opportunities with prestigious organisations in the industry. Beyond academic reputation, your choice of university will also affect your life intellectually, socially and professionally. You should evaluate the entire student experience, and whether it will suit you. Find out if the social setting on campus is what you would want to be part of. NUS has, for example, the Yale-NUS College and the University Town Residential College programmes, which offer an integrated living and learning experience, amid a collegial and intellectually vibrant setting. Another distinctive programme is the NUS Overseas Colleges programme, where students get to live, work and study in an entrepreneurial hub such as Silicon Valley, New York City or Stockholm, taking entrepreneurship classes at a partner university while working in promising entrepreneurial start-ups. All universities have carefully developed their own suite of programmes and it is worth your time and effort to find out what is on offer. Talk to the professors, and to current students. Universities hold Open Days and various outreach sessions where you can visit the campus and get first-hand information. The best-ranked university or the programme that offers you two degrees in the shortest duration may sound attractive, but they may not necessarily be what you are looking for.  Some of you may want an intensely academic experience, and to pick up as many degrees in the shortest possible time. Yet others may prefer to develop a broader range of capabilities, to try out new things, or to pursue more varied experiences. You should aim to identify a university and a course that best suits you, and not simply enrol in the most competitive or lucrative course. After all, you will be spending your next three to four years in this programme. For those of you whose grades may not meet the degree programme's published entry requirements, do not give up. All local universities have discretionary admissions schemes. Last year, NUS interviewed a record 1,600 students under the scheme, and admitted 670 students. This scheme allows universities to assess applicants more holistically, and to consider their passions and attributes such as leadership, resilience or entrepreneurial skills or talent in non-academic areas. The good news is that from the next academic year onwards, NUS, Nanyang Technological University and Singapore Management University can take in more students under the Discretionary Admissions Scheme, from 10 per cent of the annual intake currently, to up to 15 per cent. This will enable more students to enter universities on the basis of their strengths and talents, beyond academic performance. There is no perfect university. What is key is to make a considered decision with the resources and information that are available to you. Your degree should help start you on the journey to where you want to go. The knowledge, experiences and opportunities in your university life should also prepare you for life beyond your degree. As a student in Singapore, you will have up to the beginning of June to decide on your offers from most of the local universities. Whatever you eventually decide on, make the most of your university experience because, for many, it will be the best time of your life.",14.829153173214898

I was hoping to get some advice from you guys here. Firstly, Congrats to all those who have successful applications. To those who are still waiting, or got rejected, don't feel despair, i'm pretty sure you'll find your way out. Like a professional juggler once told me, his biggest lesson in juggling isn't any particular technically-advanced sleights, but this: "When the ball drops, pick it up." Simple, but means a lot. Now, my story: I am from the '94 batch. Took my A levels in 2012, flunk it really badly, because I was heavily distracted by relationship issues (broke up with my ex, which caused a whole landslide trail of problems. But that's another whole long story, and besides the point). I barely studied during A levels then, and entered the exam hall hoping to fail. But miraculously, i scraped through it, and wasn't allowed to retain in JC. The resultant problem: Straight C result, with one S grade. Devastatingly embarrassing, and was a crushing defeat. You see, I come from an IP school, and that technically means that, should I flunk my A levels, all i'm equivalent of is a Primary 6 standard. So here I am, half of my life, effectively erased on papers. I gone on to enlist in NS, and kept my report card hidden away in the "shameful" corner of my room, collecting dust. After NS, i decided to take a break, took a gap year, all these while, casting aside any thoughts on studies and the education system. I went on to completing 1 internship, and 2 other jobs, as well as backpacking around Europe, South East Asia and Australia. It was fulfilling, and definitely a worthwhile experience. But now, 3 years after receiving my poor A levels result, I finally decided to get back on to the system, and apply for university. Expectedly, even with DA (I was a former national athlete, and I had my employers write in recommendation letters), I was sorrowfully rejected. This time, it hit me hard, after all these years of "escaping", I was finally facing the music, and there and then i knew I had to do sth with my life to move on.TL;DR: I still want to enter university. I know i can do better than that "shitty" result i've got. So here's what I came for, hoping for someone to offer me some advice. Personally, I am contemplating on retaking A levels. My previous subject combination was PMEE. I know my science practical grades could no longer be used, so i have to go to a private institution to do it. I am considering going to MDIS and follow its system. (Question, does anybody have any experience or knowledge or advice on MDIS? Is it a good choice for me?) On top of that, I am intending on going for private tuition to brush up my skills, because i've heard that MDIS tutors aren't the best, or at least they aren't as good as JC MOE teachers. (So, does anybody know of any good 1-to-1 tutors, that could give you undivided attention?) Lastly, is anybody here intending to repeat A levels, I was hoping to form a study group of a couple students, and mug together, and we could encourage one another. This is my one shot, i'm giving my all, and keeping my head in the game. Thank you for reading, hope to get some responses. Really sorry to learn of your predicament. Im in a same situation as u, also from ip. Registration for re taking a levels this year as private candidate has alrdy ended. Have u tried applying to private unis such as sim? Im still waiting for smu and sim to get back to me. If all else fails, maybe we can retake together! If thats the case, i might change my combi to science instead of arts haha",14.372325656409052
2016,Singapore Management University|smu,Hwa Chong Junior College|hwa chong|hc|hcjc|computer|com|infosys|information systems|analytics,"DISCLAIMER: I'd like to say that this post is not meant to flame anyone or put a negative spotlight on anyone. The examples I highlighted below are simply the comments/questions that I spotted which inspired me to write this. I wouldn't want to start a discussion about education in Singapore here, nor would this a debate for JC vs Poly. Just a little background about myself - I was a comms student in poly, did pretty average for my GPA (3.5x), missed the uni application in my first year of army, got rejected by NTU ADM last year, finally got a late acceptance letter from ADM this year. So trust me when I say I can empathise with those who are still waiting for their acceptance letter, and why some people are asking certain questions here.Spoiler!Hi guys, care to give your opinions and views on SMU Business VS NUS Statistics?  Which one will have higher demand by employers? The answer to this is simple, ask yourself where do you want to work? MNC? Local startup? The big 4? Starting your own business? Government sector? The 'value' of a degree is only given to by the people looking at it. Even then, there are those companies in each category that would defy the stereotypical hiring policy. So my advice to the poster who asked this question is to define who are your said 'employers' first. If you have no idea where you want to work or which sector of business you want to be in, it might serve you better to understand more about the course to see which specific programme/school/school culture might suit you better rather which degree appeals more to 'employers'. It's better to make an informed choice yourself.Spoiler!Actually, people do look at where you study. I got a couple of friends in HR. They told me that they would also look at the university, course, GPA/grades, modules taken, then any leadership roles regardless of how many years of relevant work experience a person has. Some say they tend to give more priority to old boys/girls, alum, that sort of thing. I'm not saying you're wrong here buddy, and in fact you're correct in saying this! But like I mentioned previously, it depends on where you're applying for work at, what is the company's hiring policy, what are they looking for etc. Comments like this might mislead some to think that this one degree/choice of school will make or break their future. What your friends experienced are the hiring policies of their particular companies they work at, but it's definitely not the same across various companies.There's no 'one size fits all' answer to certain questions. There is also no 'only one single path' to success. Some students don't realise it yet. This is the point that I'm driving at - Students should not be afraid to seek out multiple answers to a single question. There is always more than one way to solve a single question. Isn't that how it is for Math too? There may be one solution given in the answer book but it doesn't mean that that's the only one.If you do not get your university placing in the public schools this year, there are many other options! For poly students, you can take a gap year and work first, try again next year or the year after, like what I was planning to do myself should I not get my placing this year. Work experience ain't a bad idea too. For JC students, you can always take the A's again (like what some here are planning to do), to get a better grade for your dream course on the next application. I had a friend who couldn't get pharmaceutical, retook his A's while serving NS, scored a much better grade and went on to pharmaceutical on a scholarship in the end. If you really want to study this year, then private schools might be a viable idea as well. Yes things might not have gone according to plan for you. You might have been taught your whole life that you must get into NTU/NUS/SMU, or that might have been pressure on yourself. But fact is, if you're not getting in (even after appeal), then it's on you to take your next step forward. You have to keep moving forward in life despite the obstacles you face. If you're really rejected in the end, allow yourself to be sad for a little while, then pick yourself up, make plans, take the next step forward and move on. You might have to take a little detour, but it doesn't mean you can't get there. It's just how badly you want it. I hope this lengthy post written at 3am in the morning would encourage some of you even a little, because I know what it's like to constantly fail at every turn and have life keep pushing you down. If it did, then I'm glad. ",13.914498946647969

SMU received 1,108 applications for the 45 places in the course, which means about 25 students are vying for every place. The demand for the new course has also led to a rise in total number of applications - 14,000 in all this year, a 6 per cent rise over last year. Earlier this year, when SMU announced the new course, its officials likened it to Oxford University's prestigious politics, philosophy and economics course. It is aimed at giving students a broad understanding of how the world works and will prepare them for a range of careers. Students who had applied for the course said it is an unusual combination since it includes the study of law with economics and politics - and prestigious to boot as it is being offered to only a select group of high-calibre students. Many were also drawn by the fact that the course would prepare them for a wide range of jobs, including in journalism, foreign affairs, public service, consulting and research. SMU provost Lily Kong said she was delighted with the response. She added: "From all our engagement sessions, it is clear that students, parents and employers recognise the value that the PLE combination of disciplines can bring in preparing graduates who can handle multifaceted careers... "Through a deeper understanding of how politics, law and economics intersect to shape the world in which we live, we hope to groom a new generation of leaders and thinkers for Singapore." The 45 students selected for the course will take all three subjects in the first year, before specialising in one of four areas - global studies, distribution and justice, public policy and governance, or choice and behaviour - from year two. Students will also have to go on a 10-week internship during which they will work on a project to find solutions to a real-world problem. SMU said several firms have indicated their interest in offering internships to those on the course. They include the Economic Development Board as well as consultancies like Bain and Company. SMU officials said close to 5,000 of the 14,000 applicants have been shortlisted so far. They will be further assessed via interviews. Professor Kong said that, besides academic results, SMU uses other criteria for admission. "Exam grades are a valid measure, but they cannot be the sole measure of a student's ability." The university is the first in Singapore to require all [shortlisted] candidates to attend an interview. It started the practice 16 years ago, when 2,000 students applied to become part of its pioneer batch. Interviews are still required now, although the number of candidates shortlisted for the six undergraduate degree courses has trebled. They are conducted individually or in groups, with professors on the lookout for intellectual curiosity and leadership qualities. SMU said a select group of students - about 1,000 - with strong academic and other abilities were invited to visit the university on "SMU Discovery Day" this year. Prof Kong said: "Our engagement is directed at confirming that they are indeed an excellent match for the education that SMU offers, and for them to confirm that SMU is the university of choice for them." A-level holder Benedict Lim, 20, who applied for the PLE course, said: "I have an interest in both (law and economics) and had a hard time picking one, so when I heard about SMU's new course, I jumped at the chance." He is keen on a broad-based education as he believes it will train him to be versatile and adaptable and enable him to switch careers. "You know what they say about students having to take on jobs that don't exist today. "I really do believe that. That's why it is best to have a broad-based education, so that you have a broad understanding of issues and how the world works." Probably an inflated nunber What they shld publish rather is the number of ppl putting that as their first choice at smu",13.257581219483185
2016,Singapore Management University|smu,Hwa Chong Junior College|hwa chong|hc|hcjc|computer|com|infosys|information systems|analytics,"SINGAPORE: Three of Singapore's autonomous universities are refining the way they admit students under the Discretionary Admissions Scheme, which looks beyond a person's academic achievements. It comes as the universities prepare to take in more students under the scheme, when the current cap of 10 per cent allowed for discretionary admissions goes up to 15 per cent next year. ADVERTISING inRead invented by Teads National University of Singapore (NUS) is offering 7,000 places for the coming academic year, but it has received four times the number of applicants. While it has started handing out offers to those who made the cut based on their grades, about 1,800 students who did not are undergoing interviews to be considered for discretionary admissions this year. NUS has been evaluating and admitting more students under the scheme over the years. Last year, it evaluated 1,600 students, 400 more than 2014. 670 of them got in, 70 more than 2014. With more students expected to be considered for discretionary admissions, the process at NUS may be refined. Said Professor Tan Eng Chye, deputy president of academic affairs at NUS: “We are evolving; for instance, we have gotten alumni to help us with the interviews. I find that very useful because the alumni have a lot of experience in sizing up people and candidates, and they ask very useful questions. “We also provide more data on what to look out for and if the numbers get to be big, we may decide that maybe we can have sort of a test first - not an academic test per se, but perhaps a test to look at other non-academic aspects of that person. It could be an aptitude test.” Prof Tan added: “Exercising flexibility is one aspect; you also have to be fairly sharp on what to look for - it is not simply: 'OK, meet the numbers.' Our interest is to look for attributes of the applicants that would make the student community more interesting, more diversified, and enhance the interaction within the student community. “Those who can adequately and can eloquently convey their passions and interests - that would be advantageous. But we also have to look out for students who may not be able to communicate as well, but yet they have the potential for us to groom them to be able graduates.” At the Singapore Management University (SMU), discretionary admissions currently form about 5 to 8 per cent of the annual intake. With the higher cap of 15 per cent for such admissions next year, the university will have "more leeway" when assessing students. Professor Pang Yang Hoong, vice provost for undergraduate matters and student development at SMU, said: “For SMU, looking at students with other qualifications is not something terribly new because we always been holistic in the way we assess students and their suitability for admission. We will be more flexible. “(We look for) passion, the aptitude for the course for which we are admitting them into. It would also be ideal if students have demonstrated that they are successful to be in time management, that they also possess resilience and the ability to overcome difficult situations. This will help us to assess if that person has got the resilience and the determination to do well in the programme.” SMU is expecting more polytechnic graduates to apply through the discretionary route with the cap being raised to 15 per cent of the annual intake. Nanyang Technological University (NTU) will also "broaden the criteria", to give more people a shot at securing a place. It will favourably consider those who possess "enthusiasm and relevant work experience". Professor Kam Chan Hin, senior associate provost for undergraduate education at NTU, commented: “Normally, they will look at other achievements that they have - whether in sports, in arts … or even if they are very passionate about community service, leadership. So these are the things that we usually look for. “We are going to encourage all the schools to broaden the criteria, to allow more people who have a very strong passion, to be given the opportunity to be interviewed. We should be more adventurous, open it a bit more and ask more questions, outside of the usual parameters, and if you find somebody who is really very interesting and very passionate … give them a chance.” NTU had evaluated 1,400 students under the scheme last year and about 600 were given a place. All three universities said that even as they exercise flexibility, it is still important for students to show that they possess the "adequate academic competence" to go through the rigour and demands of a university education.  - CNA/ms",13.148333691613786

The interview ended surprisingly faster than expected - far less than 10 minutes. However, there were no questions related to assess my competency for ACBS, and I guess that these questions are completely the same as single degree interview. Also, I doubt they even know what I actually applied for. So for those who are applying ACBS as well, do rest assure.  Comparing NTU and SMU, I find that NTU is more rigid in the way they conduct their interviews. They seem to have a list of standardized questions to be asked. Whereas for SMU, after I spoken about my attachment in one of the Big 4, the whole conversation was all about the work I did, and how I was able to cope with stress in the environment. Very friendly professors. As such, it is much easier to control your conversation topic for SMU. Again, in my opinion, NTU is more interested in how you can contribute to NTU. Whilst for SMU, the professors really want to know you as an individual. Also, the interviewers in NTU seem to be expressionless; it feels that I was talking to robots, but at the very least they did hold eye contact with me. Both are equally efficient in conducting their interviews nevertheless. Generally agree with Aomatsu.  Just to add on, I went for the ACBS interview back in 2014, because, you know, NS, and the main interviewer was Prof Valerie. We had a rather entertaining conversation and it was more of a chit-chat session than an interview. NTU knows what courses you applied for. She had my application form in hard copy on the table (in full view) and asked me why I applied for REP as my 2nd choice, and only put Accountancy (single degree) as the 3rd choice. Other than that, the main focus was definitely on how I would contribute NTU if they offered me a place/scholarship. Of course I talked about joining some clubs in NBS, my career goals and the various competitions/events at NTU which interest me. They didn't ask me those "essay" kind of questions though, but we chatted for around 20 minutes. It was a very light-hearted and enjoyable session and it felt really short in fact. After the interview, the prof invited me to apply for the USP. I also went for the SMU interview (also in 2014) for the double degree programme in Accountancy and Business. I remember being interviewed by Prof Seow and Prof Gary Pan. They seemed really concerned about whether I applied to NUS/NTU and asked me which I would pick if I was offered all 3. It somehow gave me the impression that they were being insecure/desperate. However, I liked the fact that they gave more attention to my hobbies and interests and focused less on academic achievements. I guess this is one example of SMU's holistic admissions process. They were also constantly marketing their school throughout the interview by asking me if I knew that their school of accountancy was ranked xxx in the BYU rankings etc, and kept comparing them to the other 2 unis. What I got out of that interview was that the profs at SMU are really passionate about what they do and that they're incredibly driven especially when it comes to building the school's reputation.  At the end of the day, both are local universities. Employers will lump NUS/NTU/SMU together anyway. So in terms of employability, no difference really. Choose the school which suits your personality better.",13.142454713816718
2016,Singapore Management University|smu,Hwa Chong Junior College|hwa chong|hc|hcjc|computer|com|infosys|information systems|analytics,"New SMU course: 1,108 vying for 45 placesCombination of politics, law and economics proves a winner; total number of applications up 6% to 14,000 Sandra Davie, Senior Education Correspondenthttp://www.straitstimes.com/singapor...-for-45-places A new degree course at Singapore Management University (SMU) which offers a combination of politics, law and economics (PLE) is a hit with young Singaporeans hoping to land a university place this year. SMU received 1,108 applications for the 45 places in the course, which means about 25 students are vying for every place. The demand for the new course has also led to a rise in total number of applications - 14,000 in all this year, a 6 per cent rise over last year. Earlier this year, when SMU announced the new course, its officials likened it to Oxford University's prestigious politics, philosophy and economics course. It is aimed at giving students a broad understanding of how the world works and will prepare them for a range of careers. Students who had applied for the course said it is an unusual combination since it includes the study of law with economics and politics - and prestigious to boot as it is being offered to only a select group of high-calibre students. Many were also drawn by the fact that the course would prepare them for a wide range of jobs, including in journalism, foreign affairs, public service, consulting and research. SMU provost Lily Kong said she was delighted with the response. She added: "From all our engagement sessions, it is clear that students, parents and employers recognise the value that the PLE combination of disciplines can bring in preparing graduates who can handle multifaceted careers... "Through a deeper understanding of how politics, law and economics intersect to shape the world in which we live, we hope to groom a new generation of leaders and thinkers for Singapore." The 45 students selected for the course will take all three subjects in the first year, before specialising in one of four areas - global studies, distribution and justice, public policy and governance, or choice and behaviour - from year two. Students will also have to go on a 10-week internship during which they will work on a project to find solutions to a real-world problem. SMU said several firms have indicated their interest in offering internships to those on the course. They include the Economic Development Board as well as consultancies like Bain and Company. SMU officials said close to 5,000 of the 14,000 applicants have been shortlisted so far. They will be further assessed via interviews. Professor Kong said that, besides academic results, SMU uses other criteria for admission. "Exam grades are a valid measure, but they cannot be the sole measure of a student's ability." The university is the first in Singapore to require all [shortlisted] candidates to attend an interview. It started the practice 16 years ago, when 2,000 students applied to become part of its pioneer batch. Interviews are still required now, although the number of candidates shortlisted for the six undergraduate degree courses has trebled. They are conducted individually or in groups, with professors on the lookout for intellectual curiosity and leadership qualities. SMU said a select group of students - about 1,000 - with strong academic and other abilities were invited to visit the university on "SMU Discovery Day" this year. Prof Kong said: "Our engagement is directed at confirming that they are indeed an excellent match for the education that SMU offers, and for them to confirm that SMU is the university of choice for them." A-level holder Benedict Lim, 20, who applied for the PLE course, said: "I have an interest in both (law and economics) and had a hard time picking one, so when I heard about SMU's new course, I jumped at the chance." He is keen on a broad-based education as he believes it will train him to be versatile and adaptable and enable him to switch careers. "You know what they say about students having to take on jobs that don't exist today. "I really do believe that. That's why it is best to have a broad-based education, so that you have a broad understanding of issues and how the world works."",12.996025800973168

2016,Singapore Management University|smu,Innova Junior College|innova jc|ijc|computer|com|infosys|information systems|analytics,"Which university? Which course of study?Aim for a course that best suits you, rather than enrol in the most lucrative one Tan Eng Chye Prof Tan is deputy president (academic affairs) and provost at the National University of Singapore. PUBLISHED 6 HOURS AGOhttp://www.straitstimes.com/singapor...ourse-of-study The university admissions season is in full swing, and this is an exciting time for students in Singapore. The tertiary education landscape here has expanded significantly, and there are now many varied and interesting pathways for students to choose from, from traditional professional degree courses in medicine or engineering, to music and the liberal arts and science. Many parents I met at the National University of Singapore's (NUS) Open Day last month remarked that they are envious of the plethora of choices their children have, and wish to be young once more. Some of you may have secured multiple offers from different universities in Singapore and overseas, and you will have to make an acceptance decision soon. But how should one decide? Every year, the Ministry of Education publishes the employment rates and median starting salaries of fresh graduates of the different degree programmes offered by local universities. I certainly hope students do not make decisions based solely on data obtained through the Graduate Employment Survey (GES). GES data provides an indication of starting salaries. Starting salaries are but a guide; they neither set the course nor determine one's career trajectory or destiny. In this volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous or "Vuca" world, one cannot predict the future or where the lucrative jobs will be. You would therefore want your university education to equip you with broad-based life skills, and develop you with the flexibility and resilience needed to pick up new knowledge, adapt to new circumstances, and exploit job opportunities across a variety of sectors throughout your lifetime of careers. Another consideration is whether and how the university course adds value to your educational journey. Some students (and parents) may look to university rankings as a measure of the strength of a university department. And there are definitely synergies between research and education. If the university department excels in research, and counts world-leading researchers in the field, it is likely that cutting-edge research will filter through to your learning experience. You will have the opportunity to be taught by highly regarded academics, and there will be plenty of opportunities to conduct research under the who's-who in the field. This is particularly valuable if you have a very strong interest in research or academia. Choosing a university that excels in your area of interest may also open up more specialised opportunities, such as advanced facilities, academic opportunities such as overseas study or research trips, as well as internships and employment opportunities with prestigious organisations in the industry. Beyond academic reputation, your choice of university will also affect your life intellectually, socially and professionally. You should evaluate the entire student experience, and whether it will suit you. Find out if the social setting on campus is what you would want to be part of. NUS has, for example, the Yale-NUS College and the University Town Residential College programmes, which offer an integrated living and learning experience, amid a collegial and intellectually vibrant setting. Another distinctive programme is the NUS Overseas Colleges programme, where students get to live, work and study in an entrepreneurial hub such as Silicon Valley, New York City or Stockholm, taking entrepreneurship classes at a partner university while working in promising entrepreneurial start-ups. All universities have carefully developed their own suite of programmes and it is worth your time and effort to find out what is on offer. Talk to the professors, and to current students. Universities hold Open Days and various outreach sessions where you can visit the campus and get first-hand information. The best-ranked university or the programme that offers you two degrees in the shortest duration may sound attractive, but they may not necessarily be what you are looking for.  Some of you may want an intensely academic experience, and to pick up as many degrees in the shortest possible time. Yet others may prefer to develop a broader range of capabilities, to try out new things, or to pursue more varied experiences. You should aim to identify a university and a course that best suits you, and not simply enrol in the most competitive or lucrative course. After all, you will be spending your next three to four years in this programme. For those of you whose grades may not meet the degree programme's published entry requirements, do not give up. All local universities have discretionary admissions schemes. Last year, NUS interviewed a record 1,600 students under the scheme, and admitted 670 students. This scheme allows universities to assess applicants more holistically, and to consider their passions and attributes such as leadership, resilience or entrepreneurial skills or talent in non-academic areas. The good news is that from the next academic year onwards, NUS, Nanyang Technological University and Singapore Management University can take in more students under the Discretionary Admissions Scheme, from 10 per cent of the annual intake currently, to up to 15 per cent. This will enable more students to enter universities on the basis of their strengths and talents, beyond academic performance. There is no perfect university. What is key is to make a considered decision with the resources and information that are available to you. Your degree should help start you on the journey to where you want to go. The knowledge, experiences and opportunities in your university life should also prepare you for life beyond your degree. As a student in Singapore, you will have up to the beginning of June to decide on your offers from most of the local universities. Whatever you eventually decide on, make the most of your university experience because, for many, it will be the best time of your life.",14.829153173214898

I was hoping to get some advice from you guys here. Firstly, Congrats to all those who have successful applications. To those who are still waiting, or got rejected, don't feel despair, i'm pretty sure you'll find your way out. Like a professional juggler once told me, his biggest lesson in juggling isn't any particular technically-advanced sleights, but this: "When the ball drops, pick it up." Simple, but means a lot. Now, my story: I am from the '94 batch. Took my A levels in 2012, flunk it really badly, because I was heavily distracted by relationship issues (broke up with my ex, which caused a whole landslide trail of problems. But that's another whole long story, and besides the point). I barely studied during A levels then, and entered the exam hall hoping to fail. But miraculously, i scraped through it, and wasn't allowed to retain in JC. The resultant problem: Straight C result, with one S grade. Devastatingly embarrassing, and was a crushing defeat. You see, I come from an IP school, and that technically means that, should I flunk my A levels, all i'm equivalent of is a Primary 6 standard. So here I am, half of my life, effectively erased on papers. I gone on to enlist in NS, and kept my report card hidden away in the "shameful" corner of my room, collecting dust. After NS, i decided to take a break, took a gap year, all these while, casting aside any thoughts on studies and the education system. I went on to completing 1 internship, and 2 other jobs, as well as backpacking around Europe, South East Asia and Australia. It was fulfilling, and definitely a worthwhile experience. But now, 3 years after receiving my poor A levels result, I finally decided to get back on to the system, and apply for university. Expectedly, even with DA (I was a former national athlete, and I had my employers write in recommendation letters), I was sorrowfully rejected. This time, it hit me hard, after all these years of "escaping", I was finally facing the music, and there and then i knew I had to do sth with my life to move on.TL;DR: I still want to enter university. I know i can do better than that "shitty" result i've got. So here's what I came for, hoping for someone to offer me some advice. Personally, I am contemplating on retaking A levels. My previous subject combination was PMEE. I know my science practical grades could no longer be used, so i have to go to a private institution to do it. I am considering going to MDIS and follow its system. (Question, does anybody have any experience or knowledge or advice on MDIS? Is it a good choice for me?) On top of that, I am intending on going for private tuition to brush up my skills, because i've heard that MDIS tutors aren't the best, or at least they aren't as good as JC MOE teachers. (So, does anybody know of any good 1-to-1 tutors, that could give you undivided attention?) Lastly, is anybody here intending to repeat A levels, I was hoping to form a study group of a couple students, and mug together, and we could encourage one another. This is my one shot, i'm giving my all, and keeping my head in the game. Thank you for reading, hope to get some responses. Really sorry to learn of your predicament. Im in a same situation as u, also from ip. Registration for re taking a levels this year as private candidate has alrdy ended. Have u tried applying to private unis such as sim? Im still waiting for smu and sim to get back to me. If all else fails, maybe we can retake together! If thats the case, i might change my combi to science instead of arts haha",14.372325656409052
2016,Singapore Management University|smu,Innova Junior College|innova jc|ijc|computer|com|infosys|information systems|analytics,"DISCLAIMER: I'd like to say that this post is not meant to flame anyone or put a negative spotlight on anyone. The examples I highlighted below are simply the comments/questions that I spotted which inspired me to write this. I wouldn't want to start a discussion about education in Singapore here, nor would this a debate for JC vs Poly. Just a little background about myself - I was a comms student in poly, did pretty average for my GPA (3.5x), missed the uni application in my first year of army, got rejected by NTU ADM last year, finally got a late acceptance letter from ADM this year. So trust me when I say I can empathise with those who are still waiting for their acceptance letter, and why some people are asking certain questions here.Spoiler!Hi guys, care to give your opinions and views on SMU Business VS NUS Statistics?  Which one will have higher demand by employers? The answer to this is simple, ask yourself where do you want to work? MNC? Local startup? The big 4? Starting your own business? Government sector? The 'value' of a degree is only given to by the people looking at it. Even then, there are those companies in each category that would defy the stereotypical hiring policy. So my advice to the poster who asked this question is to define who are your said 'employers' first. If you have no idea where you want to work or which sector of business you want to be in, it might serve you better to understand more about the course to see which specific programme/school/school culture might suit you better rather which degree appeals more to 'employers'. It's better to make an informed choice yourself.Spoiler!Actually, people do look at where you study. I got a couple of friends in HR. They told me that they would also look at the university, course, GPA/grades, modules taken, then any leadership roles regardless of how many years of relevant work experience a person has. Some say they tend to give more priority to old boys/girls, alum, that sort of thing. I'm not saying you're wrong here buddy, and in fact you're correct in saying this! But like I mentioned previously, it depends on where you're applying for work at, what is the company's hiring policy, what are they looking for etc. Comments like this might mislead some to think that this one degree/choice of school will make or break their future. What your friends experienced are the hiring policies of their particular companies they work at, but it's definitely not the same across various companies.There's no 'one size fits all' answer to certain questions. There is also no 'only one single path' to success. Some students don't realise it yet. This is the point that I'm driving at - Students should not be afraid to seek out multiple answers to a single question. There is always more than one way to solve a single question. Isn't that how it is for Math too? There may be one solution given in the answer book but it doesn't mean that that's the only one.If you do not get your university placing in the public schools this year, there are many other options! For poly students, you can take a gap year and work first, try again next year or the year after, like what I was planning to do myself should I not get my placing this year. Work experience ain't a bad idea too. For JC students, you can always take the A's again (like what some here are planning to do), to get a better grade for your dream course on the next application. I had a friend who couldn't get pharmaceutical, retook his A's while serving NS, scored a much better grade and went on to pharmaceutical on a scholarship in the end. If you really want to study this year, then private schools might be a viable idea as well. Yes things might not have gone according to plan for you. You might have been taught your whole life that you must get into NTU/NUS/SMU, or that might have been pressure on yourself. But fact is, if you're not getting in (even after appeal), then it's on you to take your next step forward. You have to keep moving forward in life despite the obstacles you face. If you're really rejected in the end, allow yourself to be sad for a little while, then pick yourself up, make plans, take the next step forward and move on. You might have to take a little detour, but it doesn't mean you can't get there. It's just how badly you want it. I hope this lengthy post written at 3am in the morning would encourage some of you even a little, because I know what it's like to constantly fail at every turn and have life keep pushing you down. If it did, then I'm glad. ",13.914498946647969

2016,Singapore Management University|smu,Innova Junior College|innova jc|ijc|computer|com|infosys|information systems|analytics,"SINGAPORE: Three of Singapore's autonomous universities are refining the way they admit students under the Discretionary Admissions Scheme, which looks beyond a person's academic achievements. It comes as the universities prepare to take in more students under the scheme, when the current cap of 10 per cent allowed for discretionary admissions goes up to 15 per cent next year. ADVERTISING inRead invented by Teads National University of Singapore (NUS) is offering 7,000 places for the coming academic year, but it has received four times the number of applicants. While it has started handing out offers to those who made the cut based on their grades, about 1,800 students who did not are undergoing interviews to be considered for discretionary admissions this year. NUS has been evaluating and admitting more students under the scheme over the years. Last year, it evaluated 1,600 students, 400 more than 2014. 670 of them got in, 70 more than 2014. With more students expected to be considered for discretionary admissions, the process at NUS may be refined. Said Professor Tan Eng Chye, deputy president of academic affairs at NUS: “We are evolving; for instance, we have gotten alumni to help us with the interviews. I find that very useful because the alumni have a lot of experience in sizing up people and candidates, and they ask very useful questions. “We also provide more data on what to look out for and if the numbers get to be big, we may decide that maybe we can have sort of a test first - not an academic test per se, but perhaps a test to look at other non-academic aspects of that person. It could be an aptitude test.” Prof Tan added: “Exercising flexibility is one aspect; you also have to be fairly sharp on what to look for - it is not simply: 'OK, meet the numbers.' Our interest is to look for attributes of the applicants that would make the student community more interesting, more diversified, and enhance the interaction within the student community. “Those who can adequately and can eloquently convey their passions and interests - that would be advantageous. But we also have to look out for students who may not be able to communicate as well, but yet they have the potential for us to groom them to be able graduates.” At the Singapore Management University (SMU), discretionary admissions currently form about 5 to 8 per cent of the annual intake. With the higher cap of 15 per cent for such admissions next year, the university will have "more leeway" when assessing students. Professor Pang Yang Hoong, vice provost for undergraduate matters and student development at SMU, said: “For SMU, looking at students with other qualifications is not something terribly new because we always been holistic in the way we assess students and their suitability for admission. We will be more flexible. “(We look for) passion, the aptitude for the course for which we are admitting them into. It would also be ideal if students have demonstrated that they are successful to be in time management, that they also possess resilience and the ability to overcome difficult situations. This will help us to assess if that person has got the resilience and the determination to do well in the programme.” SMU is expecting more polytechnic graduates to apply through the discretionary route with the cap being raised to 15 per cent of the annual intake. Nanyang Technological University (NTU) will also "broaden the criteria", to give more people a shot at securing a place. It will favourably consider those who possess "enthusiasm and relevant work experience". Professor Kam Chan Hin, senior associate provost for undergraduate education at NTU, commented: “Normally, they will look at other achievements that they have - whether in sports, in arts … or even if they are very passionate about community service, leadership. So these are the things that we usually look for. “We are going to encourage all the schools to broaden the criteria, to allow more people who have a very strong passion, to be given the opportunity to be interviewed. We should be more adventurous, open it a bit more and ask more questions, outside of the usual parameters, and if you find somebody who is really very interesting and very passionate … give them a chance.” NTU had evaluated 1,400 students under the scheme last year and about 600 were given a place. All three universities said that even as they exercise flexibility, it is still important for students to show that they possess the "adequate academic competence" to go through the rigour and demands of a university education.  - CNA/ms",13.148333691613786

Why didn't you apply for Humanities & Social Studies instead? [Probing CCAs & Interests -2] 5. Why do you still want to choose NTU instead of NUS? [Universities Choice -3] Below are just my opinions. The interview ended surprisingly faster than expected - far less than 10 minutes. However, there were no questions related to assess my competency for ACBS, and I guess that these questions are completely the same as single degree interview. Also, I doubt they even know what I actually applied for. So for those who are applying ACBS as well, do rest assure.  Comparing NTU and SMU, I find that NTU is more rigid in the way they conduct their interviews. They seem to have a list of standardized questions to be asked. Whereas for SMU, after I spoken about my attachment in one of the Big 4, the whole conversation was all about the work I did, and how I was able to cope with stress in the environment. Very friendly professors. As such, it is much easier to control your conversation topic for SMU. Again, in my opinion, NTU is more interested in how you can contribute to NTU. Whilst for SMU, the professors really want to know you as an individual. Also, the interviewers in NTU seem to be expressionless; it feels that I was talking to robots, but at the very least they did hold eye contact with me. Both are equally efficient in conducting their interviews nevertheless. Generally agree with Aomatsu.  Just to add on, I went for the ACBS interview back in 2014, because, you know, NS, and the main interviewer was Prof Valerie. We had a rather entertaining conversation and it was more of a chit-chat session than an interview. NTU knows what courses you applied for. She had my application form in hard copy on the table (in full view) and asked me why I applied for REP as my 2nd choice, and only put Accountancy (single degree) as the 3rd choice. Other than that, the main focus was definitely on how I would contribute NTU if they offered me a place/scholarship. Of course I talked about joining some clubs in NBS, my career goals and the various competitions/events at NTU which interest me. They didn't ask me those "essay" kind of questions though, but we chatted for around 20 minutes. It was a very light-hearted and enjoyable session and it felt really short in fact. After the interview, the prof invited me to apply for the USP. I also went for the SMU interview (also in 2014) for the double degree programme in Accountancy and Business. I remember being interviewed by Prof Seow and Prof Gary Pan. They seemed really concerned about whether I applied to NUS/NTU and asked me which I would pick if I was offered all 3. It somehow gave me the impression that they were being insecure/desperate. However, I liked the fact that they gave more attention to my hobbies and interests and focused less on academic achievements. I guess this is one example of SMU's holistic admissions process. They were also constantly marketing their school throughout the interview by asking me if I knew that their school of accountancy was ranked xxx in the BYU rankings etc, and kept comparing them to the other 2 unis. What I got out of that interview was that the profs at SMU are really passionate about what they do and that they're incredibly driven especially when it comes to building the school's reputation.  At the end of the day, both are local universities. Employers will lump NUS/NTU/SMU together anyway. So in terms of employability, no difference really. Choose the school which suits your personality better.",13.142454713816718
2016,Singapore Management University|smu,Innova Junior College|innova jc|ijc|computer|com|infosys|information systems|analytics,"New SMU course: 1,108 vying for 45 placesCombination of politics, law and economics proves a winner; total number of applications up 6% to 14,000 Sandra Davie, Senior Education Correspondenthttp://www.straitstimes.com/singapor...-for-45-places A new degree course at Singapore Management University (SMU) which offers a combination of politics, law and economics (PLE) is a hit with young Singaporeans hoping to land a university place this year. SMU received 1,108 applications for the 45 places in the course, which means about 25 students are vying for every place. The demand for the new course has also led to a rise in total number of applications - 14,000 in all this year, a 6 per cent rise over last year. Earlier this year, when SMU announced the new course, its officials likened it to Oxford University's prestigious politics, philosophy and economics course. It is aimed at giving students a broad understanding of how the world works and will prepare them for a range of careers. Students who had applied for the course said it is an unusual combination since it includes the study of law with economics and politics - and prestigious to boot as it is being offered to only a select group of high-calibre students. Many were also drawn by the fact that the course would prepare them for a wide range of jobs, including in journalism, foreign affairs, public service, consulting and research. SMU provost Lily Kong said she was delighted with the response. She added: "From all our engagement sessions, it is clear that students, parents and employers recognise the value that the PLE combination of disciplines can bring in preparing graduates who can handle multifaceted careers... "Through a deeper understanding of how politics, law and economics intersect to shape the world in which we live, we hope to groom a new generation of leaders and thinkers for Singapore." The 45 students selected for the course will take all three subjects in the first year, before specialising in one of four areas - global studies, distribution and justice, public policy and governance, or choice and behaviour - from year two. Students will also have to go on a 10-week internship during which they will work on a project to find solutions to a real-world problem. SMU said several firms have indicated their interest in offering internships to those on the course. They include the Economic Development Board as well as consultancies like Bain and Company. SMU officials said close to 5,000 of the 14,000 applicants have been shortlisted so far. They will be further assessed via interviews. Professor Kong said that, besides academic results, SMU uses other criteria for admission. "Exam grades are a valid measure, but they cannot be the sole measure of a student's ability." The university is the first in Singapore to require all [shortlisted] candidates to attend an interview. It started the practice 16 years ago, when 2,000 students applied to become part of its pioneer batch. Interviews are still required now, although the number of candidates shortlisted for the six undergraduate degree courses has trebled. They are conducted individually or in groups, with professors on the lookout for intellectual curiosity and leadership qualities. SMU said a select group of students - about 1,000 - with strong academic and other abilities were invited to visit the university on "SMU Discovery Day" this year. Prof Kong said: "Our engagement is directed at confirming that they are indeed an excellent match for the education that SMU offers, and for them to confirm that SMU is the university of choice for them." A-level holder Benedict Lim, 20, who applied for the PLE course, said: "I have an interest in both (law and economics) and had a hard time picking one, so when I heard about SMU's new course, I jumped at the chance." He is keen on a broad-based education as he believes it will train him to be versatile and adaptable and enable him to switch careers. "You know what they say about students having to take on jobs that don't exist today. "I really do believe that. That's why it is best to have a broad-based education, so that you have a broad understanding of issues and how the world works."",12.996025800973168

Which course of study?Aim for a course that best suits you, rather than enrol in the most lucrative one Tan Eng Chye Prof Tan is deputy president (academic affairs) and provost at the National University of Singapore. PUBLISHED 6 HOURS AGOhttp://www.straitstimes.com/singapor...ourse-of-study The university admissions season is in full swing, and this is an exciting time for students in Singapore. The tertiary education landscape here has expanded significantly, and there are now many varied and interesting pathways for students to choose from, from traditional professional degree courses in medicine or engineering, to music and the liberal arts and science. Many parents I met at the National University of Singapore's (NUS) Open Day last month remarked that they are envious of the plethora of choices their children have, and wish to be young once more. Some of you may have secured multiple offers from different universities in Singapore and overseas, and you will have to make an acceptance decision soon. But how should one decide? Every year, the Ministry of Education publishes the employment rates and median starting salaries of fresh graduates of the different degree programmes offered by local universities. I certainly hope students do not make decisions based solely on data obtained through the Graduate Employment Survey (GES). GES data provides an indication of starting salaries. Starting salaries are but a guide; they neither set the course nor determine one's career trajectory or destiny. In this volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous or "Vuca" world, one cannot predict the future or where the lucrative jobs will be. You would therefore want your university education to equip you with broad-based life skills, and develop you with the flexibility and resilience needed to pick up new knowledge, adapt to new circumstances, and exploit job opportunities across a variety of sectors throughout your lifetime of careers. Another consideration is whether and how the university course adds value to your educational journey. Some students (and parents) may look to university rankings as a measure of the strength of a university department. And there are definitely synergies between research and education. If the university department excels in research, and counts world-leading researchers in the field, it is likely that cutting-edge research will filter through to your learning experience. You will have the opportunity to be taught by highly regarded academics, and there will be plenty of opportunities to conduct research under the who's-who in the field. This is particularly valuable if you have a very strong interest in research or academia. Choosing a university that excels in your area of interest may also open up more specialised opportunities, such as advanced facilities, academic opportunities such as overseas study or research trips, as well as internships and employment opportunities with prestigious organisations in the industry. Beyond academic reputation, your choice of university will also affect your life intellectually, socially and professionally. You should evaluate the entire student experience, and whether it will suit you. Find out if the social setting on campus is what you would want to be part of. NUS has, for example, the Yale-NUS College and the University Town Residential College programmes, which offer an integrated living and learning experience, amid a collegial and intellectually vibrant setting. Another distinctive programme is the NUS Overseas Colleges programme, where students get to live, work and study in an entrepreneurial hub such as Silicon Valley, New York City or Stockholm, taking entrepreneurship classes at a partner university while working in promising entrepreneurial start-ups. All universities have carefully developed their own suite of programmes and it is worth your time and effort to find out what is on offer. Talk to the professors, and to current students. Universities hold Open Days and various outreach sessions where you can visit the campus and get first-hand information. The best-ranked university or the programme that offers you two degrees in the shortest duration may sound attractive, but they may not necessarily be what you are looking for.  Some of you may want an intensely academic experience, and to pick up as many degrees in the shortest possible time. Yet others may prefer to develop a broader range of capabilities, to try out new things, or to pursue more varied experiences. You should aim to identify a university and a course that best suits you, and not simply enrol in the most competitive or lucrative course. After all, you will be spending your next three to four years in this programme. For those of you whose grades may not meet the degree programme's published entry requirements, do not give up. All local universities have discretionary admissions schemes. Last year, NUS interviewed a record 1,600 students under the scheme, and admitted 670 students. This scheme allows universities to assess applicants more holistically, and to consider their passions and attributes such as leadership, resilience or entrepreneurial skills or talent in non-academic areas. The good news is that from the next academic year onwards, NUS, Nanyang Technological University and Singapore Management University can take in more students under the Discretionary Admissions Scheme, from 10 per cent of the annual intake currently, to up to 15 per cent. This will enable more students to enter universities on the basis of their strengths and talents, beyond academic performance. There is no perfect university. What is key is to make a considered decision with the resources and information that are available to you. Your degree should help start you on the journey to where you want to go. The knowledge, experiences and opportunities in your university life should also prepare you for life beyond your degree. As a student in Singapore, you will have up to the beginning of June to decide on your offers from most of the local universities. Whatever you eventually decide on, make the most of your university experience because, for many, it will be the best time of your life.",14.829153173214898

I was hoping to get some advice from you guys here. Firstly, Congrats to all those who have successful applications. To those who are still waiting, or got rejected, don't feel despair, i'm pretty sure you'll find your way out. Like a professional juggler once told me, his biggest lesson in juggling isn't any particular technically-advanced sleights, but this: "When the ball drops, pick it up." Simple, but means a lot. Now, my story: I am from the '94 batch. Took my A levels in 2012, flunk it really badly, because I was heavily distracted by relationship issues (broke up with my ex, which caused a whole landslide trail of problems. But that's another whole long story, and besides the point). I barely studied during A levels then, and entered the exam hall hoping to fail. But miraculously, i scraped through it, and wasn't allowed to retain in JC. The resultant problem: Straight C result, with one S grade. Devastatingly embarrassing, and was a crushing defeat. You see, I come from an IP school, and that technically means that, should I flunk my A levels, all i'm equivalent of is a Primary 6 standard. So here I am, half of my life, effectively erased on papers. I gone on to enlist in NS, and kept my report card hidden away in the "shameful" corner of my room, collecting dust. After NS, i decided to take a break, took a gap year, all these while, casting aside any thoughts on studies and the education system. I went on to completing 1 internship, and 2 other jobs, as well as backpacking around Europe, South East Asia and Australia. It was fulfilling, and definitely a worthwhile experience. But now, 3 years after receiving my poor A levels result, I finally decided to get back on to the system, and apply for university. Expectedly, even with DA (I was a former national athlete, and I had my employers write in recommendation letters), I was sorrowfully rejected. This time, it hit me hard, after all these years of "escaping", I was finally facing the music, and there and then i knew I had to do sth with my life to move on.TL;DR: I still want to enter university. I know i can do better than that "shitty" result i've got. So here's what I came for, hoping for someone to offer me some advice. Personally, I am contemplating on retaking A levels. My previous subject combination was PMEE. I know my science practical grades could no longer be used, so i have to go to a private institution to do it. I am considering going to MDIS and follow its system. (Question, does anybody have any experience or knowledge or advice on MDIS? Is it a good choice for me?) On top of that, I am intending on going for private tuition to brush up my skills, because i've heard that MDIS tutors aren't the best, or at least they aren't as good as JC MOE teachers. (So, does anybody know of any good 1-to-1 tutors, that could give you undivided attention?) Lastly, is anybody here intending to repeat A levels, I was hoping to form a study group of a couple students, and mug together, and we could encourage one another. This is my one shot, i'm giving my all, and keeping my head in the game. Thank you for reading, hope to get some responses. Really sorry to learn of your predicament. Im in a same situation as u, also from ip. Registration for re taking a levels this year as private candidate has alrdy ended. Have u tried applying to private unis such as sim? Im still waiting for smu and sim to get back to me. If all else fails, maybe we can retake together! If thats the case, i might change my combi to science instead of arts haha",14.372325656409052

The examples I highlighted below are simply the comments/questions that I spotted which inspired me to write this. I wouldn't want to start a discussion about education in Singapore here, nor would this a debate for JC vs Poly. Just a little background about myself - I was a comms student in poly, did pretty average for my GPA (3.5x), missed the uni application in my first year of army, got rejected by NTU ADM last year, finally got a late acceptance letter from ADM this year. So trust me when I say I can empathise with those who are still waiting for their acceptance letter, and why some people are asking certain questions here.Spoiler!Hi guys, care to give your opinions and views on SMU Business VS NUS Statistics?  Which one will have higher demand by employers? The answer to this is simple, ask yourself where do you want to work? MNC? Local startup? The big 4? Starting your own business? Government sector? The 'value' of a degree is only given to by the people looking at it. Even then, there are those companies in each category that would defy the stereotypical hiring policy. So my advice to the poster who asked this question is to define who are your said 'employers' first. If you have no idea where you want to work or which sector of business you want to be in, it might serve you better to understand more about the course to see which specific programme/school/school culture might suit you better rather which degree appeals more to 'employers'. It's better to make an informed choice yourself.Spoiler!Actually, people do look at where you study. I got a couple of friends in HR. They told me that they would also look at the university, course, GPA/grades, modules taken, then any leadership roles regardless of how many years of relevant work experience a person has. Some say they tend to give more priority to old boys/girls, alum, that sort of thing. I'm not saying you're wrong here buddy, and in fact you're correct in saying this! But like I mentioned previously, it depends on where you're applying for work at, what is the company's hiring policy, what are they looking for etc. Comments like this might mislead some to think that this one degree/choice of school will make or break their future. What your friends experienced are the hiring policies of their particular companies they work at, but it's definitely not the same across various companies.There's no 'one size fits all' answer to certain questions. There is also no 'only one single path' to success. Some students don't realise it yet. This is the point that I'm driving at - Students should not be afraid to seek out multiple answers to a single question. There is always more than one way to solve a single question. Isn't that how it is for Math too? There may be one solution given in the answer book but it doesn't mean that that's the only one.If you do not get your university placing in the public schools this year, there are many other options! For poly students, you can take a gap year and work first, try again next year or the year after, like what I was planning to do myself should I not get my placing this year. Work experience ain't a bad idea too. For JC students, you can always take the A's again (like what some here are planning to do), to get a better grade for your dream course on the next application. I had a friend who couldn't get pharmaceutical, retook his A's while serving NS, scored a much better grade and went on to pharmaceutical on a scholarship in the end. If you really want to study this year, then private schools might be a viable idea as well. Yes things might not have gone according to plan for you. You might have been taught your whole life that you must get into NTU/NUS/SMU, or that might have been pressure on yourself. But fact is, if you're not getting in (even after appeal), then it's on you to take your next step forward. You have to keep moving forward in life despite the obstacles you face. If you're really rejected in the end, allow yourself to be sad for a little while, then pick yourself up, make plans, take the next step forward and move on. You might have to take a little detour, but it doesn't mean you can't get there. It's just how badly you want it. I hope this lengthy post written at 3am in the morning would encourage some of you even a little, because I know what it's like to constantly fail at every turn and have life keep pushing you down. If it did, then I'm glad. ",13.914498946647969

SMU received 1,108 applications for the 45 places in the course, which means about 25 students are vying for every place. The demand for the new course has also led to a rise in total number of applications - 14,000 in all this year, a 6 per cent rise over last year. Earlier this year, when SMU announced the new course, its officials likened it to Oxford University's prestigious politics, philosophy and economics course. It is aimed at giving students a broad understanding of how the world works and will prepare them for a range of careers. Students who had applied for the course said it is an unusual combination since it includes the study of law with economics and politics - and prestigious to boot as it is being offered to only a select group of high-calibre students. Many were also drawn by the fact that the course would prepare them for a wide range of jobs, including in journalism, foreign affairs, public service, consulting and research. SMU provost Lily Kong said she was delighted with the response. She added: "From all our engagement sessions, it is clear that students, parents and employers recognise the value that the PLE combination of disciplines can bring in preparing graduates who can handle multifaceted careers... "Through a deeper understanding of how politics, law and economics intersect to shape the world in which we live, we hope to groom a new generation of leaders and thinkers for Singapore." The 45 students selected for the course will take all three subjects in the first year, before specialising in one of four areas - global studies, distribution and justice, public policy and governance, or choice and behaviour - from year two. Students will also have to go on a 10-week internship during which they will work on a project to find solutions to a real-world problem. SMU said several firms have indicated their interest in offering internships to those on the course. They include the Economic Development Board as well as consultancies like Bain and Company. SMU officials said close to 5,000 of the 14,000 applicants have been shortlisted so far. They will be further assessed via interviews. Professor Kong said that, besides academic results, SMU uses other criteria for admission. "Exam grades are a valid measure, but they cannot be the sole measure of a student's ability." The university is the first in Singapore to require all [shortlisted] candidates to attend an interview. It started the practice 16 years ago, when 2,000 students applied to become part of its pioneer batch. Interviews are still required now, although the number of candidates shortlisted for the six undergraduate degree courses has trebled. They are conducted individually or in groups, with professors on the lookout for intellectual curiosity and leadership qualities. SMU said a select group of students - about 1,000 - with strong academic and other abilities were invited to visit the university on "SMU Discovery Day" this year. Prof Kong said: "Our engagement is directed at confirming that they are indeed an excellent match for the education that SMU offers, and for them to confirm that SMU is the university of choice for them." A-level holder Benedict Lim, 20, who applied for the PLE course, said: "I have an interest in both (law and economics) and had a hard time picking one, so when I heard about SMU's new course, I jumped at the chance." He is keen on a broad-based education as he believes it will train him to be versatile and adaptable and enable him to switch careers. "You know what they say about students having to take on jobs that don't exist today. "I really do believe that. That's why it is best to have a broad-based education, so that you have a broad understanding of issues and how the world works."

2016,Singapore Management University|smu,Jurong Junior College|Jurong Pioneer Junior College|Pioneer Junior College|jurong pioneer jc|jurong jc|pioneer jc|jjc|pjc|jpjc|computer|com|infosys|information systems|analytics,"SINGAPORE: Three of Singapore's autonomous universities are refining the way they admit students under the Discretionary Admissions Scheme, which looks beyond a person's academic achievements. It comes as the universities prepare to take in more students under the scheme, when the current cap of 10 per cent allowed for discretionary admissions goes up to 15 per cent next year. ADVERTISING inRead invented by Teads National University of Singapore (NUS) is offering 7,000 places for the coming academic year, but it has received four times the number of applicants. While it has started handing out offers to those who made the cut based on their grades, about 1,800 students who did not are undergoing interviews to be considered for discretionary admissions this year. NUS has been evaluating and admitting more students under the scheme over the years. Last year, it evaluated 1,600 students, 400 more than 2014. 670 of them got in, 70 more than 2014. With more students expected to be considered for discretionary admissions, the process at NUS may be refined. Said Professor Tan Eng Chye, deputy president of academic affairs at NUS: “We are evolving; for instance, we have gotten alumni to help us with the interviews. I find that very useful because the alumni have a lot of experience in sizing up people and candidates, and they ask very useful questions. “We also provide more data on what to look out for and if the numbers get to be big, we may decide that maybe we can have sort of a test first - not an academic test per se, but perhaps a test to look at other non-academic aspects of that person. It could be an aptitude test.” Prof Tan added: “Exercising flexibility is one aspect; you also have to be fairly sharp on what to look for - it is not simply: 'OK, meet the numbers.' Our interest is to look for attributes of the applicants that would make the student community more interesting, more diversified, and enhance the interaction within the student community. “Those who can adequately and can eloquently convey their passions and interests - that would be advantageous. But we also have to look out for students who may not be able to communicate as well, but yet they have the potential for us to groom them to be able graduates.” At the Singapore Management University (SMU), discretionary admissions currently form about 5 to 8 per cent of the annual intake. With the higher cap of 15 per cent for such admissions next year, the university will have "more leeway" when assessing students. Professor Pang Yang Hoong, vice provost for undergraduate matters and student development at SMU, said: “For SMU, looking at students with other qualifications is not something terribly new because we always been holistic in the way we assess students and their suitability for admission. We will be more flexible. “(We look for) passion, the aptitude for the course for which we are admitting them into. It would also be ideal if students have demonstrated that they are successful to be in time management, that they also possess resilience and the ability to overcome difficult situations. This will help us to assess if that person has got the resilience and the determination to do well in the programme.” SMU is expecting more polytechnic graduates to apply through the discretionary route with the cap being raised to 15 per cent of the annual intake. Nanyang Technological University (NTU) will also "broaden the criteria", to give more people a shot at securing a place. It will favourably consider those who possess "enthusiasm and relevant work experience". Professor Kam Chan Hin, senior associate provost for undergraduate education at NTU, commented: “Normally, they will look at other achievements that they have - whether in sports, in arts … or even if they are very passionate about community service, leadership. So these are the things that we usually look for. “We are going to encourage all the schools to broaden the criteria, to allow more people who have a very strong passion, to be given the opportunity to be interviewed. We should be more adventurous, open it a bit more and ask more questions, outside of the usual parameters, and if you find somebody who is really very interesting and very passionate … give them a chance.” NTU had evaluated 1,400 students under the scheme last year and about 600 were given a place. All three universities said that even as they exercise flexibility, it is still important for students to show that they possess the "adequate academic competence" to go through the rigour and demands of a university education.  - CNA/ms",13.148333691613786

Why didn't you apply for Humanities & Social Studies instead? [Probing CCAs & Interests -2] 5. Why do you still want to choose NTU instead of NUS? [Universities Choice -3] Below are just my opinions. The interview ended surprisingly faster than expected - far less than 10 minutes. However, there were no questions related to assess my competency for ACBS, and I guess that these questions are completely the same as single degree interview. Also, I doubt they even know what I actually applied for. So for those who are applying ACBS as well, do rest assure.  Comparing NTU and SMU, I find that NTU is more rigid in the way they conduct their interviews. They seem to have a list of standardized questions to be asked. Whereas for SMU, after I spoken about my attachment in one of the Big 4, the whole conversation was all about the work I did, and how I was able to cope with stress in the environment. Very friendly professors. As such, it is much easier to control your conversation topic for SMU. Again, in my opinion, NTU is more interested in how you can contribute to NTU. Whilst for SMU, the professors really want to know you as an individual. Also, the interviewers in NTU seem to be expressionless; it feels that I was talking to robots, but at the very least they did hold eye contact with me. Both are equally efficient in conducting their interviews nevertheless. Generally agree with Aomatsu.  Just to add on, I went for the ACBS interview back in 2014, because, you know, NS, and the main interviewer was Prof Valerie. We had a rather entertaining conversation and it was more of a chit-chat session than an interview. NTU knows what courses you applied for. She had my application form in hard copy on the table (in full view) and asked me why I applied for REP as my 2nd choice, and only put Accountancy (single degree) as the 3rd choice. Other than that, the main focus was definitely on how I would contribute NTU if they offered me a place/scholarship. Of course I talked about joining some clubs in NBS, my career goals and the various competitions/events at NTU which interest me. They didn't ask me those "essay" kind of questions though, but we chatted for around 20 minutes. It was a very light-hearted and enjoyable session and it felt really short in fact. After the interview, the prof invited me to apply for the USP. I also went for the SMU interview (also in 2014) for the double degree programme in Accountancy and Business. I remember being interviewed by Prof Seow and Prof Gary Pan. They seemed really concerned about whether I applied to NUS/NTU and asked me which I would pick if I was offered all 3. It somehow gave me the impression that they were being insecure/desperate. However, I liked the fact that they gave more attention to my hobbies and interests and focused less on academic achievements. I guess this is one example of SMU's holistic admissions process. They were also constantly marketing their school throughout the interview by asking me if I knew that their school of accountancy was ranked xxx in the BYU rankings etc, and kept comparing them to the other 2 unis. What I got out of that interview was that the profs at SMU are really passionate about what they do and that they're incredibly driven especially when it comes to building the school's reputation.  At the end of the day, both are local universities. Employers will lump NUS/NTU/SMU together anyway. So in terms of employability, no difference really. Choose the school which suits your personality better.",13.142454713816718

2016,Singapore Management University|smu,Nanyang Junior College|nanyang jc|nyjc|computer|com|infosys|information systems|analytics,"Which university? Which course of study?Aim for a course that best suits you, rather than enrol in the most lucrative one Tan Eng Chye Prof Tan is deputy president (academic affairs) and provost at the National University of Singapore. PUBLISHED 6 HOURS AGOhttp://www.straitstimes.com/singapor...ourse-of-study The university admissions season is in full swing, and this is an exciting time for students in Singapore. The tertiary education landscape here has expanded significantly, and there are now many varied and interesting pathways for students to choose from, from traditional professional degree courses in medicine or engineering, to music and the liberal arts and science. Many parents I met at the National University of Singapore's (NUS) Open Day last month remarked that they are envious of the plethora of choices their children have, and wish to be young once more. Some of you may have secured multiple offers from different universities in Singapore and overseas, and you will have to make an acceptance decision soon. But how should one decide? Every year, the Ministry of Education publishes the employment rates and median starting salaries of fresh graduates of the different degree programmes offered by local universities. I certainly hope students do not make decisions based solely on data obtained through the Graduate Employment Survey (GES). GES data provides an indication of starting salaries. Starting salaries are but a guide; they neither set the course nor determine one's career trajectory or destiny. In this volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous or "Vuca" world, one cannot predict the future or where the lucrative jobs will be. You would therefore want your university education to equip you with broad-based life skills, and develop you with the flexibility and resilience needed to pick up new knowledge, adapt to new circumstances, and exploit job opportunities across a variety of sectors throughout your lifetime of careers. Another consideration is whether and how the university course adds value to your educational journey. Some students (and parents) may look to university rankings as a measure of the strength of a university department. And there are definitely synergies between research and education. If the university department excels in research, and counts world-leading researchers in the field, it is likely that cutting-edge research will filter through to your learning experience. You will have the opportunity to be taught by highly regarded academics, and there will be plenty of opportunities to conduct research under the who's-who in the field. This is particularly valuable if you have a very strong interest in research or academia. Choosing a university that excels in your area of interest may also open up more specialised opportunities, such as advanced facilities, academic opportunities such as overseas study or research trips, as well as internships and employment opportunities with prestigious organisations in the industry. Beyond academic reputation, your choice of university will also affect your life intellectually, socially and professionally. You should evaluate the entire student experience, and whether it will suit you. Find out if the social setting on campus is what you would want to be part of. NUS has, for example, the Yale-NUS College and the University Town Residential College programmes, which offer an integrated living and learning experience, amid a collegial and intellectually vibrant setting. Another distinctive programme is the NUS Overseas Colleges programme, where students get to live, work and study in an entrepreneurial hub such as Silicon Valley, New York City or Stockholm, taking entrepreneurship classes at a partner university while working in promising entrepreneurial start-ups. All universities have carefully developed their own suite of programmes and it is worth your time and effort to find out what is on offer. Talk to the professors, and to current students. Universities hold Open Days and various outreach sessions where you can visit the campus and get first-hand information. The best-ranked university or the programme that offers you two degrees in the shortest duration may sound attractive, but they may not necessarily be what you are looking for.  Some of you may want an intensely academic experience, and to pick up as many degrees in the shortest possible time. Yet others may prefer to develop a broader range of capabilities, to try out new things, or to pursue more varied experiences. You should aim to identify a university and a course that best suits you, and not simply enrol in the most competitive or lucrative course. After all, you will be spending your next three to four years in this programme. For those of you whose grades may not meet the degree programme's published entry requirements, do not give up. All local universities have discretionary admissions schemes. Last year, NUS interviewed a record 1,600 students under the scheme, and admitted 670 students. This scheme allows universities to assess applicants more holistically, and to consider their passions and attributes such as leadership, resilience or entrepreneurial skills or talent in non-academic areas. The good news is that from the next academic year onwards, NUS, Nanyang Technological University and Singapore Management University can take in more students under the Discretionary Admissions Scheme, from 10 per cent of the annual intake currently, to up to 15 per cent. This will enable more students to enter universities on the basis of their strengths and talents, beyond academic performance. There is no perfect university. What is key is to make a considered decision with the resources and information that are available to you. Your degree should help start you on the journey to where you want to go. The knowledge, experiences and opportunities in your university life should also prepare you for life beyond your degree. As a student in Singapore, you will have up to the beginning of June to decide on your offers from most of the local universities. Whatever you eventually decide on, make the most of your university experience because, for many, it will be the best time of your life.",14.829153173214898

I was hoping to get some advice from you guys here. Firstly, Congrats to all those who have successful applications. To those who are still waiting, or got rejected, don't feel despair, i'm pretty sure you'll find your way out. Like a professional juggler once told me, his biggest lesson in juggling isn't any particular technically-advanced sleights, but this: "When the ball drops, pick it up." Simple, but means a lot. Now, my story: I am from the '94 batch. Took my A levels in 2012, flunk it really badly, because I was heavily distracted by relationship issues (broke up with my ex, which caused a whole landslide trail of problems. But that's another whole long story, and besides the point). I barely studied during A levels then, and entered the exam hall hoping to fail. But miraculously, i scraped through it, and wasn't allowed to retain in JC. The resultant problem: Straight C result, with one S grade. Devastatingly embarrassing, and was a crushing defeat. You see, I come from an IP school, and that technically means that, should I flunk my A levels, all i'm equivalent of is a Primary 6 standard. So here I am, half of my life, effectively erased on papers. I gone on to enlist in NS, and kept my report card hidden away in the "shameful" corner of my room, collecting dust. After NS, i decided to take a break, took a gap year, all these while, casting aside any thoughts on studies and the education system. I went on to completing 1 internship, and 2 other jobs, as well as backpacking around Europe, South East Asia and Australia. It was fulfilling, and definitely a worthwhile experience. But now, 3 years after receiving my poor A levels result, I finally decided to get back on to the system, and apply for university. Expectedly, even with DA (I was a former national athlete, and I had my employers write in recommendation letters), I was sorrowfully rejected. This time, it hit me hard, after all these years of "escaping", I was finally facing the music, and there and then i knew I had to do sth with my life to move on.TL;DR: I still want to enter university. I know i can do better than that "shitty" result i've got. So here's what I came for, hoping for someone to offer me some advice. Personally, I am contemplating on retaking A levels. My previous subject combination was PMEE. I know my science practical grades could no longer be used, so i have to go to a private institution to do it. I am considering going to MDIS and follow its system. (Question, does anybody have any experience or knowledge or advice on MDIS? Is it a good choice for me?) On top of that, I am intending on going for private tuition to brush up my skills, because i've heard that MDIS tutors aren't the best, or at least they aren't as good as JC MOE teachers. (So, does anybody know of any good 1-to-1 tutors, that could give you undivided attention?) Lastly, is anybody here intending to repeat A levels, I was hoping to form a study group of a couple students, and mug together, and we could encourage one another. This is my one shot, i'm giving my all, and keeping my head in the game. Thank you for reading, hope to get some responses. Really sorry to learn of your predicament. Im in a same situation as u, also from ip. Registration for re taking a levels this year as private candidate has alrdy ended. Have u tried applying to private unis such as sim? Im still waiting for smu and sim to get back to me. If all else fails, maybe we can retake together! If thats the case, i might change my combi to science instead of arts haha",14.372325656409052
2016,Singapore Management University|smu,Nanyang Junior College|nanyang jc|nyjc|computer|com|infosys|information systems|analytics,"DISCLAIMER: I'd like to say that this post is not meant to flame anyone or put a negative spotlight on anyone. The examples I highlighted below are simply the comments/questions that I spotted which inspired me to write this. I wouldn't want to start a discussion about education in Singapore here, nor would this a debate for JC vs Poly. Just a little background about myself - I was a comms student in poly, did pretty average for my GPA (3.5x), missed the uni application in my first year of army, got rejected by NTU ADM last year, finally got a late acceptance letter from ADM this year. So trust me when I say I can empathise with those who are still waiting for their acceptance letter, and why some people are asking certain questions here.Spoiler!Hi guys, care to give your opinions and views on SMU Business VS NUS Statistics?  Which one will have higher demand by employers? The answer to this is simple, ask yourself where do you want to work? MNC? Local startup? The big 4? Starting your own business? Government sector? The 'value' of a degree is only given to by the people looking at it. Even then, there are those companies in each category that would defy the stereotypical hiring policy. So my advice to the poster who asked this question is to define who are your said 'employers' first. If you have no idea where you want to work or which sector of business you want to be in, it might serve you better to understand more about the course to see which specific programme/school/school culture might suit you better rather which degree appeals more to 'employers'. It's better to make an informed choice yourself.Spoiler!Actually, people do look at where you study. I got a couple of friends in HR. They told me that they would also look at the university, course, GPA/grades, modules taken, then any leadership roles regardless of how many years of relevant work experience a person has. Some say they tend to give more priority to old boys/girls, alum, that sort of thing. I'm not saying you're wrong here buddy, and in fact you're correct in saying this! But like I mentioned previously, it depends on where you're applying for work at, what is the company's hiring policy, what are they looking for etc. Comments like this might mislead some to think that this one degree/choice of school will make or break their future. What your friends experienced are the hiring policies of their particular companies they work at, but it's definitely not the same across various companies.There's no 'one size fits all' answer to certain questions. There is also no 'only one single path' to success. Some students don't realise it yet. This is the point that I'm driving at - Students should not be afraid to seek out multiple answers to a single question. There is always more than one way to solve a single question. Isn't that how it is for Math too? There may be one solution given in the answer book but it doesn't mean that that's the only one.If you do not get your university placing in the public schools this year, there are many other options! For poly students, you can take a gap year and work first, try again next year or the year after, like what I was planning to do myself should I not get my placing this year. Work experience ain't a bad idea too. For JC students, you can always take the A's again (like what some here are planning to do), to get a better grade for your dream course on the next application. I had a friend who couldn't get pharmaceutical, retook his A's while serving NS, scored a much better grade and went on to pharmaceutical on a scholarship in the end. If you really want to study this year, then private schools might be a viable idea as well. Yes things might not have gone according to plan for you. You might have been taught your whole life that you must get into NTU/NUS/SMU, or that might have been pressure on yourself. But fact is, if you're not getting in (even after appeal), then it's on you to take your next step forward. You have to keep moving forward in life despite the obstacles you face. If you're really rejected in the end, allow yourself to be sad for a little while, then pick yourself up, make plans, take the next step forward and move on. You might have to take a little detour, but it doesn't mean you can't get there. It's just how badly you want it. I hope this lengthy post written at 3am in the morning would encourage some of you even a little, because I know what it's like to constantly fail at every turn and have life keep pushing you down. If it did, then I'm glad. ",13.914498946647969

SMU received 1,108 applications for the 45 places in the course, which means about 25 students are vying for every place. The demand for the new course has also led to a rise in total number of applications - 14,000 in all this year, a 6 per cent rise over last year. Earlier this year, when SMU announced the new course, its officials likened it to Oxford University's prestigious politics, philosophy and economics course. It is aimed at giving students a broad understanding of how the world works and will prepare them for a range of careers. Students who had applied for the course said it is an unusual combination since it includes the study of law with economics and politics - and prestigious to boot as it is being offered to only a select group of high-calibre students. Many were also drawn by the fact that the course would prepare them for a wide range of jobs, including in journalism, foreign affairs, public service, consulting and research. SMU provost Lily Kong said she was delighted with the response. She added: "From all our engagement sessions, it is clear that students, parents and employers recognise the value that the PLE combination of disciplines can bring in preparing graduates who can handle multifaceted careers... "Through a deeper understanding of how politics, law and economics intersect to shape the world in which we live, we hope to groom a new generation of leaders and thinkers for Singapore." The 45 students selected for the course will take all three subjects in the first year, before specialising in one of four areas - global studies, distribution and justice, public policy and governance, or choice and behaviour - from year two. Students will also have to go on a 10-week internship during which they will work on a project to find solutions to a real-world problem. SMU said several firms have indicated their interest in offering internships to those on the course. They include the Economic Development Board as well as consultancies like Bain and Company. SMU officials said close to 5,000 of the 14,000 applicants have been shortlisted so far. They will be further assessed via interviews. Professor Kong said that, besides academic results, SMU uses other criteria for admission. "Exam grades are a valid measure, but they cannot be the sole measure of a student's ability." The university is the first in Singapore to require all [shortlisted] candidates to attend an interview. It started the practice 16 years ago, when 2,000 students applied to become part of its pioneer batch. Interviews are still required now, although the number of candidates shortlisted for the six undergraduate degree courses has trebled. They are conducted individually or in groups, with professors on the lookout for intellectual curiosity and leadership qualities. SMU said a select group of students - about 1,000 - with strong academic and other abilities were invited to visit the university on "SMU Discovery Day" this year. Prof Kong said: "Our engagement is directed at confirming that they are indeed an excellent match for the education that SMU offers, and for them to confirm that SMU is the university of choice for them." A-level holder Benedict Lim, 20, who applied for the PLE course, said: "I have an interest in both (law and economics) and had a hard time picking one, so when I heard about SMU's new course, I jumped at the chance." He is keen on a broad-based education as he believes it will train him to be versatile and adaptable and enable him to switch careers. "You know what they say about students having to take on jobs that don't exist today. "I really do believe that. That's why it is best to have a broad-based education, so that you have a broad understanding of issues and how the world works." Probably an inflated nunber What they shld publish rather is the number of ppl putting that as their first choice at smu",13.257581219483185
2016,Singapore Management University|smu,Nanyang Junior College|nanyang jc|nyjc|computer|com|infosys|information systems|analytics,"SINGAPORE: Three of Singapore's autonomous universities are refining the way they admit students under the Discretionary Admissions Scheme, which looks beyond a person's academic achievements. It comes as the universities prepare to take in more students under the scheme, when the current cap of 10 per cent allowed for discretionary admissions goes up to 15 per cent next year. ADVERTISING inRead invented by Teads National University of Singapore (NUS) is offering 7,000 places for the coming academic year, but it has received four times the number of applicants. While it has started handing out offers to those who made the cut based on their grades, about 1,800 students who did not are undergoing interviews to be considered for discretionary admissions this year. NUS has been evaluating and admitting more students under the scheme over the years. Last year, it evaluated 1,600 students, 400 more than 2014. 670 of them got in, 70 more than 2014. With more students expected to be considered for discretionary admissions, the process at NUS may be refined. Said Professor Tan Eng Chye, deputy president of academic affairs at NUS: “We are evolving; for instance, we have gotten alumni to help us with the interviews. I find that very useful because the alumni have a lot of experience in sizing up people and candidates, and they ask very useful questions. “We also provide more data on what to look out for and if the numbers get to be big, we may decide that maybe we can have sort of a test first - not an academic test per se, but perhaps a test to look at other non-academic aspects of that person. It could be an aptitude test.” Prof Tan added: “Exercising flexibility is one aspect; you also have to be fairly sharp on what to look for - it is not simply: 'OK, meet the numbers.' Our interest is to look for attributes of the applicants that would make the student community more interesting, more diversified, and enhance the interaction within the student community. “Those who can adequately and can eloquently convey their passions and interests - that would be advantageous. But we also have to look out for students who may not be able to communicate as well, but yet they have the potential for us to groom them to be able graduates.” At the Singapore Management University (SMU), discretionary admissions currently form about 5 to 8 per cent of the annual intake. With the higher cap of 15 per cent for such admissions next year, the university will have "more leeway" when assessing students. Professor Pang Yang Hoong, vice provost for undergraduate matters and student development at SMU, said: “For SMU, looking at students with other qualifications is not something terribly new because we always been holistic in the way we assess students and their suitability for admission. We will be more flexible. “(We look for) passion, the aptitude for the course for which we are admitting them into. It would also be ideal if students have demonstrated that they are successful to be in time management, that they also possess resilience and the ability to overcome difficult situations. This will help us to assess if that person has got the resilience and the determination to do well in the programme.” SMU is expecting more polytechnic graduates to apply through the discretionary route with the cap being raised to 15 per cent of the annual intake. Nanyang Technological University (NTU) will also "broaden the criteria", to give more people a shot at securing a place. It will favourably consider those who possess "enthusiasm and relevant work experience". Professor Kam Chan Hin, senior associate provost for undergraduate education at NTU, commented: “Normally, they will look at other achievements that they have - whether in sports, in arts … or even if they are very passionate about community service, leadership. So these are the things that we usually look for. “We are going to encourage all the schools to broaden the criteria, to allow more people who have a very strong passion, to be given the opportunity to be interviewed. We should be more adventurous, open it a bit more and ask more questions, outside of the usual parameters, and if you find somebody who is really very interesting and very passionate … give them a chance.” NTU had evaluated 1,400 students under the scheme last year and about 600 were given a place. All three universities said that even as they exercise flexibility, it is still important for students to show that they possess the "adequate academic competence" to go through the rigour and demands of a university education.  - CNA/ms",13.148333691613786

Why didn't you apply for Humanities & Social Studies instead? [Probing CCAs & Interests -2] 5. Why do you still want to choose NTU instead of NUS? [Universities Choice -3] Below are just my opinions. The interview ended surprisingly faster than expected - far less than 10 minutes. However, there were no questions related to assess my competency for ACBS, and I guess that these questions are completely the same as single degree interview. Also, I doubt they even know what I actually applied for. So for those who are applying ACBS as well, do rest assure.  Comparing NTU and SMU, I find that NTU is more rigid in the way they conduct their interviews. They seem to have a list of standardized questions to be asked. Whereas for SMU, after I spoken about my attachment in one of the Big 4, the whole conversation was all about the work I did, and how I was able to cope with stress in the environment. Very friendly professors. As such, it is much easier to control your conversation topic for SMU. Again, in my opinion, NTU is more interested in how you can contribute to NTU. Whilst for SMU, the professors really want to know you as an individual. Also, the interviewers in NTU seem to be expressionless; it feels that I was talking to robots, but at the very least they did hold eye contact with me. Both are equally efficient in conducting their interviews nevertheless. Generally agree with Aomatsu.  Just to add on, I went for the ACBS interview back in 2014, because, you know, NS, and the main interviewer was Prof Valerie. We had a rather entertaining conversation and it was more of a chit-chat session than an interview. NTU knows what courses you applied for. She had my application form in hard copy on the table (in full view) and asked me why I applied for REP as my 2nd choice, and only put Accountancy (single degree) as the 3rd choice. Other than that, the main focus was definitely on how I would contribute NTU if they offered me a place/scholarship. Of course I talked about joining some clubs in NBS, my career goals and the various competitions/events at NTU which interest me. They didn't ask me those "essay" kind of questions though, but we chatted for around 20 minutes. It was a very light-hearted and enjoyable session and it felt really short in fact. After the interview, the prof invited me to apply for the USP. I also went for the SMU interview (also in 2014) for the double degree programme in Accountancy and Business. I remember being interviewed by Prof Seow and Prof Gary Pan. They seemed really concerned about whether I applied to NUS/NTU and asked me which I would pick if I was offered all 3. It somehow gave me the impression that they were being insecure/desperate. However, I liked the fact that they gave more attention to my hobbies and interests and focused less on academic achievements. I guess this is one example of SMU's holistic admissions process. They were also constantly marketing their school throughout the interview by asking me if I knew that their school of accountancy was ranked xxx in the BYU rankings etc, and kept comparing them to the other 2 unis. What I got out of that interview was that the profs at SMU are really passionate about what they do and that they're incredibly driven especially when it comes to building the school's reputation.  At the end of the day, both are local universities. Employers will lump NUS/NTU/SMU together anyway. So in terms of employability, no difference really. Choose the school which suits your personality better.",13.142454713816718

Eat in balance, avoid eating stuff that will float your bloat, which are dairy products for me. I had tori katsu curry rice at umisushi, best $4.90 spent. 2. Eat whole fruits after lunch to regulate your blood sugar so you won't feel that sleepy. I ate papaya, banana or dragonfruits etc... 3. If you are a coffee jittery person, do not drink highly caffeinated beverages, such as myself  4. Try to keep your body calm, staying in aircon area works for me, because when I'm sweaty, I cannot focus. When I reached Bras Basah MRT, I couldn't quite find SIS, until I saw Subway ads, it says "Subway @ School of Information System *arrow*". Told the security personnel at the gantry that I'm here for interview, and she guided me to the lift Went up, signage were on walls and doors to guide me to a hole in a wall, where I was requested to complete a style-of-work survey (no right and wrong answer, just to see what is your working style) and waited for my turn. Diagonal to me sits another dude, cool dude who has Korean blood  we were guided by 2 presumably seniors into a room to do 2 things:  A) Stanford Karel; we were tasked to script a simple program. B) Estimation question; How many visitors land on plane in Singapore on Dec 2015? After we completed the two tasks, we were guided to a holding room with promotional videoes playing, anyone notice that SIS dean looks like the late Steve Job?  We waited about 20mins before the interview with presumably professors, Prof. Benjamin Gan and another lady professor We were asked to explain how we coded the script for Karel, and how we arrived at the estimated number for the estimation question Then the professors asked us some questions, "Why join SIS?", "If half way through the course, you lost interest in studying SIS then how?" Etc... Overall the interview lasted an hour, I arrived at 1.30pm, waited till 2pm before I started, and left exactly at 3pm.

2016,Singapore Management University|smu,National Junior College|national jc|njc|computer|com|infosys|information systems|analytics,"Which university? Which course of study?Aim for a course that best suits you, rather than enrol in the most lucrative one Tan Eng Chye Prof Tan is deputy president (academic affairs) and provost at the National University of Singapore. PUBLISHED 6 HOURS AGOhttp://www.straitstimes.com/singapor...ourse-of-study The university admissions season is in full swing, and this is an exciting time for students in Singapore. The tertiary education landscape here has expanded significantly, and there are now many varied and interesting pathways for students to choose from, from traditional professional degree courses in medicine or engineering, to music and the liberal arts and science. Many parents I met at the National University of Singapore's (NUS) Open Day last month remarked that they are envious of the plethora of choices their children have, and wish to be young once more. Some of you may have secured multiple offers from different universities in Singapore and overseas, and you will have to make an acceptance decision soon. But how should one decide? Every year, the Ministry of Education publishes the employment rates and median starting salaries of fresh graduates of the different degree programmes offered by local universities. I certainly hope students do not make decisions based solely on data obtained through the Graduate Employment Survey (GES). GES data provides an indication of starting salaries. Starting salaries are but a guide; they neither set the course nor determine one's career trajectory or destiny. In this volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous or "Vuca" world, one cannot predict the future or where the lucrative jobs will be. You would therefore want your university education to equip you with broad-based life skills, and develop you with the flexibility and resilience needed to pick up new knowledge, adapt to new circumstances, and exploit job opportunities across a variety of sectors throughout your lifetime of careers. Another consideration is whether and how the university course adds value to your educational journey. Some students (and parents) may look to university rankings as a measure of the strength of a university department. And there are definitely synergies between research and education. If the university department excels in research, and counts world-leading researchers in the field, it is likely that cutting-edge research will filter through to your learning experience. You will have the opportunity to be taught by highly regarded academics, and there will be plenty of opportunities to conduct research under the who's-who in the field. This is particularly valuable if you have a very strong interest in research or academia. Choosing a university that excels in your area of interest may also open up more specialised opportunities, such as advanced facilities, academic opportunities such as overseas study or research trips, as well as internships and employment opportunities with prestigious organisations in the industry. Beyond academic reputation, your choice of university will also affect your life intellectually, socially and professionally. You should evaluate the entire student experience, and whether it will suit you. Find out if the social setting on campus is what you would want to be part of. NUS has, for example, the Yale-NUS College and the University Town Residential College programmes, which offer an integrated living and learning experience, amid a collegial and intellectually vibrant setting. Another distinctive programme is the NUS Overseas Colleges programme, where students get to live, work and study in an entrepreneurial hub such as Silicon Valley, New York City or Stockholm, taking entrepreneurship classes at a partner university while working in promising entrepreneurial start-ups. All universities have carefully developed their own suite of programmes and it is worth your time and effort to find out what is on offer. Talk to the professors, and to current students. Universities hold Open Days and various outreach sessions where you can visit the campus and get first-hand information. The best-ranked university or the programme that offers you two degrees in the shortest duration may sound attractive, but they may not necessarily be what you are looking for.  Some of you may want an intensely academic experience, and to pick up as many degrees in the shortest possible time. Yet others may prefer to develop a broader range of capabilities, to try out new things, or to pursue more varied experiences. You should aim to identify a university and a course that best suits you, and not simply enrol in the most competitive or lucrative course. After all, you will be spending your next three to four years in this programme. For those of you whose grades may not meet the degree programme's published entry requirements, do not give up. All local universities have discretionary admissions schemes. Last year, NUS interviewed a record 1,600 students under the scheme, and admitted 670 students. This scheme allows universities to assess applicants more holistically, and to consider their passions and attributes such as leadership, resilience or entrepreneurial skills or talent in non-academic areas. The good news is that from the next academic year onwards, NUS, Nanyang Technological University and Singapore Management University can take in more students under the Discretionary Admissions Scheme, from 10 per cent of the annual intake currently, to up to 15 per cent. This will enable more students to enter universities on the basis of their strengths and talents, beyond academic performance. There is no perfect university. What is key is to make a considered decision with the resources and information that are available to you. Your degree should help start you on the journey to where you want to go. The knowledge, experiences and opportunities in your university life should also prepare you for life beyond your degree. As a student in Singapore, you will have up to the beginning of June to decide on your offers from most of the local universities. Whatever you eventually decide on, make the most of your university experience because, for many, it will be the best time of your life.",14.829153173214898

I was hoping to get some advice from you guys here. Firstly, Congrats to all those who have successful applications. To those who are still waiting, or got rejected, don't feel despair, i'm pretty sure you'll find your way out. Like a professional juggler once told me, his biggest lesson in juggling isn't any particular technically-advanced sleights, but this: "When the ball drops, pick it up." Simple, but means a lot. Now, my story: I am from the '94 batch. Took my A levels in 2012, flunk it really badly, because I was heavily distracted by relationship issues (broke up with my ex, which caused a whole landslide trail of problems. But that's another whole long story, and besides the point). I barely studied during A levels then, and entered the exam hall hoping to fail. But miraculously, i scraped through it, and wasn't allowed to retain in JC. The resultant problem: Straight C result, with one S grade. Devastatingly embarrassing, and was a crushing defeat. You see, I come from an IP school, and that technically means that, should I flunk my A levels, all i'm equivalent of is a Primary 6 standard. So here I am, half of my life, effectively erased on papers. I gone on to enlist in NS, and kept my report card hidden away in the "shameful" corner of my room, collecting dust. After NS, i decided to take a break, took a gap year, all these while, casting aside any thoughts on studies and the education system. I went on to completing 1 internship, and 2 other jobs, as well as backpacking around Europe, South East Asia and Australia. It was fulfilling, and definitely a worthwhile experience. But now, 3 years after receiving my poor A levels result, I finally decided to get back on to the system, and apply for university. Expectedly, even with DA (I was a former national athlete, and I had my employers write in recommendation letters), I was sorrowfully rejected. This time, it hit me hard, after all these years of "escaping", I was finally facing the music, and there and then i knew I had to do sth with my life to move on.TL;DR: I still want to enter university. I know i can do better than that "shitty" result i've got. So here's what I came for, hoping for someone to offer me some advice. Personally, I am contemplating on retaking A levels. My previous subject combination was PMEE. I know my science practical grades could no longer be used, so i have to go to a private institution to do it. I am considering going to MDIS and follow its system. (Question, does anybody have any experience or knowledge or advice on MDIS? Is it a good choice for me?) On top of that, I am intending on going for private tuition to brush up my skills, because i've heard that MDIS tutors aren't the best, or at least they aren't as good as JC MOE teachers. (So, does anybody know of any good 1-to-1 tutors, that could give you undivided attention?) Lastly, is anybody here intending to repeat A levels, I was hoping to form a study group of a couple students, and mug together, and we could encourage one another. This is my one shot, i'm giving my all, and keeping my head in the game. Thank you for reading, hope to get some responses. Really sorry to learn of your predicament. Im in a same situation as u, also from ip. Registration for re taking a levels this year as private candidate has alrdy ended. Have u tried applying to private unis such as sim? Im still waiting for smu and sim to get back to me. If all else fails, maybe we can retake together! If thats the case, i might change my combi to science instead of arts haha",14.372325656409052
2016,Singapore Management University|smu,National Junior College|national jc|njc|computer|com|infosys|information systems|analytics,"DISCLAIMER: I'd like to say that this post is not meant to flame anyone or put a negative spotlight on anyone. The examples I highlighted below are simply the comments/questions that I spotted which inspired me to write this. I wouldn't want to start a discussion about education in Singapore here, nor would this a debate for JC vs Poly. Just a little background about myself - I was a comms student in poly, did pretty average for my GPA (3.5x), missed the uni application in my first year of army, got rejected by NTU ADM last year, finally got a late acceptance letter from ADM this year. So trust me when I say I can empathise with those who are still waiting for their acceptance letter, and why some people are asking certain questions here.Spoiler!Hi guys, care to give your opinions and views on SMU Business VS NUS Statistics?  Which one will have higher demand by employers? The answer to this is simple, ask yourself where do you want to work? MNC? Local startup? The big 4? Starting your own business? Government sector? The 'value' of a degree is only given to by the people looking at it. Even then, there are those companies in each category that would defy the stereotypical hiring policy. So my advice to the poster who asked this question is to define who are your said 'employers' first. If you have no idea where you want to work or which sector of business you want to be in, it might serve you better to understand more about the course to see which specific programme/school/school culture might suit you better rather which degree appeals more to 'employers'. It's better to make an informed choice yourself.Spoiler!Actually, people do look at where you study. I got a couple of friends in HR. They told me that they would also look at the university, course, GPA/grades, modules taken, then any leadership roles regardless of how many years of relevant work experience a person has. Some say they tend to give more priority to old boys/girls, alum, that sort of thing. I'm not saying you're wrong here buddy, and in fact you're correct in saying this! But like I mentioned previously, it depends on where you're applying for work at, what is the company's hiring policy, what are they looking for etc. Comments like this might mislead some to think that this one degree/choice of school will make or break their future. What your friends experienced are the hiring policies of their particular companies they work at, but it's definitely not the same across various companies.There's no 'one size fits all' answer to certain questions. There is also no 'only one single path' to success. Some students don't realise it yet. This is the point that I'm driving at - Students should not be afraid to seek out multiple answers to a single question. There is always more than one way to solve a single question. Isn't that how it is for Math too? There may be one solution given in the answer book but it doesn't mean that that's the only one.If you do not get your university placing in the public schools this year, there are many other options! For poly students, you can take a gap year and work first, try again next year or the year after, like what I was planning to do myself should I not get my placing this year. Work experience ain't a bad idea too. For JC students, you can always take the A's again (like what some here are planning to do), to get a better grade for your dream course on the next application. I had a friend who couldn't get pharmaceutical, retook his A's while serving NS, scored a much better grade and went on to pharmaceutical on a scholarship in the end. If you really want to study this year, then private schools might be a viable idea as well. Yes things might not have gone according to plan for you. You might have been taught your whole life that you must get into NTU/NUS/SMU, or that might have been pressure on yourself. But fact is, if you're not getting in (even after appeal), then it's on you to take your next step forward. You have to keep moving forward in life despite the obstacles you face. If you're really rejected in the end, allow yourself to be sad for a little while, then pick yourself up, make plans, take the next step forward and move on. You might have to take a little detour, but it doesn't mean you can't get there. It's just how badly you want it. I hope this lengthy post written at 3am in the morning would encourage some of you even a little, because I know what it's like to constantly fail at every turn and have life keep pushing you down. If it did, then I'm glad. ",13.914498946647969

SMU received 1,108 applications for the 45 places in the course, which means about 25 students are vying for every place. The demand for the new course has also led to a rise in total number of applications - 14,000 in all this year, a 6 per cent rise over last year. Earlier this year, when SMU announced the new course, its officials likened it to Oxford University's prestigious politics, philosophy and economics course. It is aimed at giving students a broad understanding of how the world works and will prepare them for a range of careers. Students who had applied for the course said it is an unusual combination since it includes the study of law with economics and politics - and prestigious to boot as it is being offered to only a select group of high-calibre students. Many were also drawn by the fact that the course would prepare them for a wide range of jobs, including in journalism, foreign affairs, public service, consulting and research. SMU provost Lily Kong said she was delighted with the response. She added: "From all our engagement sessions, it is clear that students, parents and employers recognise the value that the PLE combination of disciplines can bring in preparing graduates who can handle multifaceted careers... "Through a deeper understanding of how politics, law and economics intersect to shape the world in which we live, we hope to groom a new generation of leaders and thinkers for Singapore." The 45 students selected for the course will take all three subjects in the first year, before specialising in one of four areas - global studies, distribution and justice, public policy and governance, or choice and behaviour - from year two. Students will also have to go on a 10-week internship during which they will work on a project to find solutions to a real-world problem. SMU said several firms have indicated their interest in offering internships to those on the course. They include the Economic Development Board as well as consultancies like Bain and Company. SMU officials said close to 5,000 of the 14,000 applicants have been shortlisted so far. They will be further assessed via interviews. Professor Kong said that, besides academic results, SMU uses other criteria for admission. "Exam grades are a valid measure, but they cannot be the sole measure of a student's ability." The university is the first in Singapore to require all [shortlisted] candidates to attend an interview. It started the practice 16 years ago, when 2,000 students applied to become part of its pioneer batch. Interviews are still required now, although the number of candidates shortlisted for the six undergraduate degree courses has trebled. They are conducted individually or in groups, with professors on the lookout for intellectual curiosity and leadership qualities. SMU said a select group of students - about 1,000 - with strong academic and other abilities were invited to visit the university on "SMU Discovery Day" this year. Prof Kong said: "Our engagement is directed at confirming that they are indeed an excellent match for the education that SMU offers, and for them to confirm that SMU is the university of choice for them." A-level holder Benedict Lim, 20, who applied for the PLE course, said: "I have an interest in both (law and economics) and had a hard time picking one, so when I heard about SMU's new course, I jumped at the chance." He is keen on a broad-based education as he believes it will train him to be versatile and adaptable and enable him to switch careers. "You know what they say about students having to take on jobs that don't exist today. "I really do believe that. That's why it is best to have a broad-based education, so that you have a broad understanding of issues and how the world works."

2016,Singapore Management University|smu,National Junior College|national jc|njc|computer|com|infosys|information systems|analytics,"SINGAPORE: Three of Singapore's autonomous universities are refining the way they admit students under the Discretionary Admissions Scheme, which looks beyond a person's academic achievements. It comes as the universities prepare to take in more students under the scheme, when the current cap of 10 per cent allowed for discretionary admissions goes up to 15 per cent next year. ADVERTISING inRead invented by Teads National University of Singapore (NUS) is offering 7,000 places for the coming academic year, but it has received four times the number of applicants. While it has started handing out offers to those who made the cut based on their grades, about 1,800 students who did not are undergoing interviews to be considered for discretionary admissions this year. NUS has been evaluating and admitting more students under the scheme over the years. Last year, it evaluated 1,600 students, 400 more than 2014. 670 of them got in, 70 more than 2014. With more students expected to be considered for discretionary admissions, the process at NUS may be refined. Said Professor Tan Eng Chye, deputy president of academic affairs at NUS: “We are evolving; for instance, we have gotten alumni to help us with the interviews. I find that very useful because the alumni have a lot of experience in sizing up people and candidates, and they ask very useful questions. “We also provide more data on what to look out for and if the numbers get to be big, we may decide that maybe we can have sort of a test first - not an academic test per se, but perhaps a test to look at other non-academic aspects of that person. It could be an aptitude test.” Prof Tan added: “Exercising flexibility is one aspect; you also have to be fairly sharp on what to look for - it is not simply: 'OK, meet the numbers.' Our interest is to look for attributes of the applicants that would make the student community more interesting, more diversified, and enhance the interaction within the student community. “Those who can adequately and can eloquently convey their passions and interests - that would be advantageous. But we also have to look out for students who may not be able to communicate as well, but yet they have the potential for us to groom them to be able graduates.” At the Singapore Management University (SMU), discretionary admissions currently form about 5 to 8 per cent of the annual intake. With the higher cap of 15 per cent for such admissions next year, the university will have "more leeway" when assessing students. Professor Pang Yang Hoong, vice provost for undergraduate matters and student development at SMU, said: “For SMU, looking at students with other qualifications is not something terribly new because we always been holistic in the way we assess students and their suitability for admission. We will be more flexible. “(We look for) passion, the aptitude for the course for which we are admitting them into. It would also be ideal if students have demonstrated that they are successful to be in time management, that they also possess resilience and the ability to overcome difficult situations. This will help us to assess if that person has got the resilience and the determination to do well in the programme.” SMU is expecting more polytechnic graduates to apply through the discretionary route with the cap being raised to 15 per cent of the annual intake. Nanyang Technological University (NTU) will also "broaden the criteria", to give more people a shot at securing a place. It will favourably consider those who possess "enthusiasm and relevant work experience". Professor Kam Chan Hin, senior associate provost for undergraduate education at NTU, commented: “Normally, they will look at other achievements that they have - whether in sports, in arts … or even if they are very passionate about community service, leadership. So these are the things that we usually look for. “We are going to encourage all the schools to broaden the criteria, to allow more people who have a very strong passion, to be given the opportunity to be interviewed. We should be more adventurous, open it a bit more and ask more questions, outside of the usual parameters, and if you find somebody who is really very interesting and very passionate … give them a chance.” NTU had evaluated 1,400 students under the scheme last year and about 600 were given a place. All three universities said that even as they exercise flexibility, it is still important for students to show that they possess the "adequate academic competence" to go through the rigour and demands of a university education.  - CNA/ms",13.148333691613786

Why didn't you apply for Humanities & Social Studies instead? [Probing CCAs & Interests -2] 5. Why do you still want to choose NTU instead of NUS? [Universities Choice -3] Below are just my opinions. The interview ended surprisingly faster than expected - far less than 10 minutes. However, there were no questions related to assess my competency for ACBS, and I guess that these questions are completely the same as single degree interview. Also, I doubt they even know what I actually applied for. So for those who are applying ACBS as well, do rest assure.  Comparing NTU and SMU, I find that NTU is more rigid in the way they conduct their interviews. They seem to have a list of standardized questions to be asked. Whereas for SMU, after I spoken about my attachment in one of the Big 4, the whole conversation was all about the work I did, and how I was able to cope with stress in the environment. Very friendly professors. As such, it is much easier to control your conversation topic for SMU. Again, in my opinion, NTU is more interested in how you can contribute to NTU. Whilst for SMU, the professors really want to know you as an individual. Also, the interviewers in NTU seem to be expressionless; it feels that I was talking to robots, but at the very least they did hold eye contact with me. Both are equally efficient in conducting their interviews nevertheless. Generally agree with Aomatsu.  Just to add on, I went for the ACBS interview back in 2014, because, you know, NS, and the main interviewer was Prof Valerie. We had a rather entertaining conversation and it was more of a chit-chat session than an interview. NTU knows what courses you applied for. She had my application form in hard copy on the table (in full view) and asked me why I applied for REP as my 2nd choice, and only put Accountancy (single degree) as the 3rd choice. Other than that, the main focus was definitely on how I would contribute NTU if they offered me a place/scholarship. Of course I talked about joining some clubs in NBS, my career goals and the various competitions/events at NTU which interest me. They didn't ask me those "essay" kind of questions though, but we chatted for around 20 minutes. It was a very light-hearted and enjoyable session and it felt really short in fact. After the interview, the prof invited me to apply for the USP. I also went for the SMU interview (also in 2014) for the double degree programme in Accountancy and Business. I remember being interviewed by Prof Seow and Prof Gary Pan. They seemed really concerned about whether I applied to NUS/NTU and asked me which I would pick if I was offered all 3. It somehow gave me the impression that they were being insecure/desperate. However, I liked the fact that they gave more attention to my hobbies and interests and focused less on academic achievements. I guess this is one example of SMU's holistic admissions process. They were also constantly marketing their school throughout the interview by asking me if I knew that their school of accountancy was ranked xxx in the BYU rankings etc, and kept comparing them to the other 2 unis. What I got out of that interview was that the profs at SMU are really passionate about what they do and that they're incredibly driven especially when it comes to building the school's reputation.  At the end of the day, both are local universities. Employers will lump NUS/NTU/SMU together anyway. So in terms of employability, no difference really. Choose the school which suits your personality better.",13.142454713816718

2016,Singapore Management University|smu,Raffles Junior College|raffles jc|rjc|computer|com|infosys|information systems|analytics,"Which university? Which course of study?Aim for a course that best suits you, rather than enrol in the most lucrative one Tan Eng Chye Prof Tan is deputy president (academic affairs) and provost at the National University of Singapore. PUBLISHED 6 HOURS AGOhttp://www.straitstimes.com/singapor...ourse-of-study The university admissions season is in full swing, and this is an exciting time for students in Singapore. The tertiary education landscape here has expanded significantly, and there are now many varied and interesting pathways for students to choose from, from traditional professional degree courses in medicine or engineering, to music and the liberal arts and science. Many parents I met at the National University of Singapore's (NUS) Open Day last month remarked that they are envious of the plethora of choices their children have, and wish to be young once more. Some of you may have secured multiple offers from different universities in Singapore and overseas, and you will have to make an acceptance decision soon. But how should one decide? Every year, the Ministry of Education publishes the employment rates and median starting salaries of fresh graduates of the different degree programmes offered by local universities. I certainly hope students do not make decisions based solely on data obtained through the Graduate Employment Survey (GES). GES data provides an indication of starting salaries. Starting salaries are but a guide; they neither set the course nor determine one's career trajectory or destiny. In this volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous or "Vuca" world, one cannot predict the future or where the lucrative jobs will be. You would therefore want your university education to equip you with broad-based life skills, and develop you with the flexibility and resilience needed to pick up new knowledge, adapt to new circumstances, and exploit job opportunities across a variety of sectors throughout your lifetime of careers. Another consideration is whether and how the university course adds value to your educational journey. Some students (and parents) may look to university rankings as a measure of the strength of a university department. And there are definitely synergies between research and education. If the university department excels in research, and counts world-leading researchers in the field, it is likely that cutting-edge research will filter through to your learning experience. You will have the opportunity to be taught by highly regarded academics, and there will be plenty of opportunities to conduct research under the who's-who in the field. This is particularly valuable if you have a very strong interest in research or academia. Choosing a university that excels in your area of interest may also open up more specialised opportunities, such as advanced facilities, academic opportunities such as overseas study or research trips, as well as internships and employment opportunities with prestigious organisations in the industry. Beyond academic reputation, your choice of university will also affect your life intellectually, socially and professionally. You should evaluate the entire student experience, and whether it will suit you. Find out if the social setting on campus is what you would want to be part of. NUS has, for example, the Yale-NUS College and the University Town Residential College programmes, which offer an integrated living and learning experience, amid a collegial and intellectually vibrant setting. Another distinctive programme is the NUS Overseas Colleges programme, where students get to live, work and study in an entrepreneurial hub such as Silicon Valley, New York City or Stockholm, taking entrepreneurship classes at a partner university while working in promising entrepreneurial start-ups. All universities have carefully developed their own suite of programmes and it is worth your time and effort to find out what is on offer. Talk to the professors, and to current students. Universities hold Open Days and various outreach sessions where you can visit the campus and get first-hand information. The best-ranked university or the programme that offers you two degrees in the shortest duration may sound attractive, but they may not necessarily be what you are looking for.  Some of you may want an intensely academic experience, and to pick up as many degrees in the shortest possible time. Yet others may prefer to develop a broader range of capabilities, to try out new things, or to pursue more varied experiences. You should aim to identify a university and a course that best suits you, and not simply enrol in the most competitive or lucrative course. After all, you will be spending your next three to four years in this programme. For those of you whose grades may not meet the degree programme's published entry requirements, do not give up. All local universities have discretionary admissions schemes. Last year, NUS interviewed a record 1,600 students under the scheme, and admitted 670 students. This scheme allows universities to assess applicants more holistically, and to consider their passions and attributes such as leadership, resilience or entrepreneurial skills or talent in non-academic areas. The good news is that from the next academic year onwards, NUS, Nanyang Technological University and Singapore Management University can take in more students under the Discretionary Admissions Scheme, from 10 per cent of the annual intake currently, to up to 15 per cent. This will enable more students to enter universities on the basis of their strengths and talents, beyond academic performance. There is no perfect university. What is key is to make a considered decision with the resources and information that are available to you. Your degree should help start you on the journey to where you want to go. The knowledge, experiences and opportunities in your university life should also prepare you for life beyond your degree. As a student in Singapore, you will have up to the beginning of June to decide on your offers from most of the local universities. Whatever you eventually decide on, make the most of your university experience because, for many, it will be the best time of your life.",14.829153173214898

I was hoping to get some advice from you guys here. Firstly, Congrats to all those who have successful applications. To those who are still waiting, or got rejected, don't feel despair, i'm pretty sure you'll find your way out. Like a professional juggler once told me, his biggest lesson in juggling isn't any particular technically-advanced sleights, but this: "When the ball drops, pick it up." Simple, but means a lot. Now, my story: I am from the '94 batch. Took my A levels in 2012, flunk it really badly, because I was heavily distracted by relationship issues (broke up with my ex, which caused a whole landslide trail of problems. But that's another whole long story, and besides the point). I barely studied during A levels then, and entered the exam hall hoping to fail. But miraculously, i scraped through it, and wasn't allowed to retain in JC. The resultant problem: Straight C result, with one S grade. Devastatingly embarrassing, and was a crushing defeat. You see, I come from an IP school, and that technically means that, should I flunk my A levels, all i'm equivalent of is a Primary 6 standard. So here I am, half of my life, effectively erased on papers. I gone on to enlist in NS, and kept my report card hidden away in the "shameful" corner of my room, collecting dust. After NS, i decided to take a break, took a gap year, all these while, casting aside any thoughts on studies and the education system. I went on to completing 1 internship, and 2 other jobs, as well as backpacking around Europe, South East Asia and Australia. It was fulfilling, and definitely a worthwhile experience. But now, 3 years after receiving my poor A levels result, I finally decided to get back on to the system, and apply for university. Expectedly, even with DA (I was a former national athlete, and I had my employers write in recommendation letters), I was sorrowfully rejected. This time, it hit me hard, after all these years of "escaping", I was finally facing the music, and there and then i knew I had to do sth with my life to move on.TL;DR: I still want to enter university. I know i can do better than that "shitty" result i've got. So here's what I came for, hoping for someone to offer me some advice. Personally, I am contemplating on retaking A levels. My previous subject combination was PMEE. I know my science practical grades could no longer be used, so i have to go to a private institution to do it. I am considering going to MDIS and follow its system. (Question, does anybody have any experience or knowledge or advice on MDIS? Is it a good choice for me?) On top of that, I am intending on going for private tuition to brush up my skills, because i've heard that MDIS tutors aren't the best, or at least they aren't as good as JC MOE teachers. (So, does anybody know of any good 1-to-1 tutors, that could give you undivided attention?) Lastly, is anybody here intending to repeat A levels, I was hoping to form a study group of a couple students, and mug together, and we could encourage one another. This is my one shot, i'm giving my all, and keeping my head in the game. Thank you for reading, hope to get some responses. Really sorry to learn of your predicament. Im in a same situation as u, also from ip. Registration for re taking a levels this year as private candidate has alrdy ended. Have u tried applying to private unis such as sim? Im still waiting for smu and sim to get back to me. If all else fails, maybe we can retake together! If thats the case, i might change my combi to science instead of arts haha",14.372325656409052
2016,Singapore Management University|smu,Raffles Junior College|raffles jc|rjc|computer|com|infosys|information systems|analytics,"DISCLAIMER: I'd like to say that this post is not meant to flame anyone or put a negative spotlight on anyone. The examples I highlighted below are simply the comments/questions that I spotted which inspired me to write this. I wouldn't want to start a discussion about education in Singapore here, nor would this a debate for JC vs Poly. Just a little background about myself - I was a comms student in poly, did pretty average for my GPA (3.5x), missed the uni application in my first year of army, got rejected by NTU ADM last year, finally got a late acceptance letter from ADM this year. So trust me when I say I can empathise with those who are still waiting for their acceptance letter, and why some people are asking certain questions here.Spoiler!Hi guys, care to give your opinions and views on SMU Business VS NUS Statistics?  Which one will have higher demand by employers? The answer to this is simple, ask yourself where do you want to work? MNC? Local startup? The big 4? Starting your own business? Government sector? The 'value' of a degree is only given to by the people looking at it. Even then, there are those companies in each category that would defy the stereotypical hiring policy. So my advice to the poster who asked this question is to define who are your said 'employers' first. If you have no idea where you want to work or which sector of business you want to be in, it might serve you better to understand more about the course to see which specific programme/school/school culture might suit you better rather which degree appeals more to 'employers'. It's better to make an informed choice yourself.Spoiler!Actually, people do look at where you study. I got a couple of friends in HR. They told me that they would also look at the university, course, GPA/grades, modules taken, then any leadership roles regardless of how many years of relevant work experience a person has. Some say they tend to give more priority to old boys/girls, alum, that sort of thing. I'm not saying you're wrong here buddy, and in fact you're correct in saying this! But like I mentioned previously, it depends on where you're applying for work at, what is the company's hiring policy, what are they looking for etc. Comments like this might mislead some to think that this one degree/choice of school will make or break their future. What your friends experienced are the hiring policies of their particular companies they work at, but it's definitely not the same across various companies.There's no 'one size fits all' answer to certain questions. There is also no 'only one single path' to success. Some students don't realise it yet. This is the point that I'm driving at - Students should not be afraid to seek out multiple answers to a single question. There is always more than one way to solve a single question. Isn't that how it is for Math too? There may be one solution given in the answer book but it doesn't mean that that's the only one.If you do not get your university placing in the public schools this year, there are many other options! For poly students, you can take a gap year and work first, try again next year or the year after, like what I was planning to do myself should I not get my placing this year. Work experience ain't a bad idea too. For JC students, you can always take the A's again (like what some here are planning to do), to get a better grade for your dream course on the next application. I had a friend who couldn't get pharmaceutical, retook his A's while serving NS, scored a much better grade and went on to pharmaceutical on a scholarship in the end. If you really want to study this year, then private schools might be a viable idea as well. Yes things might not have gone according to plan for you. You might have been taught your whole life that you must get into NTU/NUS/SMU, or that might have been pressure on yourself. But fact is, if you're not getting in (even after appeal), then it's on you to take your next step forward. You have to keep moving forward in life despite the obstacles you face. If you're really rejected in the end, allow yourself to be sad for a little while, then pick yourself up, make plans, take the next step forward and move on. You might have to take a little detour, but it doesn't mean you can't get there. It's just how badly you want it. I hope this lengthy post written at 3am in the morning would encourage some of you even a little, because I know what it's like to constantly fail at every turn and have life keep pushing you down. If it did, then I'm glad. ",13.914498946647969

SMU received 1,108 applications for the 45 places in the course, which means about 25 students are vying for every place. The demand for the new course has also led to a rise in total number of applications - 14,000 in all this year, a 6 per cent rise over last year. Earlier this year, when SMU announced the new course, its officials likened it to Oxford University's prestigious politics, philosophy and economics course. It is aimed at giving students a broad understanding of how the world works and will prepare them for a range of careers. Students who had applied for the course said it is an unusual combination since it includes the study of law with economics and politics - and prestigious to boot as it is being offered to only a select group of high-calibre students. Many were also drawn by the fact that the course would prepare them for a wide range of jobs, including in journalism, foreign affairs, public service, consulting and research. SMU provost Lily Kong said she was delighted with the response. She added: "From all our engagement sessions, it is clear that students, parents and employers recognise the value that the PLE combination of disciplines can bring in preparing graduates who can handle multifaceted careers... "Through a deeper understanding of how politics, law and economics intersect to shape the world in which we live, we hope to groom a new generation of leaders and thinkers for Singapore." The 45 students selected for the course will take all three subjects in the first year, before specialising in one of four areas - global studies, distribution and justice, public policy and governance, or choice and behaviour - from year two. Students will also have to go on a 10-week internship during which they will work on a project to find solutions to a real-world problem. SMU said several firms have indicated their interest in offering internships to those on the course. They include the Economic Development Board as well as consultancies like Bain and Company. SMU officials said close to 5,000 of the 14,000 applicants have been shortlisted so far. They will be further assessed via interviews. Professor Kong said that, besides academic results, SMU uses other criteria for admission. "Exam grades are a valid measure, but they cannot be the sole measure of a student's ability." The university is the first in Singapore to require all [shortlisted] candidates to attend an interview. It started the practice 16 years ago, when 2,000 students applied to become part of its pioneer batch. Interviews are still required now, although the number of candidates shortlisted for the six undergraduate degree courses has trebled. They are conducted individually or in groups, with professors on the lookout for intellectual curiosity and leadership qualities. SMU said a select group of students - about 1,000 - with strong academic and other abilities were invited to visit the university on "SMU Discovery Day" this year. Prof Kong said: "Our engagement is directed at confirming that they are indeed an excellent match for the education that SMU offers, and for them to confirm that SMU is the university of choice for them." A-level holder Benedict Lim, 20, who applied for the PLE course, said: "I have an interest in both (law and economics) and had a hard time picking one, so when I heard about SMU's new course, I jumped at the chance." He is keen on a broad-based education as he believes it will train him to be versatile and adaptable and enable him to switch careers. "You know what they say about students having to take on jobs that don't exist today. "I really do believe that. That's why it is best to have a broad-based education, so that you have a broad understanding of issues and how the world works." Probably an inflated nunber What they shld publish rather is the number of ppl putting that as their first choice at smu",13.257581219483185
2016,Singapore Management University|smu,Raffles Junior College|raffles jc|rjc|computer|com|infosys|information systems|analytics,"SINGAPORE: Three of Singapore's autonomous universities are refining the way they admit students under the Discretionary Admissions Scheme, which looks beyond a person's academic achievements. It comes as the universities prepare to take in more students under the scheme, when the current cap of 10 per cent allowed for discretionary admissions goes up to 15 per cent next year. ADVERTISING inRead invented by Teads National University of Singapore (NUS) is offering 7,000 places for the coming academic year, but it has received four times the number of applicants. While it has started handing out offers to those who made the cut based on their grades, about 1,800 students who did not are undergoing interviews to be considered for discretionary admissions this year. NUS has been evaluating and admitting more students under the scheme over the years. Last year, it evaluated 1,600 students, 400 more than 2014. 670 of them got in, 70 more than 2014. With more students expected to be considered for discretionary admissions, the process at NUS may be refined. Said Professor Tan Eng Chye, deputy president of academic affairs at NUS: “We are evolving; for instance, we have gotten alumni to help us with the interviews. I find that very useful because the alumni have a lot of experience in sizing up people and candidates, and they ask very useful questions. “We also provide more data on what to look out for and if the numbers get to be big, we may decide that maybe we can have sort of a test first - not an academic test per se, but perhaps a test to look at other non-academic aspects of that person. It could be an aptitude test.” Prof Tan added: “Exercising flexibility is one aspect; you also have to be fairly sharp on what to look for - it is not simply: 'OK, meet the numbers.' Our interest is to look for attributes of the applicants that would make the student community more interesting, more diversified, and enhance the interaction within the student community. “Those who can adequately and can eloquently convey their passions and interests - that would be advantageous. But we also have to look out for students who may not be able to communicate as well, but yet they have the potential for us to groom them to be able graduates.” At the Singapore Management University (SMU), discretionary admissions currently form about 5 to 8 per cent of the annual intake. With the higher cap of 15 per cent for such admissions next year, the university will have "more leeway" when assessing students. Professor Pang Yang Hoong, vice provost for undergraduate matters and student development at SMU, said: “For SMU, looking at students with other qualifications is not something terribly new because we always been holistic in the way we assess students and their suitability for admission. We will be more flexible. “(We look for) passion, the aptitude for the course for which we are admitting them into. It would also be ideal if students have demonstrated that they are successful to be in time management, that they also possess resilience and the ability to overcome difficult situations. This will help us to assess if that person has got the resilience and the determination to do well in the programme.” SMU is expecting more polytechnic graduates to apply through the discretionary route with the cap being raised to 15 per cent of the annual intake. Nanyang Technological University (NTU) will also "broaden the criteria", to give more people a shot at securing a place. It will favourably consider those who possess "enthusiasm and relevant work experience". Professor Kam Chan Hin, senior associate provost for undergraduate education at NTU, commented: “Normally, they will look at other achievements that they have - whether in sports, in arts … or even if they are very passionate about community service, leadership. So these are the things that we usually look for. “We are going to encourage all the schools to broaden the criteria, to allow more people who have a very strong passion, to be given the opportunity to be interviewed. We should be more adventurous, open it a bit more and ask more questions, outside of the usual parameters, and if you find somebody who is really very interesting and very passionate … give them a chance.” NTU had evaluated 1,400 students under the scheme last year and about 600 were given a place. All three universities said that even as they exercise flexibility, it is still important for students to show that they possess the "adequate academic competence" to go through the rigour and demands of a university education.  - CNA/ms",13.148333691613786

The interview ended surprisingly faster than expected - far less than 10 minutes. However, there were no questions related to assess my competency for ACBS, and I guess that these questions are completely the same as single degree interview. Also, I doubt they even know what I actually applied for. So for those who are applying ACBS as well, do rest assure.  Comparing NTU and SMU, I find that NTU is more rigid in the way they conduct their interviews. They seem to have a list of standardized questions to be asked. Whereas for SMU, after I spoken about my attachment in one of the Big 4, the whole conversation was all about the work I did, and how I was able to cope with stress in the environment. Very friendly professors. As such, it is much easier to control your conversation topic for SMU. Again, in my opinion, NTU is more interested in how you can contribute to NTU. Whilst for SMU, the professors really want to know you as an individual. Also, the interviewers in NTU seem to be expressionless; it feels that I was talking to robots, but at the very least they did hold eye contact with me. Both are equally efficient in conducting their interviews nevertheless. Generally agree with Aomatsu.  Just to add on, I went for the ACBS interview back in 2014, because, you know, NS, and the main interviewer was Prof Valerie. We had a rather entertaining conversation and it was more of a chit-chat session than an interview. NTU knows what courses you applied for. She had my application form in hard copy on the table (in full view) and asked me why I applied for REP as my 2nd choice, and only put Accountancy (single degree) as the 3rd choice. Other than that, the main focus was definitely on how I would contribute NTU if they offered me a place/scholarship. Of course I talked about joining some clubs in NBS, my career goals and the various competitions/events at NTU which interest me. They didn't ask me those "essay" kind of questions though, but we chatted for around 20 minutes. It was a very light-hearted and enjoyable session and it felt really short in fact. After the interview, the prof invited me to apply for the USP. I also went for the SMU interview (also in 2014) for the double degree programme in Accountancy and Business. I remember being interviewed by Prof Seow and Prof Gary Pan. They seemed really concerned about whether I applied to NUS/NTU and asked me which I would pick if I was offered all 3. It somehow gave me the impression that they were being insecure/desperate. However, I liked the fact that they gave more attention to my hobbies and interests and focused less on academic achievements. I guess this is one example of SMU's holistic admissions process. They were also constantly marketing their school throughout the interview by asking me if I knew that their school of accountancy was ranked xxx in the BYU rankings etc, and kept comparing them to the other 2 unis. What I got out of that interview was that the profs at SMU are really passionate about what they do and that they're incredibly driven especially when it comes to building the school's reputation.  At the end of the day, both are local universities. Employers will lump NUS/NTU/SMU together anyway. So in terms of employability, no difference really. Choose the school which suits your personality better.",13.142454713816718
2016,Singapore Management University|smu,Raffles Junior College|raffles jc|rjc|computer|com|infosys|information systems|analytics,"New SMU course: 1,108 vying for 45 placesCombination of politics, law and economics proves a winner; total number of applications up 6% to 14,000 Sandra Davie, Senior Education Correspondenthttp://www.straitstimes.com/singapor...-for-45-places A new degree course at Singapore Management University (SMU) which offers a combination of politics, law and economics (PLE) is a hit with young Singaporeans hoping to land a university place this year. SMU received 1,108 applications for the 45 places in the course, which means about 25 students are vying for every place. The demand for the new course has also led to a rise in total number of applications - 14,000 in all this year, a 6 per cent rise over last year. Earlier this year, when SMU announced the new course, its officials likened it to Oxford University's prestigious politics, philosophy and economics course. It is aimed at giving students a broad understanding of how the world works and will prepare them for a range of careers. Students who had applied for the course said it is an unusual combination since it includes the study of law with economics and politics - and prestigious to boot as it is being offered to only a select group of high-calibre students. Many were also drawn by the fact that the course would prepare them for a wide range of jobs, including in journalism, foreign affairs, public service, consulting and research. SMU provost Lily Kong said she was delighted with the response. She added: "From all our engagement sessions, it is clear that students, parents and employers recognise the value that the PLE combination of disciplines can bring in preparing graduates who can handle multifaceted careers... "Through a deeper understanding of how politics, law and economics intersect to shape the world in which we live, we hope to groom a new generation of leaders and thinkers for Singapore." The 45 students selected for the course will take all three subjects in the first year, before specialising in one of four areas - global studies, distribution and justice, public policy and governance, or choice and behaviour - from year two. Students will also have to go on a 10-week internship during which they will work on a project to find solutions to a real-world problem. SMU said several firms have indicated their interest in offering internships to those on the course. They include the Economic Development Board as well as consultancies like Bain and Company. SMU officials said close to 5,000 of the 14,000 applicants have been shortlisted so far. They will be further assessed via interviews. Professor Kong said that, besides academic results, SMU uses other criteria for admission. "Exam grades are a valid measure, but they cannot be the sole measure of a student's ability." The university is the first in Singapore to require all [shortlisted] candidates to attend an interview. It started the practice 16 years ago, when 2,000 students applied to become part of its pioneer batch. Interviews are still required now, although the number of candidates shortlisted for the six undergraduate degree courses has trebled. They are conducted individually or in groups, with professors on the lookout for intellectual curiosity and leadership qualities. SMU said a select group of students - about 1,000 - with strong academic and other abilities were invited to visit the university on "SMU Discovery Day" this year. Prof Kong said: "Our engagement is directed at confirming that they are indeed an excellent match for the education that SMU offers, and for them to confirm that SMU is the university of choice for them." A-level holder Benedict Lim, 20, who applied for the PLE course, said: "I have an interest in both (law and economics) and had a hard time picking one, so when I heard about SMU's new course, I jumped at the chance." He is keen on a broad-based education as he believes it will train him to be versatile and adaptable and enable him to switch careers. "You know what they say about students having to take on jobs that don't exist today. "I really do believe that. That's why it is best to have a broad-based education, so that you have a broad understanding of issues and how the world works."",12.996025800973168

2016,Singapore Management University|smu,Saint Andrew's Junior College|saint andrews junior college|saint andrews jc|sajc|computer|com|infosys|information systems|analytics,"Which university? Which course of study?Aim for a course that best suits you, rather than enrol in the most lucrative one Tan Eng Chye Prof Tan is deputy president (academic affairs) and provost at the National University of Singapore. PUBLISHED 6 HOURS AGOhttp://www.straitstimes.com/singapor...ourse-of-study The university admissions season is in full swing, and this is an exciting time for students in Singapore. The tertiary education landscape here has expanded significantly, and there are now many varied and interesting pathways for students to choose from, from traditional professional degree courses in medicine or engineering, to music and the liberal arts and science. Many parents I met at the National University of Singapore's (NUS) Open Day last month remarked that they are envious of the plethora of choices their children have, and wish to be young once more. Some of you may have secured multiple offers from different universities in Singapore and overseas, and you will have to make an acceptance decision soon. But how should one decide? Every year, the Ministry of Education publishes the employment rates and median starting salaries of fresh graduates of the different degree programmes offered by local universities. I certainly hope students do not make decisions based solely on data obtained through the Graduate Employment Survey (GES). GES data provides an indication of starting salaries. Starting salaries are but a guide; they neither set the course nor determine one's career trajectory or destiny. In this volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous or "Vuca" world, one cannot predict the future or where the lucrative jobs will be. You would therefore want your university education to equip you with broad-based life skills, and develop you with the flexibility and resilience needed to pick up new knowledge, adapt to new circumstances, and exploit job opportunities across a variety of sectors throughout your lifetime of careers. Another consideration is whether and how the university course adds value to your educational journey. Some students (and parents) may look to university rankings as a measure of the strength of a university department. And there are definitely synergies between research and education. If the university department excels in research, and counts world-leading researchers in the field, it is likely that cutting-edge research will filter through to your learning experience. You will have the opportunity to be taught by highly regarded academics, and there will be plenty of opportunities to conduct research under the who's-who in the field. This is particularly valuable if you have a very strong interest in research or academia. Choosing a university that excels in your area of interest may also open up more specialised opportunities, such as advanced facilities, academic opportunities such as overseas study or research trips, as well as internships and employment opportunities with prestigious organisations in the industry. Beyond academic reputation, your choice of university will also affect your life intellectually, socially and professionally. You should evaluate the entire student experience, and whether it will suit you. Find out if the social setting on campus is what you would want to be part of. NUS has, for example, the Yale-NUS College and the University Town Residential College programmes, which offer an integrated living and learning experience, amid a collegial and intellectually vibrant setting. Another distinctive programme is the NUS Overseas Colleges programme, where students get to live, work and study in an entrepreneurial hub such as Silicon Valley, New York City or Stockholm, taking entrepreneurship classes at a partner university while working in promising entrepreneurial start-ups. All universities have carefully developed their own suite of programmes and it is worth your time and effort to find out what is on offer. Talk to the professors, and to current students. Universities hold Open Days and various outreach sessions where you can visit the campus and get first-hand information. The best-ranked university or the programme that offers you two degrees in the shortest duration may sound attractive, but they may not necessarily be what you are looking for.  Some of you may want an intensely academic experience, and to pick up as many degrees in the shortest possible time. Yet others may prefer to develop a broader range of capabilities, to try out new things, or to pursue more varied experiences. You should aim to identify a university and a course that best suits you, and not simply enrol in the most competitive or lucrative course. After all, you will be spending your next three to four years in this programme. For those of you whose grades may not meet the degree programme's published entry requirements, do not give up. All local universities have discretionary admissions schemes. Last year, NUS interviewed a record 1,600 students under the scheme, and admitted 670 students. This scheme allows universities to assess applicants more holistically, and to consider their passions and attributes such as leadership, resilience or entrepreneurial skills or talent in non-academic areas. The good news is that from the next academic year onwards, NUS, Nanyang Technological University and Singapore Management University can take in more students under the Discretionary Admissions Scheme, from 10 per cent of the annual intake currently, to up to 15 per cent. This will enable more students to enter universities on the basis of their strengths and talents, beyond academic performance. There is no perfect university. What is key is to make a considered decision with the resources and information that are available to you. Your degree should help start you on the journey to where you want to go. The knowledge, experiences and opportunities in your university life should also prepare you for life beyond your degree. As a student in Singapore, you will have up to the beginning of June to decide on your offers from most of the local universities. Whatever you eventually decide on, make the most of your university experience because, for many, it will be the best time of your life.",14.829153173214898

I was hoping to get some advice from you guys here. Firstly, Congrats to all those who have successful applications. To those who are still waiting, or got rejected, don't feel despair, i'm pretty sure you'll find your way out. Like a professional juggler once told me, his biggest lesson in juggling isn't any particular technically-advanced sleights, but this: "When the ball drops, pick it up." Simple, but means a lot. Now, my story: I am from the '94 batch. Took my A levels in 2012, flunk it really badly, because I was heavily distracted by relationship issues (broke up with my ex, which caused a whole landslide trail of problems. But that's another whole long story, and besides the point). I barely studied during A levels then, and entered the exam hall hoping to fail. But miraculously, i scraped through it, and wasn't allowed to retain in JC. The resultant problem: Straight C result, with one S grade. Devastatingly embarrassing, and was a crushing defeat. You see, I come from an IP school, and that technically means that, should I flunk my A levels, all i'm equivalent of is a Primary 6 standard. So here I am, half of my life, effectively erased on papers. I gone on to enlist in NS, and kept my report card hidden away in the "shameful" corner of my room, collecting dust. After NS, i decided to take a break, took a gap year, all these while, casting aside any thoughts on studies and the education system. I went on to completing 1 internship, and 2 other jobs, as well as backpacking around Europe, South East Asia and Australia. It was fulfilling, and definitely a worthwhile experience. But now, 3 years after receiving my poor A levels result, I finally decided to get back on to the system, and apply for university. Expectedly, even with DA (I was a former national athlete, and I had my employers write in recommendation letters), I was sorrowfully rejected. This time, it hit me hard, after all these years of "escaping", I was finally facing the music, and there and then i knew I had to do sth with my life to move on.TL;DR: I still want to enter university. I know i can do better than that "shitty" result i've got. So here's what I came for, hoping for someone to offer me some advice. Personally, I am contemplating on retaking A levels. My previous subject combination was PMEE. I know my science practical grades could no longer be used, so i have to go to a private institution to do it. I am considering going to MDIS and follow its system. (Question, does anybody have any experience or knowledge or advice on MDIS? Is it a good choice for me?) On top of that, I am intending on going for private tuition to brush up my skills, because i've heard that MDIS tutors aren't the best, or at least they aren't as good as JC MOE teachers. (So, does anybody know of any good 1-to-1 tutors, that could give you undivided attention?) Lastly, is anybody here intending to repeat A levels, I was hoping to form a study group of a couple students, and mug together, and we could encourage one another. This is my one shot, i'm giving my all, and keeping my head in the game. Thank you for reading, hope to get some responses. Really sorry to learn of your predicament. Im in a same situation as u, also from ip. Registration for re taking a levels this year as private candidate has alrdy ended. Have u tried applying to private unis such as sim? Im still waiting for smu and sim to get back to me. If all else fails, maybe we can retake together! If thats the case, i might change my combi to science instead of arts haha",14.372325656409052
2016,Singapore Management University|smu,Saint Andrew's Junior College|saint andrews junior college|saint andrews jc|sajc|computer|com|infosys|information systems|analytics,"DISCLAIMER: I'd like to say that this post is not meant to flame anyone or put a negative spotlight on anyone. The examples I highlighted below are simply the comments/questions that I spotted which inspired me to write this. I wouldn't want to start a discussion about education in Singapore here, nor would this a debate for JC vs Poly. Just a little background about myself - I was a comms student in poly, did pretty average for my GPA (3.5x), missed the uni application in my first year of army, got rejected by NTU ADM last year, finally got a late acceptance letter from ADM this year. So trust me when I say I can empathise with those who are still waiting for their acceptance letter, and why some people are asking certain questions here.Spoiler!Hi guys, care to give your opinions and views on SMU Business VS NUS Statistics?  Which one will have higher demand by employers? The answer to this is simple, ask yourself where do you want to work? MNC? Local startup? The big 4? Starting your own business? Government sector? The 'value' of a degree is only given to by the people looking at it. Even then, there are those companies in each category that would defy the stereotypical hiring policy. So my advice to the poster who asked this question is to define who are your said 'employers' first. If you have no idea where you want to work or which sector of business you want to be in, it might serve you better to understand more about the course to see which specific programme/school/school culture might suit you better rather which degree appeals more to 'employers'. It's better to make an informed choice yourself.Spoiler!Actually, people do look at where you study. I got a couple of friends in HR. They told me that they would also look at the university, course, GPA/grades, modules taken, then any leadership roles regardless of how many years of relevant work experience a person has. Some say they tend to give more priority to old boys/girls, alum, that sort of thing. I'm not saying you're wrong here buddy, and in fact you're correct in saying this! But like I mentioned previously, it depends on where you're applying for work at, what is the company's hiring policy, what are they looking for etc. Comments like this might mislead some to think that this one degree/choice of school will make or break their future. What your friends experienced are the hiring policies of their particular companies they work at, but it's definitely not the same across various companies.There's no 'one size fits all' answer to certain questions. There is also no 'only one single path' to success. Some students don't realise it yet. This is the point that I'm driving at - Students should not be afraid to seek out multiple answers to a single question. There is always more than one way to solve a single question. Isn't that how it is for Math too? There may be one solution given in the answer book but it doesn't mean that that's the only one.If you do not get your university placing in the public schools this year, there are many other options! For poly students, you can take a gap year and work first, try again next year or the year after, like what I was planning to do myself should I not get my placing this year. Work experience ain't a bad idea too. For JC students, you can always take the A's again (like what some here are planning to do), to get a better grade for your dream course on the next application. I had a friend who couldn't get pharmaceutical, retook his A's while serving NS, scored a much better grade and went on to pharmaceutical on a scholarship in the end. If you really want to study this year, then private schools might be a viable idea as well. Yes things might not have gone according to plan for you. You might have been taught your whole life that you must get into NTU/NUS/SMU, or that might have been pressure on yourself. But fact is, if you're not getting in (even after appeal), then it's on you to take your next step forward. You have to keep moving forward in life despite the obstacles you face. If you're really rejected in the end, allow yourself to be sad for a little while, then pick yourself up, make plans, take the next step forward and move on. You might have to take a little detour, but it doesn't mean you can't get there. It's just how badly you want it. I hope this lengthy post written at 3am in the morning would encourage some of you even a little, because I know what it's like to constantly fail at every turn and have life keep pushing you down. If it did, then I'm glad. ",13.914498946647969

2016,Singapore Management University|smu,Saint Andrew's Junior College|saint andrews junior college|saint andrews jc|sajc|computer|com|infosys|information systems|analytics,"SINGAPORE: Three of Singapore's autonomous universities are refining the way they admit students under the Discretionary Admissions Scheme, which looks beyond a person's academic achievements. It comes as the universities prepare to take in more students under the scheme, when the current cap of 10 per cent allowed for discretionary admissions goes up to 15 per cent next year. ADVERTISING inRead invented by Teads National University of Singapore (NUS) is offering 7,000 places for the coming academic year, but it has received four times the number of applicants. While it has started handing out offers to those who made the cut based on their grades, about 1,800 students who did not are undergoing interviews to be considered for discretionary admissions this year. NUS has been evaluating and admitting more students under the scheme over the years. Last year, it evaluated 1,600 students, 400 more than 2014. 670 of them got in, 70 more than 2014. With more students expected to be considered for discretionary admissions, the process at NUS may be refined. Said Professor Tan Eng Chye, deputy president of academic affairs at NUS: “We are evolving; for instance, we have gotten alumni to help us with the interviews. I find that very useful because the alumni have a lot of experience in sizing up people and candidates, and they ask very useful questions. “We also provide more data on what to look out for and if the numbers get to be big, we may decide that maybe we can have sort of a test first - not an academic test per se, but perhaps a test to look at other non-academic aspects of that person. It could be an aptitude test.” Prof Tan added: “Exercising flexibility is one aspect; you also have to be fairly sharp on what to look for - it is not simply: 'OK, meet the numbers.' Our interest is to look for attributes of the applicants that would make the student community more interesting, more diversified, and enhance the interaction within the student community. “Those who can adequately and can eloquently convey their passions and interests - that would be advantageous. But we also have to look out for students who may not be able to communicate as well, but yet they have the potential for us to groom them to be able graduates.” At the Singapore Management University (SMU), discretionary admissions currently form about 5 to 8 per cent of the annual intake. With the higher cap of 15 per cent for such admissions next year, the university will have "more leeway" when assessing students. Professor Pang Yang Hoong, vice provost for undergraduate matters and student development at SMU, said: “For SMU, looking at students with other qualifications is not something terribly new because we always been holistic in the way we assess students and their suitability for admission. We will be more flexible. “(We look for) passion, the aptitude for the course for which we are admitting them into. It would also be ideal if students have demonstrated that they are successful to be in time management, that they also possess resilience and the ability to overcome difficult situations. This will help us to assess if that person has got the resilience and the determination to do well in the programme.” SMU is expecting more polytechnic graduates to apply through the discretionary route with the cap being raised to 15 per cent of the annual intake. Nanyang Technological University (NTU) will also "broaden the criteria", to give more people a shot at securing a place. It will favourably consider those who possess "enthusiasm and relevant work experience". Professor Kam Chan Hin, senior associate provost for undergraduate education at NTU, commented: “Normally, they will look at other achievements that they have - whether in sports, in arts … or even if they are very passionate about community service, leadership. So these are the things that we usually look for. “We are going to encourage all the schools to broaden the criteria, to allow more people who have a very strong passion, to be given the opportunity to be interviewed. We should be more adventurous, open it a bit more and ask more questions, outside of the usual parameters, and if you find somebody who is really very interesting and very passionate … give them a chance.” NTU had evaluated 1,400 students under the scheme last year and about 600 were given a place. All three universities said that even as they exercise flexibility, it is still important for students to show that they possess the "adequate academic competence" to go through the rigour and demands of a university education.  - CNA/ms",13.148333691613786

Why didn't you apply for Humanities & Social Studies instead? [Probing CCAs & Interests -2] 5. Why do you still want to choose NTU instead of NUS? [Universities Choice -3] Below are just my opinions. The interview ended surprisingly faster than expected - far less than 10 minutes. However, there were no questions related to assess my competency for ACBS, and I guess that these questions are completely the same as single degree interview. Also, I doubt they even know what I actually applied for. So for those who are applying ACBS as well, do rest assure.  Comparing NTU and SMU, I find that NTU is more rigid in the way they conduct their interviews. They seem to have a list of standardized questions to be asked. Whereas for SMU, after I spoken about my attachment in one of the Big 4, the whole conversation was all about the work I did, and how I was able to cope with stress in the environment. Very friendly professors. As such, it is much easier to control your conversation topic for SMU. Again, in my opinion, NTU is more interested in how you can contribute to NTU. Whilst for SMU, the professors really want to know you as an individual. Also, the interviewers in NTU seem to be expressionless; it feels that I was talking to robots, but at the very least they did hold eye contact with me. Both are equally efficient in conducting their interviews nevertheless. Generally agree with Aomatsu.  Just to add on, I went for the ACBS interview back in 2014, because, you know, NS, and the main interviewer was Prof Valerie. We had a rather entertaining conversation and it was more of a chit-chat session than an interview. NTU knows what courses you applied for. She had my application form in hard copy on the table (in full view) and asked me why I applied for REP as my 2nd choice, and only put Accountancy (single degree) as the 3rd choice. Other than that, the main focus was definitely on how I would contribute NTU if they offered me a place/scholarship. Of course I talked about joining some clubs in NBS, my career goals and the various competitions/events at NTU which interest me. They didn't ask me those "essay" kind of questions though, but we chatted for around 20 minutes. It was a very light-hearted and enjoyable session and it felt really short in fact. After the interview, the prof invited me to apply for the USP. I also went for the SMU interview (also in 2014) for the double degree programme in Accountancy and Business. I remember being interviewed by Prof Seow and Prof Gary Pan. They seemed really concerned about whether I applied to NUS/NTU and asked me which I would pick if I was offered all 3. It somehow gave me the impression that they were being insecure/desperate. However, I liked the fact that they gave more attention to my hobbies and interests and focused less on academic achievements. I guess this is one example of SMU's holistic admissions process. They were also constantly marketing their school throughout the interview by asking me if I knew that their school of accountancy was ranked xxx in the BYU rankings etc, and kept comparing them to the other 2 unis. What I got out of that interview was that the profs at SMU are really passionate about what they do and that they're incredibly driven especially when it comes to building the school's reputation.  At the end of the day, both are local universities. Employers will lump NUS/NTU/SMU together anyway. So in terms of employability, no difference really. Choose the school which suits your personality better.",13.142454713816718
2016,Singapore Management University|smu,Saint Andrew's Junior College|saint andrews junior college|saint andrews jc|sajc|computer|com|infosys|information systems|analytics,"New SMU course: 1,108 vying for 45 placesCombination of politics, law and economics proves a winner; total number of applications up 6% to 14,000 Sandra Davie, Senior Education Correspondenthttp://www.straitstimes.com/singapor...-for-45-places A new degree course at Singapore Management University (SMU) which offers a combination of politics, law and economics (PLE) is a hit with young Singaporeans hoping to land a university place this year. SMU received 1,108 applications for the 45 places in the course, which means about 25 students are vying for every place. The demand for the new course has also led to a rise in total number of applications - 14,000 in all this year, a 6 per cent rise over last year. Earlier this year, when SMU announced the new course, its officials likened it to Oxford University's prestigious politics, philosophy and economics course. It is aimed at giving students a broad understanding of how the world works and will prepare them for a range of careers. Students who had applied for the course said it is an unusual combination since it includes the study of law with economics and politics - and prestigious to boot as it is being offered to only a select group of high-calibre students. Many were also drawn by the fact that the course would prepare them for a wide range of jobs, including in journalism, foreign affairs, public service, consulting and research. SMU provost Lily Kong said she was delighted with the response. She added: "From all our engagement sessions, it is clear that students, parents and employers recognise the value that the PLE combination of disciplines can bring in preparing graduates who can handle multifaceted careers... "Through a deeper understanding of how politics, law and economics intersect to shape the world in which we live, we hope to groom a new generation of leaders and thinkers for Singapore." The 45 students selected for the course will take all three subjects in the first year, before specialising in one of four areas - global studies, distribution and justice, public policy and governance, or choice and behaviour - from year two. Students will also have to go on a 10-week internship during which they will work on a project to find solutions to a real-world problem. SMU said several firms have indicated their interest in offering internships to those on the course. They include the Economic Development Board as well as consultancies like Bain and Company. SMU officials said close to 5,000 of the 14,000 applicants have been shortlisted so far. They will be further assessed via interviews. Professor Kong said that, besides academic results, SMU uses other criteria for admission. "Exam grades are a valid measure, but they cannot be the sole measure of a student's ability." The university is the first in Singapore to require all [shortlisted] candidates to attend an interview. It started the practice 16 years ago, when 2,000 students applied to become part of its pioneer batch. Interviews are still required now, although the number of candidates shortlisted for the six undergraduate degree courses has trebled. They are conducted individually or in groups, with professors on the lookout for intellectual curiosity and leadership qualities. SMU said a select group of students - about 1,000 - with strong academic and other abilities were invited to visit the university on "SMU Discovery Day" this year. Prof Kong said: "Our engagement is directed at confirming that they are indeed an excellent match for the education that SMU offers, and for them to confirm that SMU is the university of choice for them." A-level holder Benedict Lim, 20, who applied for the PLE course, said: "I have an interest in both (law and economics) and had a hard time picking one, so when I heard about SMU's new course, I jumped at the chance." He is keen on a broad-based education as he believes it will train him to be versatile and adaptable and enable him to switch careers. "You know what they say about students having to take on jobs that don't exist today. "I really do believe that. That's why it is best to have a broad-based education, so that you have a broad understanding of issues and how the world works."",12.996025800973168

2016,Singapore Management University|smu,St. Joseph's Institution|sji|computer|com|infosys|information systems|analytics,"Which university? Which course of study?Aim for a course that best suits you, rather than enrol in the most lucrative one Tan Eng Chye Prof Tan is deputy president (academic affairs) and provost at the National University of Singapore. PUBLISHED 6 HOURS AGOhttp://www.straitstimes.com/singapor...ourse-of-study The university admissions season is in full swing, and this is an exciting time for students in Singapore. The tertiary education landscape here has expanded significantly, and there are now many varied and interesting pathways for students to choose from, from traditional professional degree courses in medicine or engineering, to music and the liberal arts and science. Many parents I met at the National University of Singapore's (NUS) Open Day last month remarked that they are envious of the plethora of choices their children have, and wish to be young once more. Some of you may have secured multiple offers from different universities in Singapore and overseas, and you will have to make an acceptance decision soon. But how should one decide? Every year, the Ministry of Education publishes the employment rates and median starting salaries of fresh graduates of the different degree programmes offered by local universities. I certainly hope students do not make decisions based solely on data obtained through the Graduate Employment Survey (GES). GES data provides an indication of starting salaries. Starting salaries are but a guide; they neither set the course nor determine one's career trajectory or destiny. In this volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous or "Vuca" world, one cannot predict the future or where the lucrative jobs will be. You would therefore want your university education to equip you with broad-based life skills, and develop you with the flexibility and resilience needed to pick up new knowledge, adapt to new circumstances, and exploit job opportunities across a variety of sectors throughout your lifetime of careers. Another consideration is whether and how the university course adds value to your educational journey. Some students (and parents) may look to university rankings as a measure of the strength of a university department. And there are definitely synergies between research and education. If the university department excels in research, and counts world-leading researchers in the field, it is likely that cutting-edge research will filter through to your learning experience. You will have the opportunity to be taught by highly regarded academics, and there will be plenty of opportunities to conduct research under the who's-who in the field. This is particularly valuable if you have a very strong interest in research or academia. Choosing a university that excels in your area of interest may also open up more specialised opportunities, such as advanced facilities, academic opportunities such as overseas study or research trips, as well as internships and employment opportunities with prestigious organisations in the industry. Beyond academic reputation, your choice of university will also affect your life intellectually, socially and professionally. You should evaluate the entire student experience, and whether it will suit you. Find out if the social setting on campus is what you would want to be part of. NUS has, for example, the Yale-NUS College and the University Town Residential College programmes, which offer an integrated living and learning experience, amid a collegial and intellectually vibrant setting. Another distinctive programme is the NUS Overseas Colleges programme, where students get to live, work and study in an entrepreneurial hub such as Silicon Valley, New York City or Stockholm, taking entrepreneurship classes at a partner university while working in promising entrepreneurial start-ups. All universities have carefully developed their own suite of programmes and it is worth your time and effort to find out what is on offer. Talk to the professors, and to current students. Universities hold Open Days and various outreach sessions where you can visit the campus and get first-hand information. The best-ranked university or the programme that offers you two degrees in the shortest duration may sound attractive, but they may not necessarily be what you are looking for.  Some of you may want an intensely academic experience, and to pick up as many degrees in the shortest possible time. Yet others may prefer to develop a broader range of capabilities, to try out new things, or to pursue more varied experiences. You should aim to identify a university and a course that best suits you, and not simply enrol in the most competitive or lucrative course. After all, you will be spending your next three to four years in this programme. For those of you whose grades may not meet the degree programme's published entry requirements, do not give up. All local universities have discretionary admissions schemes. Last year, NUS interviewed a record 1,600 students under the scheme, and admitted 670 students. This scheme allows universities to assess applicants more holistically, and to consider their passions and attributes such as leadership, resilience or entrepreneurial skills or talent in non-academic areas. The good news is that from the next academic year onwards, NUS, Nanyang Technological University and Singapore Management University can take in more students under the Discretionary Admissions Scheme, from 10 per cent of the annual intake currently, to up to 15 per cent. This will enable more students to enter universities on the basis of their strengths and talents, beyond academic performance. There is no perfect university. What is key is to make a considered decision with the resources and information that are available to you. Your degree should help start you on the journey to where you want to go. The knowledge, experiences and opportunities in your university life should also prepare you for life beyond your degree. As a student in Singapore, you will have up to the beginning of June to decide on your offers from most of the local universities. Whatever you eventually decide on, make the most of your university experience because, for many, it will be the best time of your life.",14.829153173214898

Firstly, Congrats to all those who have successful applications. To those who are still waiting, or got rejected, don't feel despair, i'm pretty sure you'll find your way out. Like a professional juggler once told me, his biggest lesson in juggling isn't any particular technically-advanced sleights, but this: "When the ball drops, pick it up." Simple, but means a lot. Now, my story: I am from the '94 batch. Took my A levels in 2012, flunk it really badly, because I was heavily distracted by relationship issues (broke up with my ex, which caused a whole landslide trail of problems. But that's another whole long story, and besides the point). I barely studied during A levels then, and entered the exam hall hoping to fail. But miraculously, i scraped through it, and wasn't allowed to retain in JC. The resultant problem: Straight C result, with one S grade. Devastatingly embarrassing, and was a crushing defeat. You see, I come from an IP school, and that technically means that, should I flunk my A levels, all i'm equivalent of is a Primary 6 standard. So here I am, half of my life, effectively erased on papers. I gone on to enlist in NS, and kept my report card hidden away in the "shameful" corner of my room, collecting dust. After NS, i decided to take a break, took a gap year, all these while, casting aside any thoughts on studies and the education system. I went on to completing 1 internship, and 2 other jobs, as well as backpacking around Europe, South East Asia and Australia. It was fulfilling, and definitely a worthwhile experience. But now, 3 years after receiving my poor A levels result, I finally decided to get back on to the system, and apply for university. Expectedly, even with DA (I was a former national athlete, and I had my employers write in recommendation letters), I was sorrowfully rejected. This time, it hit me hard, after all these years of "escaping", I was finally facing the music, and there and then i knew I had to do sth with my life to move on.TL;DR: I still want to enter university. I know i can do better than that "shitty" result i've got. So here's what I came for, hoping for someone to offer me some advice. Personally, I am contemplating on retaking A levels. My previous subject combination was PMEE. I know my science practical grades could no longer be used, so i have to go to a private institution to do it. I am considering going to MDIS and follow its system. (Question, does anybody have any experience or knowledge or advice on MDIS? Is it a good choice for me?) On top of that, I am intending on going for private tuition to brush up my skills, because i've heard that MDIS tutors aren't the best, or at least they aren't as good as JC MOE teachers. (So, does anybody know of any good 1-to-1 tutors, that could give you undivided attention?) Lastly, is anybody here intending to repeat A levels, I was hoping to form a study group of a couple students, and mug together, and we could encourage one another. This is my one shot, i'm giving my all, and keeping my head in the game. Thank you for reading, hope to get some responses. Really sorry to learn of your predicament. Im in a same situation as u, also from ip. Registration for re taking a levels this year as private candidate has alrdy ended. Have u tried applying to private unis such as sim? Im still waiting for smu and sim to get back to me. If all else fails, maybe we can retake together! If thats the case, i might change my combi to science instead of arts haha",14.372325656409052
2016,Singapore Management University|smu,St. Joseph's Institution|sji|computer|com|infosys|information systems|analytics,"DISCLAIMER: I'd like to say that this post is not meant to flame anyone or put a negative spotlight on anyone. The examples I highlighted below are simply the comments/questions that I spotted which inspired me to write this. I wouldn't want to start a discussion about education in Singapore here, nor would this a debate for JC vs Poly. Just a little background about myself - I was a comms student in poly, did pretty average for my GPA (3.5x), missed the uni application in my first year of army, got rejected by NTU ADM last year, finally got a late acceptance letter from ADM this year. So trust me when I say I can empathise with those who are still waiting for their acceptance letter, and why some people are asking certain questions here.Spoiler!Hi guys, care to give your opinions and views on SMU Business VS NUS Statistics?  Which one will have higher demand by employers? The answer to this is simple, ask yourself where do you want to work? MNC? Local startup? The big 4? Starting your own business? Government sector? The 'value' of a degree is only given to by the people looking at it. Even then, there are those companies in each category that would defy the stereotypical hiring policy. So my advice to the poster who asked this question is to define who are your said 'employers' first. If you have no idea where you want to work or which sector of business you want to be in, it might serve you better to understand more about the course to see which specific programme/school/school culture might suit you better rather which degree appeals more to 'employers'. It's better to make an informed choice yourself.Spoiler!Actually, people do look at where you study. I got a couple of friends in HR. They told me that they would also look at the university, course, GPA/grades, modules taken, then any leadership roles regardless of how many years of relevant work experience a person has. Some say they tend to give more priority to old boys/girls, alum, that sort of thing. I'm not saying you're wrong here buddy, and in fact you're correct in saying this! But like I mentioned previously, it depends on where you're applying for work at, what is the company's hiring policy, what are they looking for etc. Comments like this might mislead some to think that this one degree/choice of school will make or break their future. What your friends experienced are the hiring policies of their particular companies they work at, but it's definitely not the same across various companies.There's no 'one size fits all' answer to certain questions. There is also no 'only one single path' to success. Some students don't realise it yet. This is the point that I'm driving at - Students should not be afraid to seek out multiple answers to a single question. There is always more than one way to solve a single question. Isn't that how it is for Math too? There may be one solution given in the answer book but it doesn't mean that that's the only one.If you do not get your university placing in the public schools this year, there are many other options! For poly students, you can take a gap year and work first, try again next year or the year after, like what I was planning to do myself should I not get my placing this year. Work experience ain't a bad idea too. For JC students, you can always take the A's again (like what some here are planning to do), to get a better grade for your dream course on the next application. I had a friend who couldn't get pharmaceutical, retook his A's while serving NS, scored a much better grade and went on to pharmaceutical on a scholarship in the end. If you really want to study this year, then private schools might be a viable idea as well. Yes things might not have gone according to plan for you. You might have been taught your whole life that you must get into NTU/NUS/SMU, or that might have been pressure on yourself. But fact is, if you're not getting in (even after appeal), then it's on you to take your next step forward. You have to keep moving forward in life despite the obstacles you face. If you're really rejected in the end, allow yourself to be sad for a little while, then pick yourself up, make plans, take the next step forward and move on. You might have to take a little detour, but it doesn't mean you can't get there. It's just how badly you want it. I hope this lengthy post written at 3am in the morning would encourage some of you even a little, because I know what it's like to constantly fail at every turn and have life keep pushing you down. If it did, then I'm glad. ",13.914498946647969

SMU received 1,108 applications for the 45 places in the course, which means about 25 students are vying for every place. The demand for the new course has also led to a rise in total number of applications - 14,000 in all this year, a 6 per cent rise over last year. Earlier this year, when SMU announced the new course, its officials likened it to Oxford University's prestigious politics, philosophy and economics course. It is aimed at giving students a broad understanding of how the world works and will prepare them for a range of careers. Students who had applied for the course said it is an unusual combination since it includes the study of law with economics and politics - and prestigious to boot as it is being offered to only a select group of high-calibre students. Many were also drawn by the fact that the course would prepare them for a wide range of jobs, including in journalism, foreign affairs, public service, consulting and research. SMU provost Lily Kong said she was delighted with the response. She added: "From all our engagement sessions, it is clear that students, parents and employers recognise the value that the PLE combination of disciplines can bring in preparing graduates who can handle multifaceted careers... "Through a deeper understanding of how politics, law and economics intersect to shape the world in which we live, we hope to groom a new generation of leaders and thinkers for Singapore." The 45 students selected for the course will take all three subjects in the first year, before specialising in one of four areas - global studies, distribution and justice, public policy and governance, or choice and behaviour - from year two. Students will also have to go on a 10-week internship during which they will work on a project to find solutions to a real-world problem. SMU said several firms have indicated their interest in offering internships to those on the course. They include the Economic Development Board as well as consultancies like Bain and Company. SMU officials said close to 5,000 of the 14,000 applicants have been shortlisted so far. They will be further assessed via interviews. Professor Kong said that, besides academic results, SMU uses other criteria for admission. "Exam grades are a valid measure, but they cannot be the sole measure of a student's ability." The university is the first in Singapore to require all [shortlisted] candidates to attend an interview. It started the practice 16 years ago, when 2,000 students applied to become part of its pioneer batch. Interviews are still required now, although the number of candidates shortlisted for the six undergraduate degree courses has trebled. They are conducted individually or in groups, with professors on the lookout for intellectual curiosity and leadership qualities. SMU said a select group of students - about 1,000 - with strong academic and other abilities were invited to visit the university on "SMU Discovery Day" this year. Prof Kong said: "Our engagement is directed at confirming that they are indeed an excellent match for the education that SMU offers, and for them to confirm that SMU is the university of choice for them." A-level holder Benedict Lim, 20, who applied for the PLE course, said: "I have an interest in both (law and economics) and had a hard time picking one, so when I heard about SMU's new course, I jumped at the chance." He is keen on a broad-based education as he believes it will train him to be versatile and adaptable and enable him to switch careers. "You know what they say about students having to take on jobs that don't exist today. "I really do believe that. That's why it is best to have a broad-based education, so that you have a broad understanding of issues and how the world works." Probably an inflated nunber What they shld publish rather is the number of ppl putting that as their first choice at smu",13.257581219483185
2016,Singapore Management University|smu,St. Joseph's Institution|sji|computer|com|infosys|information systems|analytics,"SINGAPORE: Three of Singapore's autonomous universities are refining the way they admit students under the Discretionary Admissions Scheme, which looks beyond a person's academic achievements. It comes as the universities prepare to take in more students under the scheme, when the current cap of 10 per cent allowed for discretionary admissions goes up to 15 per cent next year. ADVERTISING inRead invented by Teads National University of Singapore (NUS) is offering 7,000 places for the coming academic year, but it has received four times the number of applicants. While it has started handing out offers to those who made the cut based on their grades, about 1,800 students who did not are undergoing interviews to be considered for discretionary admissions this year. NUS has been evaluating and admitting more students under the scheme over the years. Last year, it evaluated 1,600 students, 400 more than 2014. 670 of them got in, 70 more than 2014. With more students expected to be considered for discretionary admissions, the process at NUS may be refined. Said Professor Tan Eng Chye, deputy president of academic affairs at NUS: “We are evolving; for instance, we have gotten alumni to help us with the interviews. I find that very useful because the alumni have a lot of experience in sizing up people and candidates, and they ask very useful questions. “We also provide more data on what to look out for and if the numbers get to be big, we may decide that maybe we can have sort of a test first - not an academic test per se, but perhaps a test to look at other non-academic aspects of that person. It could be an aptitude test.” Prof Tan added: “Exercising flexibility is one aspect; you also have to be fairly sharp on what to look for - it is not simply: 'OK, meet the numbers.' Our interest is to look for attributes of the applicants that would make the student community more interesting, more diversified, and enhance the interaction within the student community. “Those who can adequately and can eloquently convey their passions and interests - that would be advantageous. But we also have to look out for students who may not be able to communicate as well, but yet they have the potential for us to groom them to be able graduates.” At the Singapore Management University (SMU), discretionary admissions currently form about 5 to 8 per cent of the annual intake. With the higher cap of 15 per cent for such admissions next year, the university will have "more leeway" when assessing students. Professor Pang Yang Hoong, vice provost for undergraduate matters and student development at SMU, said: “For SMU, looking at students with other qualifications is not something terribly new because we always been holistic in the way we assess students and their suitability for admission. We will be more flexible. “(We look for) passion, the aptitude for the course for which we are admitting them into. It would also be ideal if students have demonstrated that they are successful to be in time management, that they also possess resilience and the ability to overcome difficult situations. This will help us to assess if that person has got the resilience and the determination to do well in the programme.” SMU is expecting more polytechnic graduates to apply through the discretionary route with the cap being raised to 15 per cent of the annual intake. Nanyang Technological University (NTU) will also "broaden the criteria", to give more people a shot at securing a place. It will favourably consider those who possess "enthusiasm and relevant work experience". Professor Kam Chan Hin, senior associate provost for undergraduate education at NTU, commented: “Normally, they will look at other achievements that they have - whether in sports, in arts … or even if they are very passionate about community service, leadership. So these are the things that we usually look for. “We are going to encourage all the schools to broaden the criteria, to allow more people who have a very strong passion, to be given the opportunity to be interviewed. We should be more adventurous, open it a bit more and ask more questions, outside of the usual parameters, and if you find somebody who is really very interesting and very passionate … give them a chance.” NTU had evaluated 1,400 students under the scheme last year and about 600 were given a place. All three universities said that even as they exercise flexibility, it is still important for students to show that they possess the "adequate academic competence" to go through the rigour and demands of a university education.  - CNA/ms",13.148333691613786

Why didn't you apply for Humanities & Social Studies instead? [Probing CCAs & Interests -2] 5. Why do you still want to choose NTU instead of NUS? [Universities Choice -3] Below are just my opinions. The interview ended surprisingly faster than expected - far less than 10 minutes. However, there were no questions related to assess my competency for ACBS, and I guess that these questions are completely the same as single degree interview. Also, I doubt they even know what I actually applied for. So for those who are applying ACBS as well, do rest assure.  Comparing NTU and SMU, I find that NTU is more rigid in the way they conduct their interviews. They seem to have a list of standardized questions to be asked. Whereas for SMU, after I spoken about my attachment in one of the Big 4, the whole conversation was all about the work I did, and how I was able to cope with stress in the environment. Very friendly professors. As such, it is much easier to control your conversation topic for SMU. Again, in my opinion, NTU is more interested in how you can contribute to NTU. Whilst for SMU, the professors really want to know you as an individual. Also, the interviewers in NTU seem to be expressionless; it feels that I was talking to robots, but at the very least they did hold eye contact with me. Both are equally efficient in conducting their interviews nevertheless. Generally agree with Aomatsu.  Just to add on, I went for the ACBS interview back in 2014, because, you know, NS, and the main interviewer was Prof Valerie. We had a rather entertaining conversation and it was more of a chit-chat session than an interview. NTU knows what courses you applied for. She had my application form in hard copy on the table (in full view) and asked me why I applied for REP as my 2nd choice, and only put Accountancy (single degree) as the 3rd choice. Other than that, the main focus was definitely on how I would contribute NTU if they offered me a place/scholarship. Of course I talked about joining some clubs in NBS, my career goals and the various competitions/events at NTU which interest me. They didn't ask me those "essay" kind of questions though, but we chatted for around 20 minutes. It was a very light-hearted and enjoyable session and it felt really short in fact. After the interview, the prof invited me to apply for the USP. I also went for the SMU interview (also in 2014) for the double degree programme in Accountancy and Business. I remember being interviewed by Prof Seow and Prof Gary Pan. They seemed really concerned about whether I applied to NUS/NTU and asked me which I would pick if I was offered all 3. It somehow gave me the impression that they were being insecure/desperate. However, I liked the fact that they gave more attention to my hobbies and interests and focused less on academic achievements. I guess this is one example of SMU's holistic admissions process. They were also constantly marketing their school throughout the interview by asking me if I knew that their school of accountancy was ranked xxx in the BYU rankings etc, and kept comparing them to the other 2 unis. What I got out of that interview was that the profs at SMU are really passionate about what they do and that they're incredibly driven especially when it comes to building the school's reputation.  At the end of the day, both are local universities. Employers will lump NUS/NTU/SMU together anyway. So in terms of employability, no difference really. Choose the school which suits your personality better.",13.142454713816718

Which course of study?Aim for a course that best suits you, rather than enrol in the most lucrative one Tan Eng Chye Prof Tan is deputy president (academic affairs) and provost at the National University of Singapore. PUBLISHED 6 HOURS AGOhttp://www.straitstimes.com/singapor...ourse-of-study The university admissions season is in full swing, and this is an exciting time for students in Singapore. The tertiary education landscape here has expanded significantly, and there are now many varied and interesting pathways for students to choose from, from traditional professional degree courses in medicine or engineering, to music and the liberal arts and science. Many parents I met at the National University of Singapore's (NUS) Open Day last month remarked that they are envious of the plethora of choices their children have, and wish to be young once more. Some of you may have secured multiple offers from different universities in Singapore and overseas, and you will have to make an acceptance decision soon. But how should one decide? Every year, the Ministry of Education publishes the employment rates and median starting salaries of fresh graduates of the different degree programmes offered by local universities. I certainly hope students do not make decisions based solely on data obtained through the Graduate Employment Survey (GES). GES data provides an indication of starting salaries. Starting salaries are but a guide; they neither set the course nor determine one's career trajectory or destiny. In this volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous or "Vuca" world, one cannot predict the future or where the lucrative jobs will be. You would therefore want your university education to equip you with broad-based life skills, and develop you with the flexibility and resilience needed to pick up new knowledge, adapt to new circumstances, and exploit job opportunities across a variety of sectors throughout your lifetime of careers. Another consideration is whether and how the university course adds value to your educational journey. Some students (and parents) may look to university rankings as a measure of the strength of a university department. And there are definitely synergies between research and education. If the university department excels in research, and counts world-leading researchers in the field, it is likely that cutting-edge research will filter through to your learning experience. You will have the opportunity to be taught by highly regarded academics, and there will be plenty of opportunities to conduct research under the who's-who in the field. This is particularly valuable if you have a very strong interest in research or academia. Choosing a university that excels in your area of interest may also open up more specialised opportunities, such as advanced facilities, academic opportunities such as overseas study or research trips, as well as internships and employment opportunities with prestigious organisations in the industry. Beyond academic reputation, your choice of university will also affect your life intellectually, socially and professionally. You should evaluate the entire student experience, and whether it will suit you. Find out if the social setting on campus is what you would want to be part of. NUS has, for example, the Yale-NUS College and the University Town Residential College programmes, which offer an integrated living and learning experience, amid a collegial and intellectually vibrant setting. Another distinctive programme is the NUS Overseas Colleges programme, where students get to live, work and study in an entrepreneurial hub such as Silicon Valley, New York City or Stockholm, taking entrepreneurship classes at a partner university while working in promising entrepreneurial start-ups. All universities have carefully developed their own suite of programmes and it is worth your time and effort to find out what is on offer. Talk to the professors, and to current students. Universities hold Open Days and various outreach sessions where you can visit the campus and get first-hand information. The best-ranked university or the programme that offers you two degrees in the shortest duration may sound attractive, but they may not necessarily be what you are looking for.  Some of you may want an intensely academic experience, and to pick up as many degrees in the shortest possible time. Yet others may prefer to develop a broader range of capabilities, to try out new things, or to pursue more varied experiences. You should aim to identify a university and a course that best suits you, and not simply enrol in the most competitive or lucrative course. After all, you will be spending your next three to four years in this programme. For those of you whose grades may not meet the degree programme's published entry requirements, do not give up. All local universities have discretionary admissions schemes. Last year, NUS interviewed a record 1,600 students under the scheme, and admitted 670 students. This scheme allows universities to assess applicants more holistically, and to consider their passions and attributes such as leadership, resilience or entrepreneurial skills or talent in non-academic areas. The good news is that from the next academic year onwards, NUS, Nanyang Technological University and Singapore Management University can take in more students under the Discretionary Admissions Scheme, from 10 per cent of the annual intake currently, to up to 15 per cent. This will enable more students to enter universities on the basis of their strengths and talents, beyond academic performance. There is no perfect university. What is key is to make a considered decision with the resources and information that are available to you. Your degree should help start you on the journey to where you want to go. The knowledge, experiences and opportunities in your university life should also prepare you for life beyond your degree. As a student in Singapore, you will have up to the beginning of June to decide on your offers from most of the local universities. Whatever you eventually decide on, make the most of your university experience because, for many, it will be the best time of your life.",14.829153173214898

I was hoping to get some advice from you guys here. Firstly, Congrats to all those who have successful applications. To those who are still waiting, or got rejected, don't feel despair, i'm pretty sure you'll find your way out. Like a professional juggler once told me, his biggest lesson in juggling isn't any particular technically-advanced sleights, but this: "When the ball drops, pick it up." Simple, but means a lot. Now, my story: I am from the '94 batch. Took my A levels in 2012, flunk it really badly, because I was heavily distracted by relationship issues (broke up with my ex, which caused a whole landslide trail of problems. But that's another whole long story, and besides the point). I barely studied during A levels then, and entered the exam hall hoping to fail. But miraculously, i scraped through it, and wasn't allowed to retain in JC. The resultant problem: Straight C result, with one S grade. Devastatingly embarrassing, and was a crushing defeat. You see, I come from an IP school, and that technically means that, should I flunk my A levels, all i'm equivalent of is a Primary 6 standard. So here I am, half of my life, effectively erased on papers. I gone on to enlist in NS, and kept my report card hidden away in the "shameful" corner of my room, collecting dust. After NS, i decided to take a break, took a gap year, all these while, casting aside any thoughts on studies and the education system. I went on to completing 1 internship, and 2 other jobs, as well as backpacking around Europe, South East Asia and Australia. It was fulfilling, and definitely a worthwhile experience. But now, 3 years after receiving my poor A levels result, I finally decided to get back on to the system, and apply for university. Expectedly, even with DA (I was a former national athlete, and I had my employers write in recommendation letters), I was sorrowfully rejected. This time, it hit me hard, after all these years of "escaping", I was finally facing the music, and there and then i knew I had to do sth with my life to move on.TL;DR: I still want to enter university. I know i can do better than that "shitty" result i've got. So here's what I came for, hoping for someone to offer me some advice. Personally, I am contemplating on retaking A levels. My previous subject combination was PMEE. I know my science practical grades could no longer be used, so i have to go to a private institution to do it. I am considering going to MDIS and follow its system. (Question, does anybody have any experience or knowledge or advice on MDIS? Is it a good choice for me?) On top of that, I am intending on going for private tuition to brush up my skills, because i've heard that MDIS tutors aren't the best, or at least they aren't as good as JC MOE teachers. (So, does anybody know of any good 1-to-1 tutors, that could give you undivided attention?) Lastly, is anybody here intending to repeat A levels, I was hoping to form a study group of a couple students, and mug together, and we could encourage one another. This is my one shot, i'm giving my all, and keeping my head in the game. Thank you for reading, hope to get some responses. Really sorry to learn of your predicament. Im in a same situation as u, also from ip. Registration for re taking a levels this year as private candidate has alrdy ended. Have u tried applying to private unis such as sim? Im still waiting for smu and sim to get back to me. If all else fails, maybe we can retake together! If thats the case, i might change my combi to science instead of arts haha",14.372325656409052
2016,Singapore Management University|smu,Tampines Junior College|Tampines Meridian Junior College|Meridian Junior College|Tampines Meridian jc|Tampines jc|Meridian jc|mjc|tpjc|tmjc|computer|com|infosys|information systems|analytics,"DISCLAIMER: I'd like to say that this post is not meant to flame anyone or put a negative spotlight on anyone. The examples I highlighted below are simply the comments/questions that I spotted which inspired me to write this. I wouldn't want to start a discussion about education in Singapore here, nor would this a debate for JC vs Poly. Just a little background about myself - I was a comms student in poly, did pretty average for my GPA (3.5x), missed the uni application in my first year of army, got rejected by NTU ADM last year, finally got a late acceptance letter from ADM this year. So trust me when I say I can empathise with those who are still waiting for their acceptance letter, and why some people are asking certain questions here.Spoiler!Hi guys, care to give your opinions and views on SMU Business VS NUS Statistics?  Which one will have higher demand by employers? The answer to this is simple, ask yourself where do you want to work? MNC? Local startup? The big 4? Starting your own business? Government sector? The 'value' of a degree is only given to by the people looking at it. Even then, there are those companies in each category that would defy the stereotypical hiring policy. So my advice to the poster who asked this question is to define who are your said 'employers' first. If you have no idea where you want to work or which sector of business you want to be in, it might serve you better to understand more about the course to see which specific programme/school/school culture might suit you better rather which degree appeals more to 'employers'. It's better to make an informed choice yourself.Spoiler!Actually, people do look at where you study. I got a couple of friends in HR. They told me that they would also look at the university, course, GPA/grades, modules taken, then any leadership roles regardless of how many years of relevant work experience a person has. Some say they tend to give more priority to old boys/girls, alum, that sort of thing. I'm not saying you're wrong here buddy, and in fact you're correct in saying this! But like I mentioned previously, it depends on where you're applying for work at, what is the company's hiring policy, what are they looking for etc. Comments like this might mislead some to think that this one degree/choice of school will make or break their future. What your friends experienced are the hiring policies of their particular companies they work at, but it's definitely not the same across various companies.There's no 'one size fits all' answer to certain questions. There is also no 'only one single path' to success. Some students don't realise it yet. This is the point that I'm driving at - Students should not be afraid to seek out multiple answers to a single question. There is always more than one way to solve a single question. Isn't that how it is for Math too? There may be one solution given in the answer book but it doesn't mean that that's the only one.If you do not get your university placing in the public schools this year, there are many other options! For poly students, you can take a gap year and work first, try again next year or the year after, like what I was planning to do myself should I not get my placing this year. Work experience ain't a bad idea too. For JC students, you can always take the A's again (like what some here are planning to do), to get a better grade for your dream course on the next application. I had a friend who couldn't get pharmaceutical, retook his A's while serving NS, scored a much better grade and went on to pharmaceutical on a scholarship in the end. If you really want to study this year, then private schools might be a viable idea as well. Yes things might not have gone according to plan for you. You might have been taught your whole life that you must get into NTU/NUS/SMU, or that might have been pressure on yourself. But fact is, if you're not getting in (even after appeal), then it's on you to take your next step forward. You have to keep moving forward in life despite the obstacles you face. If you're really rejected in the end, allow yourself to be sad for a little while, then pick yourself up, make plans, take the next step forward and move on. You might have to take a little detour, but it doesn't mean you can't get there. It's just how badly you want it. I hope this lengthy post written at 3am in the morning would encourage some of you even a little, because I know what it's like to constantly fail at every turn and have life keep pushing you down. If it did, then I'm glad. ",13.914498946647969

SMU received 1,108 applications for the 45 places in the course, which means about 25 students are vying for every place. The demand for the new course has also led to a rise in total number of applications - 14,000 in all this year, a 6 per cent rise over last year. Earlier this year, when SMU announced the new course, its officials likened it to Oxford University's prestigious politics, philosophy and economics course. It is aimed at giving students a broad understanding of how the world works and will prepare them for a range of careers. Students who had applied for the course said it is an unusual combination since it includes the study of law with economics and politics - and prestigious to boot as it is being offered to only a select group of high-calibre students. Many were also drawn by the fact that the course would prepare them for a wide range of jobs, including in journalism, foreign affairs, public service, consulting and research. SMU provost Lily Kong said she was delighted with the response. She added: "From all our engagement sessions, it is clear that students, parents and employers recognise the value that the PLE combination of disciplines can bring in preparing graduates who can handle multifaceted careers... "Through a deeper understanding of how politics, law and economics intersect to shape the world in which we live, we hope to groom a new generation of leaders and thinkers for Singapore." The 45 students selected for the course will take all three subjects in the first year, before specialising in one of four areas - global studies, distribution and justice, public policy and governance, or choice and behaviour - from year two. Students will also have to go on a 10-week internship during which they will work on a project to find solutions to a real-world problem. SMU said several firms have indicated their interest in offering internships to those on the course. They include the Economic Development Board as well as consultancies like Bain and Company. SMU officials said close to 5,000 of the 14,000 applicants have been shortlisted so far. They will be further assessed via interviews. Professor Kong said that, besides academic results, SMU uses other criteria for admission. "Exam grades are a valid measure, but they cannot be the sole measure of a student's ability." The university is the first in Singapore to require all [shortlisted] candidates to attend an interview. It started the practice 16 years ago, when 2,000 students applied to become part of its pioneer batch. Interviews are still required now, although the number of candidates shortlisted for the six undergraduate degree courses has trebled. They are conducted individually or in groups, with professors on the lookout for intellectual curiosity and leadership qualities. SMU said a select group of students - about 1,000 - with strong academic and other abilities were invited to visit the university on "SMU Discovery Day" this year. Prof Kong said: "Our engagement is directed at confirming that they are indeed an excellent match for the education that SMU offers, and for them to confirm that SMU is the university of choice for them." A-level holder Benedict Lim, 20, who applied for the PLE course, said: "I have an interest in both (law and economics) and had a hard time picking one, so when I heard about SMU's new course, I jumped at the chance." He is keen on a broad-based education as he believes it will train him to be versatile and adaptable and enable him to switch careers. "You know what they say about students having to take on jobs that don't exist today. "I really do believe that. That's why it is best to have a broad-based education, so that you have a broad understanding of issues and how the world works."

2016,Singapore Management University|smu,Tampines Junior College|Tampines Meridian Junior College|Meridian Junior College|Tampines Meridian jc|Tampines jc|Meridian jc|mjc|tpjc|tmjc|computer|com|infosys|information systems|analytics,"SINGAPORE: Three of Singapore's autonomous universities are refining the way they admit students under the Discretionary Admissions Scheme, which looks beyond a person's academic achievements. It comes as the universities prepare to take in more students under the scheme, when the current cap of 10 per cent allowed for discretionary admissions goes up to 15 per cent next year. ADVERTISING inRead invented by Teads National University of Singapore (NUS) is offering 7,000 places for the coming academic year, but it has received four times the number of applicants. While it has started handing out offers to those who made the cut based on their grades, about 1,800 students who did not are undergoing interviews to be considered for discretionary admissions this year. NUS has been evaluating and admitting more students under the scheme over the years. Last year, it evaluated 1,600 students, 400 more than 2014. 670 of them got in, 70 more than 2014. With more students expected to be considered for discretionary admissions, the process at NUS may be refined. Said Professor Tan Eng Chye, deputy president of academic affairs at NUS: “We are evolving; for instance, we have gotten alumni to help us with the interviews. I find that very useful because the alumni have a lot of experience in sizing up people and candidates, and they ask very useful questions. “We also provide more data on what to look out for and if the numbers get to be big, we may decide that maybe we can have sort of a test first - not an academic test per se, but perhaps a test to look at other non-academic aspects of that person. It could be an aptitude test.” Prof Tan added: “Exercising flexibility is one aspect; you also have to be fairly sharp on what to look for - it is not simply: 'OK, meet the numbers.' Our interest is to look for attributes of the applicants that would make the student community more interesting, more diversified, and enhance the interaction within the student community. “Those who can adequately and can eloquently convey their passions and interests - that would be advantageous. But we also have to look out for students who may not be able to communicate as well, but yet they have the potential for us to groom them to be able graduates.” At the Singapore Management University (SMU), discretionary admissions currently form about 5 to 8 per cent of the annual intake. With the higher cap of 15 per cent for such admissions next year, the university will have "more leeway" when assessing students. Professor Pang Yang Hoong, vice provost for undergraduate matters and student development at SMU, said: “For SMU, looking at students with other qualifications is not something terribly new because we always been holistic in the way we assess students and their suitability for admission. We will be more flexible. “(We look for) passion, the aptitude for the course for which we are admitting them into. It would also be ideal if students have demonstrated that they are successful to be in time management, that they also possess resilience and the ability to overcome difficult situations. This will help us to assess if that person has got the resilience and the determination to do well in the programme.” SMU is expecting more polytechnic graduates to apply through the discretionary route with the cap being raised to 15 per cent of the annual intake. Nanyang Technological University (NTU) will also "broaden the criteria", to give more people a shot at securing a place. It will favourably consider those who possess "enthusiasm and relevant work experience". Professor Kam Chan Hin, senior associate provost for undergraduate education at NTU, commented: “Normally, they will look at other achievements that they have - whether in sports, in arts … or even if they are very passionate about community service, leadership. So these are the things that we usually look for. “We are going to encourage all the schools to broaden the criteria, to allow more people who have a very strong passion, to be given the opportunity to be interviewed. We should be more adventurous, open it a bit more and ask more questions, outside of the usual parameters, and if you find somebody who is really very interesting and very passionate … give them a chance.” NTU had evaluated 1,400 students under the scheme last year and about 600 were given a place. All three universities said that even as they exercise flexibility, it is still important for students to show that they possess the "adequate academic competence" to go through the rigour and demands of a university education.  - CNA/ms",13.148333691613786

Describe yourself. 2. Why do you think we should accept you? How can you contribute to NTU? 3. Did you apply in other Universities as well?Probing Questions 1. Describe yourself in 2 sentences.

Why didn't you apply for Humanities & Social Studies instead? [Probing CCAs & Interests -2] 5. Why do you still want to choose NTU instead of NUS? [Universities Choice -3] Below are just my opinions. The interview ended surprisingly faster than expected - far less than 10 minutes. However, there were no questions related to assess my competency for ACBS, and I guess that these questions are completely the same as single degree interview. Also, I doubt they even know what I actually applied for. So for those who are applying ACBS as well, do rest assure.  Comparing NTU and SMU, I find that NTU is more rigid in the way they conduct their interviews. They seem to have a list of standardized questions to be asked. Whereas for SMU, after I spoken about my attachment in one of the Big 4, the whole conversation was all about the work I did, and how I was able to cope with stress in the environment. Very friendly professors. As such, it is much easier to control your conversation topic for SMU. Again, in my opinion, NTU is more interested in how you can contribute to NTU. Whilst for SMU, the professors really want to know you as an individual. Also, the interviewers in NTU seem to be expressionless; it feels that I was talking to robots, but at the very least they did hold eye contact with me. Both are equally efficient in conducting their interviews nevertheless. Generally agree with Aomatsu.  Just to add on, I went for the ACBS interview back in 2014, because, you know, NS, and the main interviewer was Prof Valerie. We had a rather entertaining conversation and it was more of a chit-chat session than an interview. NTU knows what courses you applied for. She had my application form in hard copy on the table (in full view) and asked me why I applied for REP as my 2nd choice, and only put Accountancy (single degree) as the 3rd choice. Other than that, the main focus was definitely on how I would contribute NTU if they offered me a place/scholarship. Of course I talked about joining some clubs in NBS, my career goals and the various competitions/events at NTU which interest me. They didn't ask me those "essay" kind of questions though, but we chatted for around 20 minutes. It was a very light-hearted and enjoyable session and it felt really short in fact. After the interview, the prof invited me to apply for the USP. I also went for the SMU interview (also in 2014) for the double degree programme in Accountancy and Business. I remember being interviewed by Prof Seow and Prof Gary Pan. They seemed really concerned about whether I applied to NUS/NTU and asked me which I would pick if I was offered all 3. It somehow gave me the impression that they were being insecure/desperate. However, I liked the fact that they gave more attention to my hobbies and interests and focused less on academic achievements. I guess this is one example of SMU's holistic admissions process. They were also constantly marketing their school throughout the interview by asking me if I knew that their school of accountancy was ranked xxx in the BYU rankings etc, and kept comparing them to the other 2 unis. What I got out of that interview was that the profs at SMU are really passionate about what they do and that they're incredibly driven especially when it comes to building the school's reputation.  At the end of the day, both are local universities. Employers will lump NUS/NTU/SMU together anyway. So in terms of employability, no difference really. Choose the school which suits your personality better.",13.142454713816718

Eat whole fruits after lunch to regulate your blood sugar so you won't feel that sleepy. I ate papaya, banana or dragonfruits etc... 3. If you are a coffee jittery person, do not drink highly caffeinated beverages, such as myself  4.

2016,Singapore Management University|smu,Temasek Junior College|temasek jc|tjc|computer|com|infosys|information systems|analytics,"Which university? Which course of study?Aim for a course that best suits you, rather than enrol in the most lucrative one Tan Eng Chye Prof Tan is deputy president (academic affairs) and provost at the National University of Singapore. PUBLISHED 6 HOURS AGOhttp://www.straitstimes.com/singapor...ourse-of-study The university admissions season is in full swing, and this is an exciting time for students in Singapore. The tertiary education landscape here has expanded significantly, and there are now many varied and interesting pathways for students to choose from, from traditional professional degree courses in medicine or engineering, to music and the liberal arts and science. Many parents I met at the National University of Singapore's (NUS) Open Day last month remarked that they are envious of the plethora of choices their children have, and wish to be young once more. Some of you may have secured multiple offers from different universities in Singapore and overseas, and you will have to make an acceptance decision soon. But how should one decide? Every year, the Ministry of Education publishes the employment rates and median starting salaries of fresh graduates of the different degree programmes offered by local universities. I certainly hope students do not make decisions based solely on data obtained through the Graduate Employment Survey (GES). GES data provides an indication of starting salaries. Starting salaries are but a guide; they neither set the course nor determine one's career trajectory or destiny. In this volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous or "Vuca" world, one cannot predict the future or where the lucrative jobs will be. You would therefore want your university education to equip you with broad-based life skills, and develop you with the flexibility and resilience needed to pick up new knowledge, adapt to new circumstances, and exploit job opportunities across a variety of sectors throughout your lifetime of careers. Another consideration is whether and how the university course adds value to your educational journey. Some students (and parents) may look to university rankings as a measure of the strength of a university department. And there are definitely synergies between research and education. If the university department excels in research, and counts world-leading researchers in the field, it is likely that cutting-edge research will filter through to your learning experience. You will have the opportunity to be taught by highly regarded academics, and there will be plenty of opportunities to conduct research under the who's-who in the field. This is particularly valuable if you have a very strong interest in research or academia. Choosing a university that excels in your area of interest may also open up more specialised opportunities, such as advanced facilities, academic opportunities such as overseas study or research trips, as well as internships and employment opportunities with prestigious organisations in the industry. Beyond academic reputation, your choice of university will also affect your life intellectually, socially and professionally. You should evaluate the entire student experience, and whether it will suit you. Find out if the social setting on campus is what you would want to be part of. NUS has, for example, the Yale-NUS College and the University Town Residential College programmes, which offer an integrated living and learning experience, amid a collegial and intellectually vibrant setting. Another distinctive programme is the NUS Overseas Colleges programme, where students get to live, work and study in an entrepreneurial hub such as Silicon Valley, New York City or Stockholm, taking entrepreneurship classes at a partner university while working in promising entrepreneurial start-ups. All universities have carefully developed their own suite of programmes and it is worth your time and effort to find out what is on offer. Talk to the professors, and to current students. Universities hold Open Days and various outreach sessions where you can visit the campus and get first-hand information. The best-ranked university or the programme that offers you two degrees in the shortest duration may sound attractive, but they may not necessarily be what you are looking for.  Some of you may want an intensely academic experience, and to pick up as many degrees in the shortest possible time. Yet others may prefer to develop a broader range of capabilities, to try out new things, or to pursue more varied experiences. You should aim to identify a university and a course that best suits you, and not simply enrol in the most competitive or lucrative course. After all, you will be spending your next three to four years in this programme. For those of you whose grades may not meet the degree programme's published entry requirements, do not give up. All local universities have discretionary admissions schemes. Last year, NUS interviewed a record 1,600 students under the scheme, and admitted 670 students. This scheme allows universities to assess applicants more holistically, and to consider their passions and attributes such as leadership, resilience or entrepreneurial skills or talent in non-academic areas. The good news is that from the next academic year onwards, NUS, Nanyang Technological University and Singapore Management University can take in more students under the Discretionary Admissions Scheme, from 10 per cent of the annual intake currently, to up to 15 per cent. This will enable more students to enter universities on the basis of their strengths and talents, beyond academic performance. There is no perfect university. What is key is to make a considered decision with the resources and information that are available to you. Your degree should help start you on the journey to where you want to go. The knowledge, experiences and opportunities in your university life should also prepare you for life beyond your degree. As a student in Singapore, you will have up to the beginning of June to decide on your offers from most of the local universities. Whatever you eventually decide on, make the most of your university experience because, for many, it will be the best time of your life.",14.829153173214898

I was hoping to get some advice from you guys here. Firstly, Congrats to all those who have successful applications. To those who are still waiting, or got rejected, don't feel despair, i'm pretty sure you'll find your way out. Like a professional juggler once told me, his biggest lesson in juggling isn't any particular technically-advanced sleights, but this: "When the ball drops, pick it up." Simple, but means a lot. Now, my story: I am from the '94 batch. Took my A levels in 2012, flunk it really badly, because I was heavily distracted by relationship issues (broke up with my ex, which caused a whole landslide trail of problems. But that's another whole long story, and besides the point). I barely studied during A levels then, and entered the exam hall hoping to fail. But miraculously, i scraped through it, and wasn't allowed to retain in JC. The resultant problem: Straight C result, with one S grade. Devastatingly embarrassing, and was a crushing defeat. You see, I come from an IP school, and that technically means that, should I flunk my A levels, all i'm equivalent of is a Primary 6 standard. So here I am, half of my life, effectively erased on papers. I gone on to enlist in NS, and kept my report card hidden away in the "shameful" corner of my room, collecting dust. After NS, i decided to take a break, took a gap year, all these while, casting aside any thoughts on studies and the education system. I went on to completing 1 internship, and 2 other jobs, as well as backpacking around Europe, South East Asia and Australia. It was fulfilling, and definitely a worthwhile experience. But now, 3 years after receiving my poor A levels result, I finally decided to get back on to the system, and apply for university. Expectedly, even with DA (I was a former national athlete, and I had my employers write in recommendation letters), I was sorrowfully rejected. This time, it hit me hard, after all these years of "escaping", I was finally facing the music, and there and then i knew I had to do sth with my life to move on.TL;DR: I still want to enter university. I know i can do better than that "shitty" result i've got. So here's what I came for, hoping for someone to offer me some advice. Personally, I am contemplating on retaking A levels. My previous subject combination was PMEE. I know my science practical grades could no longer be used, so i have to go to a private institution to do it. I am considering going to MDIS and follow its system. (Question, does anybody have any experience or knowledge or advice on MDIS? Is it a good choice for me?) On top of that, I am intending on going for private tuition to brush up my skills, because i've heard that MDIS tutors aren't the best, or at least they aren't as good as JC MOE teachers. (So, does anybody know of any good 1-to-1 tutors, that could give you undivided attention?) Lastly, is anybody here intending to repeat A levels, I was hoping to form a study group of a couple students, and mug together, and we could encourage one another. This is my one shot, i'm giving my all, and keeping my head in the game. Thank you for reading, hope to get some responses. Really sorry to learn of your predicament. Im in a same situation as u, also from ip. Registration for re taking a levels this year as private candidate has alrdy ended. Have u tried applying to private unis such as sim? Im still waiting for smu and sim to get back to me. If all else fails, maybe we can retake together! If thats the case, i might change my combi to science instead of arts haha",14.372325656409052
2016,Singapore Management University|smu,Temasek Junior College|temasek jc|tjc|computer|com|infosys|information systems|analytics,"DISCLAIMER: I'd like to say that this post is not meant to flame anyone or put a negative spotlight on anyone. The examples I highlighted below are simply the comments/questions that I spotted which inspired me to write this. I wouldn't want to start a discussion about education in Singapore here, nor would this a debate for JC vs Poly. Just a little background about myself - I was a comms student in poly, did pretty average for my GPA (3.5x), missed the uni application in my first year of army, got rejected by NTU ADM last year, finally got a late acceptance letter from ADM this year. So trust me when I say I can empathise with those who are still waiting for their acceptance letter, and why some people are asking certain questions here.Spoiler!Hi guys, care to give your opinions and views on SMU Business VS NUS Statistics?  Which one will have higher demand by employers? The answer to this is simple, ask yourself where do you want to work? MNC? Local startup? The big 4? Starting your own business? Government sector? The 'value' of a degree is only given to by the people looking at it. Even then, there are those companies in each category that would defy the stereotypical hiring policy. So my advice to the poster who asked this question is to define who are your said 'employers' first. If you have no idea where you want to work or which sector of business you want to be in, it might serve you better to understand more about the course to see which specific programme/school/school culture might suit you better rather which degree appeals more to 'employers'. It's better to make an informed choice yourself.Spoiler!Actually, people do look at where you study. I got a couple of friends in HR. They told me that they would also look at the university, course, GPA/grades, modules taken, then any leadership roles regardless of how many years of relevant work experience a person has. Some say they tend to give more priority to old boys/girls, alum, that sort of thing. I'm not saying you're wrong here buddy, and in fact you're correct in saying this! But like I mentioned previously, it depends on where you're applying for work at, what is the company's hiring policy, what are they looking for etc. Comments like this might mislead some to think that this one degree/choice of school will make or break their future. What your friends experienced are the hiring policies of their particular companies they work at, but it's definitely not the same across various companies.There's no 'one size fits all' answer to certain questions. There is also no 'only one single path' to success. Some students don't realise it yet. This is the point that I'm driving at - Students should not be afraid to seek out multiple answers to a single question. There is always more than one way to solve a single question. Isn't that how it is for Math too? There may be one solution given in the answer book but it doesn't mean that that's the only one.If you do not get your university placing in the public schools this year, there are many other options! For poly students, you can take a gap year and work first, try again next year or the year after, like what I was planning to do myself should I not get my placing this year. Work experience ain't a bad idea too. For JC students, you can always take the A's again (like what some here are planning to do), to get a better grade for your dream course on the next application. I had a friend who couldn't get pharmaceutical, retook his A's while serving NS, scored a much better grade and went on to pharmaceutical on a scholarship in the end. If you really want to study this year, then private schools might be a viable idea as well. Yes things might not have gone according to plan for you. You might have been taught your whole life that you must get into NTU/NUS/SMU, or that might have been pressure on yourself. But fact is, if you're not getting in (even after appeal), then it's on you to take your next step forward. You have to keep moving forward in life despite the obstacles you face. If you're really rejected in the end, allow yourself to be sad for a little while, then pick yourself up, make plans, take the next step forward and move on. You might have to take a little detour, but it doesn't mean you can't get there. It's just how badly you want it. I hope this lengthy post written at 3am in the morning would encourage some of you even a little, because I know what it's like to constantly fail at every turn and have life keep pushing you down. If it did, then I'm glad. ",13.914498946647969

SMU received 1,108 applications for the 45 places in the course, which means about 25 students are vying for every place. The demand for the new course has also led to a rise in total number of applications - 14,000 in all this year, a 6 per cent rise over last year. Earlier this year, when SMU announced the new course, its officials likened it to Oxford University's prestigious politics, philosophy and economics course. It is aimed at giving students a broad understanding of how the world works and will prepare them for a range of careers. Students who had applied for the course said it is an unusual combination since it includes the study of law with economics and politics - and prestigious to boot as it is being offered to only a select group of high-calibre students. Many were also drawn by the fact that the course would prepare them for a wide range of jobs, including in journalism, foreign affairs, public service, consulting and research. SMU provost Lily Kong said she was delighted with the response. She added: "From all our engagement sessions, it is clear that students, parents and employers recognise the value that the PLE combination of disciplines can bring in preparing graduates who can handle multifaceted careers... "Through a deeper understanding of how politics, law and economics intersect to shape the world in which we live, we hope to groom a new generation of leaders and thinkers for Singapore." The 45 students selected for the course will take all three subjects in the first year, before specialising in one of four areas - global studies, distribution and justice, public policy and governance, or choice and behaviour - from year two. Students will also have to go on a 10-week internship during which they will work on a project to find solutions to a real-world problem. SMU said several firms have indicated their interest in offering internships to those on the course. They include the Economic Development Board as well as consultancies like Bain and Company. SMU officials said close to 5,000 of the 14,000 applicants have been shortlisted so far. They will be further assessed via interviews. Professor Kong said that, besides academic results, SMU uses other criteria for admission. "Exam grades are a valid measure, but they cannot be the sole measure of a student's ability." The university is the first in Singapore to require all [shortlisted] candidates to attend an interview. It started the practice 16 years ago, when 2,000 students applied to become part of its pioneer batch. Interviews are still required now, although the number of candidates shortlisted for the six undergraduate degree courses has trebled. They are conducted individually or in groups, with professors on the lookout for intellectual curiosity and leadership qualities. SMU said a select group of students - about 1,000 - with strong academic and other abilities were invited to visit the university on "SMU Discovery Day" this year. Prof Kong said: "Our engagement is directed at confirming that they are indeed an excellent match for the education that SMU offers, and for them to confirm that SMU is the university of choice for them." A-level holder Benedict Lim, 20, who applied for the PLE course, said: "I have an interest in both (law and economics) and had a hard time picking one, so when I heard about SMU's new course, I jumped at the chance." He is keen on a broad-based education as he believes it will train him to be versatile and adaptable and enable him to switch careers. "You know what they say about students having to take on jobs that don't exist today. "I really do believe that. That's why it is best to have a broad-based education, so that you have a broad understanding of issues and how the world works."

2016,Singapore Management University|smu,Temasek Junior College|temasek jc|tjc|computer|com|infosys|information systems|analytics,"SINGAPORE: Three of Singapore's autonomous universities are refining the way they admit students under the Discretionary Admissions Scheme, which looks beyond a person's academic achievements. It comes as the universities prepare to take in more students under the scheme, when the current cap of 10 per cent allowed for discretionary admissions goes up to 15 per cent next year. ADVERTISING inRead invented by Teads National University of Singapore (NUS) is offering 7,000 places for the coming academic year, but it has received four times the number of applicants. While it has started handing out offers to those who made the cut based on their grades, about 1,800 students who did not are undergoing interviews to be considered for discretionary admissions this year. NUS has been evaluating and admitting more students under the scheme over the years. Last year, it evaluated 1,600 students, 400 more than 2014. 670 of them got in, 70 more than 2014. With more students expected to be considered for discretionary admissions, the process at NUS may be refined. Said Professor Tan Eng Chye, deputy president of academic affairs at NUS: “We are evolving; for instance, we have gotten alumni to help us with the interviews. I find that very useful because the alumni have a lot of experience in sizing up people and candidates, and they ask very useful questions. “We also provide more data on what to look out for and if the numbers get to be big, we may decide that maybe we can have sort of a test first - not an academic test per se, but perhaps a test to look at other non-academic aspects of that person. It could be an aptitude test.” Prof Tan added: “Exercising flexibility is one aspect; you also have to be fairly sharp on what to look for - it is not simply: 'OK, meet the numbers.' Our interest is to look for attributes of the applicants that would make the student community more interesting, more diversified, and enhance the interaction within the student community. “Those who can adequately and can eloquently convey their passions and interests - that would be advantageous. But we also have to look out for students who may not be able to communicate as well, but yet they have the potential for us to groom them to be able graduates.” At the Singapore Management University (SMU), discretionary admissions currently form about 5 to 8 per cent of the annual intake. With the higher cap of 15 per cent for such admissions next year, the university will have "more leeway" when assessing students. Professor Pang Yang Hoong, vice provost for undergraduate matters and student development at SMU, said: “For SMU, looking at students with other qualifications is not something terribly new because we always been holistic in the way we assess students and their suitability for admission. We will be more flexible. “(We look for) passion, the aptitude for the course for which we are admitting them into. It would also be ideal if students have demonstrated that they are successful to be in time management, that they also possess resilience and the ability to overcome difficult situations. This will help us to assess if that person has got the resilience and the determination to do well in the programme.” SMU is expecting more polytechnic graduates to apply through the discretionary route with the cap being raised to 15 per cent of the annual intake. Nanyang Technological University (NTU) will also "broaden the criteria", to give more people a shot at securing a place. It will favourably consider those who possess "enthusiasm and relevant work experience". Professor Kam Chan Hin, senior associate provost for undergraduate education at NTU, commented: “Normally, they will look at other achievements that they have - whether in sports, in arts … or even if they are very passionate about community service, leadership. So these are the things that we usually look for. “We are going to encourage all the schools to broaden the criteria, to allow more people who have a very strong passion, to be given the opportunity to be interviewed. We should be more adventurous, open it a bit more and ask more questions, outside of the usual parameters, and if you find somebody who is really very interesting and very passionate … give them a chance.” NTU had evaluated 1,400 students under the scheme last year and about 600 were given a place. All three universities said that even as they exercise flexibility, it is still important for students to show that they possess the "adequate academic competence" to go through the rigour and demands of a university education.  - CNA/ms",13.148333691613786

Why didn't you apply for Humanities & Social Studies instead? [Probing CCAs & Interests -2] 5. Why do you still want to choose NTU instead of NUS? [Universities Choice -3] Below are just my opinions. The interview ended surprisingly faster than expected - far less than 10 minutes. However, there were no questions related to assess my competency for ACBS, and I guess that these questions are completely the same as single degree interview. Also, I doubt they even know what I actually applied for. So for those who are applying ACBS as well, do rest assure.  Comparing NTU and SMU, I find that NTU is more rigid in the way they conduct their interviews. They seem to have a list of standardized questions to be asked. Whereas for SMU, after I spoken about my attachment in one of the Big 4, the whole conversation was all about the work I did, and how I was able to cope with stress in the environment. Very friendly professors. As such, it is much easier to control your conversation topic for SMU. Again, in my opinion, NTU is more interested in how you can contribute to NTU. Whilst for SMU, the professors really want to know you as an individual. Also, the interviewers in NTU seem to be expressionless; it feels that I was talking to robots, but at the very least they did hold eye contact with me. Both are equally efficient in conducting their interviews nevertheless. Generally agree with Aomatsu.  Just to add on, I went for the ACBS interview back in 2014, because, you know, NS, and the main interviewer was Prof Valerie. We had a rather entertaining conversation and it was more of a chit-chat session than an interview. NTU knows what courses you applied for. She had my application form in hard copy on the table (in full view) and asked me why I applied for REP as my 2nd choice, and only put Accountancy (single degree) as the 3rd choice. Other than that, the main focus was definitely on how I would contribute NTU if they offered me a place/scholarship. Of course I talked about joining some clubs in NBS, my career goals and the various competitions/events at NTU which interest me. They didn't ask me those "essay" kind of questions though, but we chatted for around 20 minutes. It was a very light-hearted and enjoyable session and it felt really short in fact. After the interview, the prof invited me to apply for the USP. I also went for the SMU interview (also in 2014) for the double degree programme in Accountancy and Business. I remember being interviewed by Prof Seow and Prof Gary Pan. They seemed really concerned about whether I applied to NUS/NTU and asked me which I would pick if I was offered all 3. It somehow gave me the impression that they were being insecure/desperate. However, I liked the fact that they gave more attention to my hobbies and interests and focused less on academic achievements. I guess this is one example of SMU's holistic admissions process. They were also constantly marketing their school throughout the interview by asking me if I knew that their school of accountancy was ranked xxx in the BYU rankings etc, and kept comparing them to the other 2 unis. What I got out of that interview was that the profs at SMU are really passionate about what they do and that they're incredibly driven especially when it comes to building the school's reputation.  At the end of the day, both are local universities. Employers will lump NUS/NTU/SMU together anyway. So in terms of employability, no difference really. Choose the school which suits your personality better.",13.142454713816718

2016,Singapore Management University|smu,Victoria Junior College|Victoria jc|vjc|computer|com|infosys|information systems|analytics,"Which university? Which course of study?Aim for a course that best suits you, rather than enrol in the most lucrative one Tan Eng Chye Prof Tan is deputy president (academic affairs) and provost at the National University of Singapore. PUBLISHED 6 HOURS AGOhttp://www.straitstimes.com/singapor...ourse-of-study The university admissions season is in full swing, and this is an exciting time for students in Singapore. The tertiary education landscape here has expanded significantly, and there are now many varied and interesting pathways for students to choose from, from traditional professional degree courses in medicine or engineering, to music and the liberal arts and science. Many parents I met at the National University of Singapore's (NUS) Open Day last month remarked that they are envious of the plethora of choices their children have, and wish to be young once more. Some of you may have secured multiple offers from different universities in Singapore and overseas, and you will have to make an acceptance decision soon. But how should one decide? Every year, the Ministry of Education publishes the employment rates and median starting salaries of fresh graduates of the different degree programmes offered by local universities. I certainly hope students do not make decisions based solely on data obtained through the Graduate Employment Survey (GES). GES data provides an indication of starting salaries. Starting salaries are but a guide; they neither set the course nor determine one's career trajectory or destiny. In this volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous or "Vuca" world, one cannot predict the future or where the lucrative jobs will be. You would therefore want your university education to equip you with broad-based life skills, and develop you with the flexibility and resilience needed to pick up new knowledge, adapt to new circumstances, and exploit job opportunities across a variety of sectors throughout your lifetime of careers. Another consideration is whether and how the university course adds value to your educational journey. Some students (and parents) may look to university rankings as a measure of the strength of a university department. And there are definitely synergies between research and education. If the university department excels in research, and counts world-leading researchers in the field, it is likely that cutting-edge research will filter through to your learning experience. You will have the opportunity to be taught by highly regarded academics, and there will be plenty of opportunities to conduct research under the who's-who in the field. This is particularly valuable if you have a very strong interest in research or academia. Choosing a university that excels in your area of interest may also open up more specialised opportunities, such as advanced facilities, academic opportunities such as overseas study or research trips, as well as internships and employment opportunities with prestigious organisations in the industry. Beyond academic reputation, your choice of university will also affect your life intellectually, socially and professionally. You should evaluate the entire student experience, and whether it will suit you. Find out if the social setting on campus is what you would want to be part of. NUS has, for example, the Yale-NUS College and the University Town Residential College programmes, which offer an integrated living and learning experience, amid a collegial and intellectually vibrant setting. Another distinctive programme is the NUS Overseas Colleges programme, where students get to live, work and study in an entrepreneurial hub such as Silicon Valley, New York City or Stockholm, taking entrepreneurship classes at a partner university while working in promising entrepreneurial start-ups. All universities have carefully developed their own suite of programmes and it is worth your time and effort to find out what is on offer. Talk to the professors, and to current students. Universities hold Open Days and various outreach sessions where you can visit the campus and get first-hand information. The best-ranked university or the programme that offers you two degrees in the shortest duration may sound attractive, but they may not necessarily be what you are looking for.  Some of you may want an intensely academic experience, and to pick up as many degrees in the shortest possible time. Yet others may prefer to develop a broader range of capabilities, to try out new things, or to pursue more varied experiences. You should aim to identify a university and a course that best suits you, and not simply enrol in the most competitive or lucrative course. After all, you will be spending your next three to four years in this programme. For those of you whose grades may not meet the degree programme's published entry requirements, do not give up. All local universities have discretionary admissions schemes. Last year, NUS interviewed a record 1,600 students under the scheme, and admitted 670 students. This scheme allows universities to assess applicants more holistically, and to consider their passions and attributes such as leadership, resilience or entrepreneurial skills or talent in non-academic areas. The good news is that from the next academic year onwards, NUS, Nanyang Technological University and Singapore Management University can take in more students under the Discretionary Admissions Scheme, from 10 per cent of the annual intake currently, to up to 15 per cent. This will enable more students to enter universities on the basis of their strengths and talents, beyond academic performance. There is no perfect university. What is key is to make a considered decision with the resources and information that are available to you. Your degree should help start you on the journey to where you want to go. The knowledge, experiences and opportunities in your university life should also prepare you for life beyond your degree. As a student in Singapore, you will have up to the beginning of June to decide on your offers from most of the local universities. Whatever you eventually decide on, make the most of your university experience because, for many, it will be the best time of your life.",14.829153173214898

I was hoping to get some advice from you guys here. Firstly, Congrats to all those who have successful applications. To those who are still waiting, or got rejected, don't feel despair, i'm pretty sure you'll find your way out. Like a professional juggler once told me, his biggest lesson in juggling isn't any particular technically-advanced sleights, but this: "When the ball drops, pick it up." Simple, but means a lot. Now, my story: I am from the '94 batch. Took my A levels in 2012, flunk it really badly, because I was heavily distracted by relationship issues (broke up with my ex, which caused a whole landslide trail of problems. But that's another whole long story, and besides the point). I barely studied during A levels then, and entered the exam hall hoping to fail. But miraculously, i scraped through it, and wasn't allowed to retain in JC. The resultant problem: Straight C result, with one S grade. Devastatingly embarrassing, and was a crushing defeat. You see, I come from an IP school, and that technically means that, should I flunk my A levels, all i'm equivalent of is a Primary 6 standard. So here I am, half of my life, effectively erased on papers. I gone on to enlist in NS, and kept my report card hidden away in the "shameful" corner of my room, collecting dust. After NS, i decided to take a break, took a gap year, all these while, casting aside any thoughts on studies and the education system. I went on to completing 1 internship, and 2 other jobs, as well as backpacking around Europe, South East Asia and Australia. It was fulfilling, and definitely a worthwhile experience. But now, 3 years after receiving my poor A levels result, I finally decided to get back on to the system, and apply for university. Expectedly, even with DA (I was a former national athlete, and I had my employers write in recommendation letters), I was sorrowfully rejected. This time, it hit me hard, after all these years of "escaping", I was finally facing the music, and there and then i knew I had to do sth with my life to move on.TL;DR: I still want to enter university. I know i can do better than that "shitty" result i've got. So here's what I came for, hoping for someone to offer me some advice. Personally, I am contemplating on retaking A levels. My previous subject combination was PMEE. I know my science practical grades could no longer be used, so i have to go to a private institution to do it. I am considering going to MDIS and follow its system. (Question, does anybody have any experience or knowledge or advice on MDIS? Is it a good choice for me?) On top of that, I am intending on going for private tuition to brush up my skills, because i've heard that MDIS tutors aren't the best, or at least they aren't as good as JC MOE teachers. (So, does anybody know of any good 1-to-1 tutors, that could give you undivided attention?) Lastly, is anybody here intending to repeat A levels, I was hoping to form a study group of a couple students, and mug together, and we could encourage one another. This is my one shot, i'm giving my all, and keeping my head in the game. Thank you for reading, hope to get some responses. Really sorry to learn of your predicament. Im in a same situation as u, also from ip. Registration for re taking a levels this year as private candidate has alrdy ended. Have u tried applying to private unis such as sim? Im still waiting for smu and sim to get back to me. If all else fails, maybe we can retake together! If thats the case, i might change my combi to science instead of arts haha",14.372325656409052
2016,Singapore Management University|smu,Victoria Junior College|Victoria jc|vjc|computer|com|infosys|information systems|analytics,"DISCLAIMER: I'd like to say that this post is not meant to flame anyone or put a negative spotlight on anyone. The examples I highlighted below are simply the comments/questions that I spotted which inspired me to write this. I wouldn't want to start a discussion about education in Singapore here, nor would this a debate for JC vs Poly. Just a little background about myself - I was a comms student in poly, did pretty average for my GPA (3.5x), missed the uni application in my first year of army, got rejected by NTU ADM last year, finally got a late acceptance letter from ADM this year. So trust me when I say I can empathise with those who are still waiting for their acceptance letter, and why some people are asking certain questions here.Spoiler!Hi guys, care to give your opinions and views on SMU Business VS NUS Statistics?  Which one will have higher demand by employers? The answer to this is simple, ask yourself where do you want to work? MNC? Local startup? The big 4? Starting your own business? Government sector? The 'value' of a degree is only given to by the people looking at it. Even then, there are those companies in each category that would defy the stereotypical hiring policy. So my advice to the poster who asked this question is to define who are your said 'employers' first. If you have no idea where you want to work or which sector of business you want to be in, it might serve you better to understand more about the course to see which specific programme/school/school culture might suit you better rather which degree appeals more to 'employers'. It's better to make an informed choice yourself.Spoiler!Actually, people do look at where you study. I got a couple of friends in HR. They told me that they would also look at the university, course, GPA/grades, modules taken, then any leadership roles regardless of how many years of relevant work experience a person has. Some say they tend to give more priority to old boys/girls, alum, that sort of thing. I'm not saying you're wrong here buddy, and in fact you're correct in saying this! But like I mentioned previously, it depends on where you're applying for work at, what is the company's hiring policy, what are they looking for etc. Comments like this might mislead some to think that this one degree/choice of school will make or break their future. What your friends experienced are the hiring policies of their particular companies they work at, but it's definitely not the same across various companies.There's no 'one size fits all' answer to certain questions. There is also no 'only one single path' to success. Some students don't realise it yet. This is the point that I'm driving at - Students should not be afraid to seek out multiple answers to a single question. There is always more than one way to solve a single question. Isn't that how it is for Math too? There may be one solution given in the answer book but it doesn't mean that that's the only one.If you do not get your university placing in the public schools this year, there are many other options! For poly students, you can take a gap year and work first, try again next year or the year after, like what I was planning to do myself should I not get my placing this year. Work experience ain't a bad idea too. For JC students, you can always take the A's again (like what some here are planning to do), to get a better grade for your dream course on the next application. I had a friend who couldn't get pharmaceutical, retook his A's while serving NS, scored a much better grade and went on to pharmaceutical on a scholarship in the end. If you really want to study this year, then private schools might be a viable idea as well. Yes things might not have gone according to plan for you. You might have been taught your whole life that you must get into NTU/NUS/SMU, or that might have been pressure on yourself. But fact is, if you're not getting in (even after appeal), then it's on you to take your next step forward. You have to keep moving forward in life despite the obstacles you face. If you're really rejected in the end, allow yourself to be sad for a little while, then pick yourself up, make plans, take the next step forward and move on. You might have to take a little detour, but it doesn't mean you can't get there. It's just how badly you want it. I hope this lengthy post written at 3am in the morning would encourage some of you even a little, because I know what it's like to constantly fail at every turn and have life keep pushing you down. If it did, then I'm glad. ",13.914498946647969

SMU received 1,108 applications for the 45 places in the course, which means about 25 students are vying for every place. The demand for the new course has also led to a rise in total number of applications - 14,000 in all this year, a 6 per cent rise over last year. Earlier this year, when SMU announced the new course, its officials likened it to Oxford University's prestigious politics, philosophy and economics course. It is aimed at giving students a broad understanding of how the world works and will prepare them for a range of careers. Students who had applied for the course said it is an unusual combination since it includes the study of law with economics and politics - and prestigious to boot as it is being offered to only a select group of high-calibre students. Many were also drawn by the fact that the course would prepare them for a wide range of jobs, including in journalism, foreign affairs, public service, consulting and research. SMU provost Lily Kong said she was delighted with the response. She added: "From all our engagement sessions, it is clear that students, parents and employers recognise the value that the PLE combination of disciplines can bring in preparing graduates who can handle multifaceted careers... "Through a deeper understanding of how politics, law and economics intersect to shape the world in which we live, we hope to groom a new generation of leaders and thinkers for Singapore." The 45 students selected for the course will take all three subjects in the first year, before specialising in one of four areas - global studies, distribution and justice, public policy and governance, or choice and behaviour - from year two. Students will also have to go on a 10-week internship during which they will work on a project to find solutions to a real-world problem. SMU said several firms have indicated their interest in offering internships to those on the course. They include the Economic Development Board as well as consultancies like Bain and Company. SMU officials said close to 5,000 of the 14,000 applicants have been shortlisted so far. They will be further assessed via interviews. Professor Kong said that, besides academic results, SMU uses other criteria for admission. "Exam grades are a valid measure, but they cannot be the sole measure of a student's ability." The university is the first in Singapore to require all [shortlisted] candidates to attend an interview. It started the practice 16 years ago, when 2,000 students applied to become part of its pioneer batch. Interviews are still required now, although the number of candidates shortlisted for the six undergraduate degree courses has trebled. They are conducted individually or in groups, with professors on the lookout for intellectual curiosity and leadership qualities. SMU said a select group of students - about 1,000 - with strong academic and other abilities were invited to visit the university on "SMU Discovery Day" this year. Prof Kong said: "Our engagement is directed at confirming that they are indeed an excellent match for the education that SMU offers, and for them to confirm that SMU is the university of choice for them." A-level holder Benedict Lim, 20, who applied for the PLE course, said: "I have an interest in both (law and economics) and had a hard time picking one, so when I heard about SMU's new course, I jumped at the chance." He is keen on a broad-based education as he believes it will train him to be versatile and adaptable and enable him to switch careers. "You know what they say about students having to take on jobs that don't exist today. "I really do believe that. That's why it is best to have a broad-based education, so that you have a broad understanding of issues and how the world works." Probably an inflated nunber What they shld publish rather is the number of ppl putting that as their first choice at smu",13.257581219483185
2016,Singapore Management University|smu,Victoria Junior College|Victoria jc|vjc|computer|com|infosys|information systems|analytics,"SINGAPORE: Three of Singapore's autonomous universities are refining the way they admit students under the Discretionary Admissions Scheme, which looks beyond a person's academic achievements. It comes as the universities prepare to take in more students under the scheme, when the current cap of 10 per cent allowed for discretionary admissions goes up to 15 per cent next year. ADVERTISING inRead invented by Teads National University of Singapore (NUS) is offering 7,000 places for the coming academic year, but it has received four times the number of applicants. While it has started handing out offers to those who made the cut based on their grades, about 1,800 students who did not are undergoing interviews to be considered for discretionary admissions this year. NUS has been evaluating and admitting more students under the scheme over the years. Last year, it evaluated 1,600 students, 400 more than 2014. 670 of them got in, 70 more than 2014. With more students expected to be considered for discretionary admissions, the process at NUS may be refined. Said Professor Tan Eng Chye, deputy president of academic affairs at NUS: “We are evolving; for instance, we have gotten alumni to help us with the interviews. I find that very useful because the alumni have a lot of experience in sizing up people and candidates, and they ask very useful questions. “We also provide more data on what to look out for and if the numbers get to be big, we may decide that maybe we can have sort of a test first - not an academic test per se, but perhaps a test to look at other non-academic aspects of that person. It could be an aptitude test.” Prof Tan added: “Exercising flexibility is one aspect; you also have to be fairly sharp on what to look for - it is not simply: 'OK, meet the numbers.' Our interest is to look for attributes of the applicants that would make the student community more interesting, more diversified, and enhance the interaction within the student community. “Those who can adequately and can eloquently convey their passions and interests - that would be advantageous. But we also have to look out for students who may not be able to communicate as well, but yet they have the potential for us to groom them to be able graduates.” At the Singapore Management University (SMU), discretionary admissions currently form about 5 to 8 per cent of the annual intake. With the higher cap of 15 per cent for such admissions next year, the university will have "more leeway" when assessing students. Professor Pang Yang Hoong, vice provost for undergraduate matters and student development at SMU, said: “For SMU, looking at students with other qualifications is not something terribly new because we always been holistic in the way we assess students and their suitability for admission. We will be more flexible. “(We look for) passion, the aptitude for the course for which we are admitting them into. It would also be ideal if students have demonstrated that they are successful to be in time management, that they also possess resilience and the ability to overcome difficult situations. This will help us to assess if that person has got the resilience and the determination to do well in the programme.” SMU is expecting more polytechnic graduates to apply through the discretionary route with the cap being raised to 15 per cent of the annual intake. Nanyang Technological University (NTU) will also "broaden the criteria", to give more people a shot at securing a place. It will favourably consider those who possess "enthusiasm and relevant work experience". Professor Kam Chan Hin, senior associate provost for undergraduate education at NTU, commented: “Normally, they will look at other achievements that they have - whether in sports, in arts … or even if they are very passionate about community service, leadership. So these are the things that we usually look for. “We are going to encourage all the schools to broaden the criteria, to allow more people who have a very strong passion, to be given the opportunity to be interviewed. We should be more adventurous, open it a bit more and ask more questions, outside of the usual parameters, and if you find somebody who is really very interesting and very passionate … give them a chance.” NTU had evaluated 1,400 students under the scheme last year and about 600 were given a place. All three universities said that even as they exercise flexibility, it is still important for students to show that they possess the "adequate academic competence" to go through the rigour and demands of a university education.  - CNA/ms",13.148333691613786

Also, I doubt they even know what I actually applied for. So for those who are applying ACBS as well, do rest assure.  Comparing NTU and SMU, I find that NTU is more rigid in the way they conduct their interviews. They seem to have a list of standardized questions to be asked. Whereas for SMU, after I spoken about my attachment in one of the Big 4, the whole conversation was all about the work I did, and how I was able to cope with stress in the environment. Very friendly professors. As such, it is much easier to control your conversation topic for SMU. Again, in my opinion, NTU is more interested in how you can contribute to NTU. Whilst for SMU, the professors really want to know you as an individual. Also, the interviewers in NTU seem to be expressionless; it feels that I was talking to robots, but at the very least they did hold eye contact with me. Both are equally efficient in conducting their interviews nevertheless. Generally agree with Aomatsu.  Just to add on, I went for the ACBS interview back in 2014, because, you know, NS, and the main interviewer was Prof Valerie. We had a rather entertaining conversation and it was more of a chit-chat session than an interview. NTU knows what courses you applied for. She had my application form in hard copy on the table (in full view) and asked me why I applied for REP as my 2nd choice, and only put Accountancy (single degree) as the 3rd choice. Other than that, the main focus was definitely on how I would contribute NTU if they offered me a place/scholarship. Of course I talked about joining some clubs in NBS, my career goals and the various competitions/events at NTU which interest me. They didn't ask me those "essay" kind of questions though, but we chatted for around 20 minutes. It was a very light-hearted and enjoyable session and it felt really short in fact. After the interview, the prof invited me to apply for the USP. I also went for the SMU interview (also in 2014) for the double degree programme in Accountancy and Business. I remember being interviewed by Prof Seow and Prof Gary Pan. They seemed really concerned about whether I applied to NUS/NTU and asked me which I would pick if I was offered all 3. It somehow gave me the impression that they were being insecure/desperate. However, I liked the fact that they gave more attention to my hobbies and interests and focused less on academic achievements. I guess this is one example of SMU's holistic admissions process. They were also constantly marketing their school throughout the interview by asking me if I knew that their school of accountancy was ranked xxx in the BYU rankings etc, and kept comparing them to the other 2 unis. What I got out of that interview was that the profs at SMU are really passionate about what they do and that they're incredibly driven especially when it comes to building the school's reputation.  At the end of the day, both are local universities. Employers will lump NUS/NTU/SMU together anyway. So in terms of employability, no difference really. Choose the school which suits your personality better.",13.142454713816718
2016,Singapore Management University|smu,Victoria Junior College|Victoria jc|vjc|computer|com|infosys|information systems|analytics,"New SMU course: 1,108 vying for 45 placesCombination of politics, law and economics proves a winner; total number of applications up 6% to 14,000 Sandra Davie, Senior Education Correspondenthttp://www.straitstimes.com/singapor...-for-45-places A new degree course at Singapore Management University (SMU) which offers a combination of politics, law and economics (PLE) is a hit with young Singaporeans hoping to land a university place this year. SMU received 1,108 applications for the 45 places in the course, which means about 25 students are vying for every place. The demand for the new course has also led to a rise in total number of applications - 14,000 in all this year, a 6 per cent rise over last year. Earlier this year, when SMU announced the new course, its officials likened it to Oxford University's prestigious politics, philosophy and economics course. It is aimed at giving students a broad understanding of how the world works and will prepare them for a range of careers. Students who had applied for the course said it is an unusual combination since it includes the study of law with economics and politics - and prestigious to boot as it is being offered to only a select group of high-calibre students. Many were also drawn by the fact that the course would prepare them for a wide range of jobs, including in journalism, foreign affairs, public service, consulting and research. SMU provost Lily Kong said she was delighted with the response. She added: "From all our engagement sessions, it is clear that students, parents and employers recognise the value that the PLE combination of disciplines can bring in preparing graduates who can handle multifaceted careers... "Through a deeper understanding of how politics, law and economics intersect to shape the world in which we live, we hope to groom a new generation of leaders and thinkers for Singapore." The 45 students selected for the course will take all three subjects in the first year, before specialising in one of four areas - global studies, distribution and justice, public policy and governance, or choice and behaviour - from year two. Students will also have to go on a 10-week internship during which they will work on a project to find solutions to a real-world problem. SMU said several firms have indicated their interest in offering internships to those on the course. They include the Economic Development Board as well as consultancies like Bain and Company. SMU officials said close to 5,000 of the 14,000 applicants have been shortlisted so far. They will be further assessed via interviews. Professor Kong said that, besides academic results, SMU uses other criteria for admission. "Exam grades are a valid measure, but they cannot be the sole measure of a student's ability." The university is the first in Singapore to require all [shortlisted] candidates to attend an interview. It started the practice 16 years ago, when 2,000 students applied to become part of its pioneer batch. Interviews are still required now, although the number of candidates shortlisted for the six undergraduate degree courses has trebled. They are conducted individually or in groups, with professors on the lookout for intellectual curiosity and leadership qualities. SMU said a select group of students - about 1,000 - with strong academic and other abilities were invited to visit the university on "SMU Discovery Day" this year. Prof Kong said: "Our engagement is directed at confirming that they are indeed an excellent match for the education that SMU offers, and for them to confirm that SMU is the university of choice for them." A-level holder Benedict Lim, 20, who applied for the PLE course, said: "I have an interest in both (law and economics) and had a hard time picking one, so when I heard about SMU's new course, I jumped at the chance." He is keen on a broad-based education as he believes it will train him to be versatile and adaptable and enable him to switch careers. "You know what they say about students having to take on jobs that don't exist today. "I really do believe that. That's why it is best to have a broad-based education, so that you have a broad understanding of issues and how the world works."",12.996025800973168

Which course of study?Aim for a course that best suits you, rather than enrol in the most lucrative one Tan Eng Chye Prof Tan is deputy president (academic affairs) and provost at the National University of Singapore. PUBLISHED 6 HOURS AGOhttp://www.straitstimes.com/singapor...ourse-of-study The university admissions season is in full swing, and this is an exciting time for students in Singapore. The tertiary education landscape here has expanded significantly, and there are now many varied and interesting pathways for students to choose from, from traditional professional degree courses in medicine or engineering, to music and the liberal arts and science. Many parents I met at the National University of Singapore's (NUS) Open Day last month remarked that they are envious of the plethora of choices their children have, and wish to be young once more. Some of you may have secured multiple offers from different universities in Singapore and overseas, and you will have to make an acceptance decision soon. But how should one decide? Every year, the Ministry of Education publishes the employment rates and median starting salaries of fresh graduates of the different degree programmes offered by local universities. I certainly hope students do not make decisions based solely on data obtained through the Graduate Employment Survey (GES). GES data provides an indication of starting salaries. Starting salaries are but a guide; they neither set the course nor determine one's career trajectory or destiny. In this volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous or "Vuca" world, one cannot predict the future or where the lucrative jobs will be. You would therefore want your university education to equip you with broad-based life skills, and develop you with the flexibility and resilience needed to pick up new knowledge, adapt to new circumstances, and exploit job opportunities across a variety of sectors throughout your lifetime of careers. Another consideration is whether and how the university course adds value to your educational journey. Some students (and parents) may look to university rankings as a measure of the strength of a university department. And there are definitely synergies between research and education. If the university department excels in research, and counts world-leading researchers in the field, it is likely that cutting-edge research will filter through to your learning experience. You will have the opportunity to be taught by highly regarded academics, and there will be plenty of opportunities to conduct research under the who's-who in the field. This is particularly valuable if you have a very strong interest in research or academia. Choosing a university that excels in your area of interest may also open up more specialised opportunities, such as advanced facilities, academic opportunities such as overseas study or research trips, as well as internships and employment opportunities with prestigious organisations in the industry. Beyond academic reputation, your choice of university will also affect your life intellectually, socially and professionally. You should evaluate the entire student experience, and whether it will suit you. Find out if the social setting on campus is what you would want to be part of. NUS has, for example, the Yale-NUS College and the University Town Residential College programmes, which offer an integrated living and learning experience, amid a collegial and intellectually vibrant setting. Another distinctive programme is the NUS Overseas Colleges programme, where students get to live, work and study in an entrepreneurial hub such as Silicon Valley, New York City or Stockholm, taking entrepreneurship classes at a partner university while working in promising entrepreneurial start-ups. All universities have carefully developed their own suite of programmes and it is worth your time and effort to find out what is on offer. Talk to the professors, and to current students. Universities hold Open Days and various outreach sessions where you can visit the campus and get first-hand information. The best-ranked university or the programme that offers you two degrees in the shortest duration may sound attractive, but they may not necessarily be what you are looking for.  Some of you may want an intensely academic experience, and to pick up as many degrees in the shortest possible time. Yet others may prefer to develop a broader range of capabilities, to try out new things, or to pursue more varied experiences. You should aim to identify a university and a course that best suits you, and not simply enrol in the most competitive or lucrative course. After all, you will be spending your next three to four years in this programme. For those of you whose grades may not meet the degree programme's published entry requirements, do not give up. All local universities have discretionary admissions schemes. Last year, NUS interviewed a record 1,600 students under the scheme, and admitted 670 students. This scheme allows universities to assess applicants more holistically, and to consider their passions and attributes such as leadership, resilience or entrepreneurial skills or talent in non-academic areas. The good news is that from the next academic year onwards, NUS, Nanyang Technological University and Singapore Management University can take in more students under the Discretionary Admissions Scheme, from 10 per cent of the annual intake currently, to up to 15 per cent. This will enable more students to enter universities on the basis of their strengths and talents, beyond academic performance. There is no perfect university. What is key is to make a considered decision with the resources and information that are available to you. Your degree should help start you on the journey to where you want to go. The knowledge, experiences and opportunities in your university life should also prepare you for life beyond your degree. As a student in Singapore, you will have up to the beginning of June to decide on your offers from most of the local universities. Whatever you eventually decide on, make the most of your university experience because, for many, it will be the best time of your life.",14.829153173214898

I was hoping to get some advice from you guys here. Firstly, Congrats to all those who have successful applications. To those who are still waiting, or got rejected, don't feel despair, i'm pretty sure you'll find your way out. Like a professional juggler once told me, his biggest lesson in juggling isn't any particular technically-advanced sleights, but this: "When the ball drops, pick it up." Simple, but means a lot. Now, my story: I am from the '94 batch. Took my A levels in 2012, flunk it really badly, because I was heavily distracted by relationship issues (broke up with my ex, which caused a whole landslide trail of problems. But that's another whole long story, and besides the point). I barely studied during A levels then, and entered the exam hall hoping to fail. But miraculously, i scraped through it, and wasn't allowed to retain in JC. The resultant problem: Straight C result, with one S grade. Devastatingly embarrassing, and was a crushing defeat. You see, I come from an IP school, and that technically means that, should I flunk my A levels, all i'm equivalent of is a Primary 6 standard. So here I am, half of my life, effectively erased on papers. I gone on to enlist in NS, and kept my report card hidden away in the "shameful" corner of my room, collecting dust. After NS, i decided to take a break, took a gap year, all these while, casting aside any thoughts on studies and the education system. I went on to completing 1 internship, and 2 other jobs, as well as backpacking around Europe, South East Asia and Australia. It was fulfilling, and definitely a worthwhile experience. But now, 3 years after receiving my poor A levels result, I finally decided to get back on to the system, and apply for university. Expectedly, even with DA (I was a former national athlete, and I had my employers write in recommendation letters), I was sorrowfully rejected. This time, it hit me hard, after all these years of "escaping", I was finally facing the music, and there and then i knew I had to do sth with my life to move on.TL;DR: I still want to enter university. I know i can do better than that "shitty" result i've got. So here's what I came for, hoping for someone to offer me some advice. Personally, I am contemplating on retaking A levels. My previous subject combination was PMEE. I know my science practical grades could no longer be used, so i have to go to a private institution to do it. I am considering going to MDIS and follow its system. (Question, does anybody have any experience or knowledge or advice on MDIS? Is it a good choice for me?) On top of that, I am intending on going for private tuition to brush up my skills, because i've heard that MDIS tutors aren't the best, or at least they aren't as good as JC MOE teachers. (So, does anybody know of any good 1-to-1 tutors, that could give you undivided attention?) Lastly, is anybody here intending to repeat A levels, I was hoping to form a study group of a couple students, and mug together, and we could encourage one another. This is my one shot, i'm giving my all, and keeping my head in the game. Thank you for reading, hope to get some responses. Really sorry to learn of your predicament. Im in a same situation as u, also from ip. Registration for re taking a levels this year as private candidate has alrdy ended. Have u tried applying to private unis such as sim? Im still waiting for smu and sim to get back to me. If all else fails, maybe we can retake together! If thats the case, i might change my combi to science instead of arts haha",14.372325656409052

The examples I highlighted below are simply the comments/questions that I spotted which inspired me to write this. I wouldn't want to start a discussion about education in Singapore here, nor would this a debate for JC vs Poly. Just a little background about myself - I was a comms student in poly, did pretty average for my GPA (3.5x), missed the uni application in my first year of army, got rejected by NTU ADM last year, finally got a late acceptance letter from ADM this year. So trust me when I say I can empathise with those who are still waiting for their acceptance letter, and why some people are asking certain questions here.Spoiler!Hi guys, care to give your opinions and views on SMU Business VS NUS Statistics?  Which one will have higher demand by employers? The answer to this is simple, ask yourself where do you want to work? MNC? Local startup? The big 4? Starting your own business? Government sector? The 'value' of a degree is only given to by the people looking at it. Even then, there are those companies in each category that would defy the stereotypical hiring policy. So my advice to the poster who asked this question is to define who are your said 'employers' first. If you have no idea where you want to work or which sector of business you want to be in, it might serve you better to understand more about the course to see which specific programme/school/school culture might suit you better rather which degree appeals more to 'employers'. It's better to make an informed choice yourself.Spoiler!Actually, people do look at where you study. I got a couple of friends in HR. They told me that they would also look at the university, course, GPA/grades, modules taken, then any leadership roles regardless of how many years of relevant work experience a person has. Some say they tend to give more priority to old boys/girls, alum, that sort of thing. I'm not saying you're wrong here buddy, and in fact you're correct in saying this! But like I mentioned previously, it depends on where you're applying for work at, what is the company's hiring policy, what are they looking for etc. Comments like this might mislead some to think that this one degree/choice of school will make or break their future. What your friends experienced are the hiring policies of their particular companies they work at, but it's definitely not the same across various companies.There's no 'one size fits all' answer to certain questions. There is also no 'only one single path' to success. Some students don't realise it yet. This is the point that I'm driving at - Students should not be afraid to seek out multiple answers to a single question. There is always more than one way to solve a single question. Isn't that how it is for Math too? There may be one solution given in the answer book but it doesn't mean that that's the only one.If you do not get your university placing in the public schools this year, there are many other options! For poly students, you can take a gap year and work first, try again next year or the year after, like what I was planning to do myself should I not get my placing this year. Work experience ain't a bad idea too. For JC students, you can always take the A's again (like what some here are planning to do), to get a better grade for your dream course on the next application. I had a friend who couldn't get pharmaceutical, retook his A's while serving NS, scored a much better grade and went on to pharmaceutical on a scholarship in the end. If you really want to study this year, then private schools might be a viable idea as well. Yes things might not have gone according to plan for you. You might have been taught your whole life that you must get into NTU/NUS/SMU, or that might have been pressure on yourself. But fact is, if you're not getting in (even after appeal), then it's on you to take your next step forward. You have to keep moving forward in life despite the obstacles you face. If you're really rejected in the end, allow yourself to be sad for a little while, then pick yourself up, make plans, take the next step forward and move on. You might have to take a little detour, but it doesn't mean you can't get there. It's just how badly you want it. I hope this lengthy post written at 3am in the morning would encourage some of you even a little, because I know what it's like to constantly fail at every turn and have life keep pushing you down. If it did, then I'm glad. ",13.914498946647969

It comes as the universities prepare to take in more students under the scheme, when the current cap of 10 per cent allowed for discretionary admissions goes up to 15 per cent next year. ADVERTISING inRead invented by Teads National University of Singapore (NUS) is offering 7,000 places for the coming academic year, but it has received four times the number of applicants. While it has started handing out offers to those who made the cut based on their grades, about 1,800 students who did not are undergoing interviews to be considered for discretionary admissions this year. NUS has been evaluating and admitting more students under the scheme over the years. Last year, it evaluated 1,600 students, 400 more than 2014. 670 of them got in, 70 more than 2014. With more students expected to be considered for discretionary admissions, the process at NUS may be refined. Said Professor Tan Eng Chye, deputy president of academic affairs at NUS: “We are evolving; for instance, we have gotten alumni to help us with the interviews. I find that very useful because the alumni have a lot of experience in sizing up people and candidates, and they ask very useful questions. “We also provide more data on what to look out for and if the numbers get to be big, we may decide that maybe we can have sort of a test first - not an academic test per se, but perhaps a test to look at other non-academic aspects of that person. It could be an aptitude test.” Prof Tan added: “Exercising flexibility is one aspect; you also have to be fairly sharp on what to look for - it is not simply: 'OK, meet the numbers.' Our interest is to look for attributes of the applicants that would make the student community more interesting, more diversified, and enhance the interaction within the student community. “Those who can adequately and can eloquently convey their passions and interests - that would be advantageous. But we also have to look out for students who may not be able to communicate as well, but yet they have the potential for us to groom them to be able graduates.” At the Singapore Management University (SMU), discretionary admissions currently form about 5 to 8 per cent of the annual intake. With the higher cap of 15 per cent for such admissions next year, the university will have "more leeway" when assessing students. Professor Pang Yang Hoong, vice provost for undergraduate matters and student development at SMU, said: “For SMU, looking at students with other qualifications is not something terribly new because we always been holistic in the way we assess students and their suitability for admission. We will be more flexible. “(We look for) passion, the aptitude for the course for which we are admitting them into. It would also be ideal if students have demonstrated that they are successful to be in time management, that they also possess resilience and the ability to overcome difficult situations. This will help us to assess if that person has got the resilience and the determination to do well in the programme.” SMU is expecting more polytechnic graduates to apply through the discretionary route with the cap being raised to 15 per cent of the annual intake. Nanyang Technological University (NTU) will also "broaden the criteria", to give more people a shot at securing a place. It will favourably consider those who possess "enthusiasm and relevant work experience". Professor Kam Chan Hin, senior associate provost for undergraduate education at NTU, commented: “Normally, they will look at other achievements that they have - whether in sports, in arts … or even if they are very passionate about community service, leadership. So these are the things that we usually look for. “We are going to encourage all the schools to broaden the criteria, to allow more people who have a very strong passion, to be given the opportunity to be interviewed. We should be more adventurous, open it a bit more and ask more questions, outside of the usual parameters, and if you find somebody who is really very interesting and very passionate … give them a chance.” NTU had evaluated 1,400 students under the scheme last year and about 600 were given a place. All three universities said that even as they exercise flexibility, it is still important for students to show that they possess the "adequate academic competence" to go through the rigour and demands of a university education.  - CNA/ms",13.148333691613786

Describe yourself. 2. Why do you think we should accept you? How can you contribute to NTU? 3. Did you apply in other Universities as well?Probing Questions 1. Describe yourself in 2 sentences.

Why didn't you apply for Humanities & Social Studies instead? [Probing CCAs & Interests -2] 5. Why do you still want to choose NTU instead of NUS? [Universities Choice -3] Below are just my opinions. The interview ended surprisingly faster than expected - far less than 10 minutes. However, there were no questions related to assess my competency for ACBS, and I guess that these questions are completely the same as single degree interview. Also, I doubt they even know what I actually applied for. So for those who are applying ACBS as well, do rest assure.  Comparing NTU and SMU, I find that NTU is more rigid in the way they conduct their interviews. They seem to have a list of standardized questions to be asked. Whereas for SMU, after I spoken about my attachment in one of the Big 4, the whole conversation was all about the work I did, and how I was able to cope with stress in the environment. Very friendly professors. As such, it is much easier to control your conversation topic for SMU. Again, in my opinion, NTU is more interested in how you can contribute to NTU. Whilst for SMU, the professors really want to know you as an individual. Also, the interviewers in NTU seem to be expressionless; it feels that I was talking to robots, but at the very least they did hold eye contact with me. Both are equally efficient in conducting their interviews nevertheless. Generally agree with Aomatsu.  Just to add on, I went for the ACBS interview back in 2014, because, you know, NS, and the main interviewer was Prof Valerie. We had a rather entertaining conversation and it was more of a chit-chat session than an interview. NTU knows what courses you applied for. She had my application form in hard copy on the table (in full view) and asked me why I applied for REP as my 2nd choice, and only put Accountancy (single degree) as the 3rd choice. Other than that, the main focus was definitely on how I would contribute NTU if they offered me a place/scholarship. Of course I talked about joining some clubs in NBS, my career goals and the various competitions/events at NTU which interest me. They didn't ask me those "essay" kind of questions though, but we chatted for around 20 minutes. It was a very light-hearted and enjoyable session and it felt really short in fact. After the interview, the prof invited me to apply for the USP. I also went for the SMU interview (also in 2014) for the double degree programme in Accountancy and Business. I remember being interviewed by Prof Seow and Prof Gary Pan. They seemed really concerned about whether I applied to NUS/NTU and asked me which I would pick if I was offered all 3. It somehow gave me the impression that they were being insecure/desperate. However, I liked the fact that they gave more attention to my hobbies and interests and focused less on academic achievements. I guess this is one example of SMU's holistic admissions process. They were also constantly marketing their school throughout the interview by asking me if I knew that their school of accountancy was ranked xxx in the BYU rankings etc, and kept comparing them to the other 2 unis. What I got out of that interview was that the profs at SMU are really passionate about what they do and that they're incredibly driven especially when it comes to building the school's reputation.  At the end of the day, both are local universities. Employers will lump NUS/NTU/SMU together anyway. So in terms of employability, no difference really. Choose the school which suits your personality better.",13.142454713816718

SMU received 1,108 applications for the 45 places in the course, which means about 25 students are vying for every place. The demand for the new course has also led to a rise in total number of applications - 14,000 in all this year, a 6 per cent rise over last year. Earlier this year, when SMU announced the new course, its officials likened it to Oxford University's prestigious politics, philosophy and economics course. It is aimed at giving students a broad understanding of how the world works and will prepare them for a range of careers. Students who had applied for the course said it is an unusual combination since it includes the study of law with economics and politics - and prestigious to boot as it is being offered to only a select group of high-calibre students. Many were also drawn by the fact that the course would prepare them for a wide range of jobs, including in journalism, foreign affairs, public service, consulting and research. SMU provost Lily Kong said she was delighted with the response. She added: "From all our engagement sessions, it is clear that students, parents and employers recognise the value that the PLE combination of disciplines can bring in preparing graduates who can handle multifaceted careers... "Through a deeper understanding of how politics, law and economics intersect to shape the world in which we live, we hope to groom a new generation of leaders and thinkers for Singapore." The 45 students selected for the course will take all three subjects in the first year, before specialising in one of four areas - global studies, distribution and justice, public policy and governance, or choice and behaviour - from year two. Students will also have to go on a 10-week internship during which they will work on a project to find solutions to a real-world problem. SMU said several firms have indicated their interest in offering internships to those on the course. They include the Economic Development Board as well as consultancies like Bain and Company. SMU officials said close to 5,000 of the 14,000 applicants have been shortlisted so far. They will be further assessed via interviews. Professor Kong said that, besides academic results, SMU uses other criteria for admission. "Exam grades are a valid measure, but they cannot be the sole measure of a student's ability." The university is the first in Singapore to require all [shortlisted] candidates to attend an interview. It started the practice 16 years ago, when 2,000 students applied to become part of its pioneer batch. Interviews are still required now, although the number of candidates shortlisted for the six undergraduate degree courses has trebled. They are conducted individually or in groups, with professors on the lookout for intellectual curiosity and leadership qualities. SMU said a select group of students - about 1,000 - with strong academic and other abilities were invited to visit the university on "SMU Discovery Day" this year. Prof Kong said: "Our engagement is directed at confirming that they are indeed an excellent match for the education that SMU offers, and for them to confirm that SMU is the university of choice for them."

All students enrolling in NTU academic programmes that lead to the award of a degree must matriculate with the University before commencing their studies. A person's status as a matriculated student will cease when he completes his study and is conferred his degree, or if he opts to withdraw from his study, or when his candidature is terminated by the University. Matriculation carries with it the agreement to abide by University rules and regulations, and codes of conduct.

Would like to contribute what I can:  Local, CPGA 3.64, 4 sem GPA 3.53, LIR4 10? or 12? Can't really remember.  Applied to:  NUS FASS - application STILL processing NTU HSS - offered third choice Linguistics based on 4 sems, will appeal for PPGA or Sociology  SMU Social Science - application STILL processing  For those wondering, I could only apply with my 4 semesters as my internship was on my 5th semester, so no 5th sem results. For NUS and SMU, they have made it clear to me at the many times I asked that they will not be making a decision based on 4 semesters if I don't meet the cut-off and will wait for the full transcript. As for NTU, their policy is to process with 4 semesters anyway and will make decision based on it.  Thankfully, my 4-semesters GPA somehow got me an interview with Linguistics. I was called up in early April, went for the writing test and interview, and got offered 2 days after my interview. When I went, two girls I spoke to both did not put Linguistics as their first choice. I believe most in the room (about 7 of us) possibly also did not do so and they were processing applications pushed down from other courses.  Just like to ask a few things I didn't see answers for despite stalking this thread quite religiously:  1) Those who got rejected - you guys got explicit rejection letters via email?  2) Those who got FASS interview and writing test - may I know what is it about? I am still hoping to DA into FASS but up till now no calls, pretty much nothing.  3) For the NTU appeal, should I write about how I have improved a lot and actually qualify for both PPGA and Soci with my 6-sems or focus on why I want to tranfer into these courses instead? Also, do you appeal specifically into one course or do they just assume you are appealing for whatever courses you didn't get?  4) Anyone applied for CAPT and have gone for the interview already?  As for DA: I did not have a CCA in school but I actively volunteered outside of school and did take on one very big role in one of the biggest community events in SG. Its way above the average amount that students would volunteer so I am hopeful yet at the same time not expectant. Have not seen a case of someone admitted via DA for community service.  I do think that my application remains processing for both NUS and SMU due to the fact that I am very borderline plus my DA is via community service. They have much better applicants to offer to but I am just praying very hard that at the end of this waiting game is good news.  Some other info that may help:  SMU is appearing to be very generous with their Biz Ad interviews this year as I know 3 people with GPAs ranging from 3.5-3.6 being offered interviews, aka already one step in if they don't screw up the interview. Could help that they come from related courses but I hope this give others in the same shoe some hope! No news is good news!  Cheers everybody! I like the positive vibes going on for the NTU appeals. Hope everybody eventually get to where they belong! ",13.642175562900782

What she is trying to say is that the entire admissions process, even with the grades required, is skewed towards the JC kids.  Some examples: 1) Poly application window is in Feb, basically when we are busiest with our last projects in poly life (poly kids will know this as hell week), we still have to complete our application. I am not sure if it applies to every JC, but I know some JC provide guidance to their students in writing their personal statement if required. Poly - I tried to ask for help, but no one could help me lol. I even went for further ed/career guidance counselling but it seems that I know the facts and the competitiveness better than the counselor. So yes, poly is expecting poly kids to go out and work after poly. (But let's be honest - so many of us still want to move onto uni, public or private) JC kids - you all basically on holiday when expected to make an application.  2) As she mentioned - Open House AFTER our application. When I was NUS' Open Day, I went to the admissions booth to ask about something and there was an Indian father with his son from IB, also asking why is the Open House after their application. Yeah, you could say that we can still find out information on our own, call NUS to ask them about their programs if we are interested etc but aren't we just as much of an applicant and prospective student as the JC kids are... But truth is that they are still looking to recruit JC kids that's why the Open Day is so conveniently dated after their A'Level results are released. (P.S.: IB even earlier, apply in Jan) 3) Considering us based on 4 or 5 sems - NTU considered only my 4-semesters worth of results when making an offer as I could only submit 4-sems at the point of application. I am now appealing to my first choice but as all of us here know, chances are very slim. So my question is - why can't they hold onto their decisions and decide with my full cert? My final sem results literally is my entire year 3 modules because 5th sem roll over to the final sem due to FYP judging. Their explanation is for those with 5 sems, usually not much of a diff by the time 6th sem come, which I agree to some extent, but I believe if the student manage to pull up his grades enough to qualify him for the course he wants, it is doing disservice to his efforts. It is like making a decision based on your prelim results for A'Level kids. I am not complaining about how the odds are against us to begin with. I am just asking for the universities to see all applicants as equal, and given an equally fair shot at being considered. Sorry for the long wall of text - I just want to give you guys some context, which I don't think JC kids would know if not.  ((Tbh, poly kids if you all don't have a preference, there are several engineering is not that hard to go in if you don't mind. GPA 3.4? 3.5? to safely secure a place. 3.4/3.5 should be manageable if you don't slack off too much and put in effort for your assignment/projects, and study for your exams.)) Guys stop arguing here. You just need to work hard whichever path you take that's all.  For myself, I went to Poly, achieved CGPA 3.99/4.00. Doing a SMU Double Degree in Business & Accountancy now and my CGPA is 3.90/4.00 - which is Summa Cum Laude, First Class Honours. And my GPA is obviously higher than quite alot of JC/IB students in SMU, even though I'm from Poly. At the end of the day, stop whining and crying over where you came from. Whether you came from a non-privileged or privileged background, if you did not get a spot in a Local Uni you only have yourself to blame because you did not work hard enough during 'A' levels or Poly.  And Poly students, you know fully well that more spots are allocated to JC students. It's a fact. Move on with it. You know that only the top 10 - 15% of the Poly cohort gets Local Uni admissions. So what if it's not equal, the government has been pushing for an increase in no. of spots allocated to Poly students.  And so what if it's not equal? Being the top 10-15% in poly shows your immense pedigree. Same logic goes to applying for Ivy Leagues with acceptance rates of 1%, you gonna complain to them to ask them to increase their acceptance rate? Or you going to work hard to be part of that 1%? Get over it.  And don't even talk about difference in opportunities because even I wasn't born with a silver spoon myself. Wherever you come from, work hard and succeed.

2017,Singapore Management University|smu,Republic Polytechnic|Republic poly|rp|computer|com|infosys|information systems|analytics,"Thanks for the reply! I'm actually currently an ITE (going to be graduating soon) student that's looking on to which polytechnics I should advance on and then subsequently, I intend on going to Uni to do a degree. While I think the PBL-pedagogy is great I would prefer something old school perhaps like at SP, NYP or maybe even NP. I would be okay with joining any of their generalised Business Diplomas, but because my lecturers here at ITE have been telling me to go to RP supposedly ("for increased chances to get top student and go to Uni") hence that was where I was going with my original question on RP students who are mainly from R48, R52- what were their odds on advancing to University. Ultimately, I do not want to jeopardise my chances of getting to Uni if I go to RP, because I think even tho there are some benefits about PBL- the Big3 Unis still have some doubts & stigma about the learning style there at RP. At least that's what I heard when I talked to my lecturers.  Idk about you but I feel RP's Business or "Management" courses feels really lackluster in terms of what they cover unlike other Polys which offer dual specialisation options. Some of these which one can maybe even use in Uni? I would love to hear your thoughts. Thanks for the reply!Plow98 wrote:  I have acquaintances in NUS and SMU Business schools who graduated from RP diplomas (R48 and R52). As none of them has cgpa below 3.94, I presume their admission successes were due to academic excellence.  One RP Diploma in Consumer Behaviour and Research (R48) graduate showed me an offer (screen shot) by a Big 3 Business school, which he actually rejected. Instead, he now partnered another RP School of Management and Communication graduate to run a chain of 5 Mince Meat Noodle stalls at heartland kopitiams. Looks successful by the long self-service queues of hungry customers. Ha Ha. If you are RP, then you are lucky to be PBL trained. You are skilled in resolving real world problems. Can do pretty good presentations in front of a crowd too. Not intimidated by street conditions and battle ready. Right?  Indeed, the greatest gift from RP. I envy you fellows.

As for NTU, their policy is to process with 4 semesters anyway and will make decision based on it.  Thankfully, my 4-semesters GPA somehow got me an interview with Linguistics. I was called up in early April, went for the writing test and interview, and got offered 2 days after my interview. When I went, two girls I spoke to both did not put Linguistics as their first choice. I believe most in the room (about 7 of us) possibly also did not do so and they were processing applications pushed down from other courses.  Just like to ask a few things I didn't see answers for despite stalking this thread quite religiously:  1) Those who got rejected - you guys got explicit rejection letters via email?  2) Those who got FASS interview and writing test - may I know what is it about? I am still hoping to DA into FASS but up till now no calls, pretty much nothing.  3) For the NTU appeal, should I write about how I have improved a lot and actually qualify for both PPGA and Soci with my 6-sems or focus on why I want to tranfer into these courses instead? Also, do you appeal specifically into one course or do they just assume you are appealing for whatever courses you didn't get?  4) Anyone applied for CAPT and have gone for the interview already?  As for DA: I did not have a CCA in school but I actively volunteered outside of school and did take on one very big role in one of the biggest community events in SG. Its way above the average amount that students would volunteer so I am hopeful yet at the same time not expectant. Have not seen a case of someone admitted via DA for community service.  I do think that my application remains processing for both NUS and SMU due to the fact that I am very borderline plus my DA is via community service. They have much better applicants to offer to but I am just praying very hard that at the end of this waiting game is good news.  Some other info that may help:  SMU is appearing to be very generous with their Biz Ad interviews this year as I know 3 people with GPAs ranging from 3.5-3.6 being offered interviews, aka already one step in if they don't screw up the interview. Could help that they come from related courses but I hope this give others in the same shoe some hope! No news is good news!  Cheers everybody! I like the positive vibes going on for the NTU appeals. Hope everybody eventually get to where they belong! ",13.608962303890525

What she is trying to say is that the entire admissions process, even with the grades required, is skewed towards the JC kids.  Some examples: 1) Poly application window is in Feb, basically when we are busiest with our last projects in poly life (poly kids will know this as hell week), we still have to complete our application. I am not sure if it applies to every JC, but I know some JC provide guidance to their students in writing their personal statement if required. Poly - I tried to ask for help, but no one could help me lol. I even went for further ed/career guidance counselling but it seems that I know the facts and the competitiveness better than the counselor. So yes, poly is expecting poly kids to go out and work after poly. (But let's be honest - so many of us still want to move onto uni, public or private) JC kids - you all basically on holiday when expected to make an application.  2) As she mentioned - Open House AFTER our application. When I was NUS' Open Day, I went to the admissions booth to ask about something and there was an Indian father with his son from IB, also asking why is the Open House after their application. Yeah, you could say that we can still find out information on our own, call NUS to ask them about their programs if we are interested etc but aren't we just as much of an applicant and prospective student as the JC kids are... But truth is that they are still looking to recruit JC kids that's why the Open Day is so conveniently dated after their A'Level results are released. (P.S.: IB even earlier, apply in Jan) 3) Considering us based on 4 or 5 sems - NTU considered only my 4-semesters worth of results when making an offer as I could only submit 4-sems at the point of application. I am now appealing to my first choice but as all of us here know, chances are very slim. So my question is - why can't they hold onto their decisions and decide with my full cert? My final sem results literally is my entire year 3 modules because 5th sem roll over to the final sem due to FYP judging. Their explanation is for those with 5 sems, usually not much of a diff by the time 6th sem come, which I agree to some extent, but I believe if the student manage to pull up his grades enough to qualify him for the course he wants, it is doing disservice to his efforts. It is like making a decision based on your prelim results for A'Level kids. I am not complaining about how the odds are against us to begin with. I am just asking for the universities to see all applicants as equal, and given an equally fair shot at being considered. Sorry for the long wall of text - I just want to give you guys some context, which I don't think JC kids would know if not.  ((Tbh, poly kids if you all don't have a preference, there are several engineering is not that hard to go in if you don't mind. GPA 3.4? 3.5? to safely secure a place. 3.4/3.5 should be manageable if you don't slack off too much and put in effort for your assignment/projects, and study for your exams.)) Guys stop arguing here. You just need to work hard whichever path you take that's all.  For myself, I went to Poly, achieved CGPA 3.99/4.00. Doing a SMU Double Degree in Business & Accountancy now and my CGPA is 3.90/4.00 - which is Summa Cum Laude, First Class Honours. And my GPA is obviously higher than quite alot of JC/IB students in SMU, even though I'm from Poly. At the end of the day, stop whining and crying over where you came from. Whether you came from a non-privileged or privileged background, if you did not get a spot in a Local Uni you only have yourself to blame because you did not work hard enough during 'A' levels or Poly.  And Poly students, you know fully well that more spots are allocated to JC students. It's a fact. Move on with it. You know that only the top 10 - 15% of the Poly cohort gets Local Uni admissions. So what if it's not equal, the government has been pushing for an increase in no. of spots allocated to Poly students.  And so what if it's not equal? Being the top 10-15% in poly shows your immense pedigree. Same logic goes to applying for Ivy Leagues with acceptance rates of 1%, you gonna complain to them to ask them to increase their acceptance rate? Or you going to work hard to be part of that 1%? Get over it.  And don't even talk about difference in opportunities because even I wasn't born with a silver spoon myself. Wherever you come from, work hard and succeed.

I'm actually currently an ITE (going to be graduating soon) student that's looking on to which polytechnics I should advance on and then subsequently, I intend on going to Uni to do a degree. While I think the PBL-pedagogy is great I would prefer something old school perhaps like at SP, NYP or maybe even NP. I would be okay with joining any of their generalised Business Diplomas, but because my lecturers here at ITE have been telling me to go to RP supposedly ("for increased chances to get top student and go to Uni") hence that was where I was going with my original question on RP students who are mainly from R48, R52- what were their odds on advancing to University. Ultimately, I do not want to jeopardise my chances of getting to Uni if I go to RP, because I think even tho there are some benefits about PBL- the Big3 Unis still have some doubts & stigma about the learning style there at RP. At least that's what I heard when I talked to my lecturers.  Idk about you but I feel RP's Business or "Management" courses feels really lackluster in terms of what they cover unlike other Polys which offer dual specialisation options. Some of these which one can maybe even use in Uni? I would love to hear your thoughts.

Just like to ask a few things I didn't see answers for despite stalking this thread quite religiously:  1) Those who got rejected - you guys got explicit rejection letters via email?  2) Those who got FASS interview and writing test - may I know what is it about? I am still hoping to DA into FASS but up till now no calls, pretty much nothing.  3) For the NTU appeal, should I write about how I have improved a lot and actually qualify for both PPGA and Soci with my 6-sems or focus on why I want to tranfer into these courses instead? Also, do you appeal specifically into one course or do they just assume you are appealing for whatever courses you didn't get?  4) Anyone applied for CAPT and have gone for the interview already?  As for DA: I did not have a CCA in school but I actively volunteered outside of school and did take on one very big role in one of the biggest community events in SG. Its way above the average amount that students would volunteer so I am hopeful yet at the same time not expectant. Have not seen a case of someone admitted via DA for community service.  I do think that my application remains processing for both NUS and SMU due to the fact that I am very borderline plus my DA is via community service. They have much better applicants to offer to but I am just praying very hard that at the end of this waiting game is good news.  Some other info that may help:  SMU is appearing to be very generous with their Biz Ad interviews this year as I know 3 people with GPAs ranging from 3.5-3.6 being offered interviews, aka already one step in if they don't screw up the interview. Could help that they come from related courses but I hope this give others in the same shoe some hope! No news is good news!  Cheers everybody! I like the positive vibes going on for the NTU appeals. Hope everybody eventually get to where they belong! ",13.646267744231732

What she is trying to say is that the entire admissions process, even with the grades required, is skewed towards the JC kids.  Some examples: 1) Poly application window is in Feb, basically when we are busiest with our last projects in poly life (poly kids will know this as hell week), we still have to complete our application. I am not sure if it applies to every JC, but I know some JC provide guidance to their students in writing their personal statement if required. Poly - I tried to ask for help, but no one could help me lol. I even went for further ed/career guidance counselling but it seems that I know the facts and the competitiveness better than the counselor. So yes, poly is expecting poly kids to go out and work after poly. (But let's be honest - so many of us still want to move onto uni, public or private) JC kids - you all basically on holiday when expected to make an application.  2) As she mentioned - Open House AFTER our application. When I was NUS' Open Day, I went to the admissions booth to ask about something and there was an Indian father with his son from IB, also asking why is the Open House after their application. Yeah, you could say that we can still find out information on our own, call NUS to ask them about their programs if we are interested etc but aren't we just as much of an applicant and prospective student as the JC kids are... But truth is that they are still looking to recruit JC kids that's why the Open Day is so conveniently dated after their A'Level results are released. (P.S.: IB even earlier, apply in Jan) 3) Considering us based on 4 or 5 sems - NTU considered only my 4-semesters worth of results when making an offer as I could only submit 4-sems at the point of application. I am now appealing to my first choice but as all of us here know, chances are very slim. So my question is - why can't they hold onto their decisions and decide with my full cert? My final sem results literally is my entire year 3 modules because 5th sem roll over to the final sem due to FYP judging. Their explanation is for those with 5 sems, usually not much of a diff by the time 6th sem come, which I agree to some extent, but I believe if the student manage to pull up his grades enough to qualify him for the course he wants, it is doing disservice to his efforts. It is like making a decision based on your prelim results for A'Level kids. I am not complaining about how the odds are against us to begin with. I am just asking for the universities to see all applicants as equal, and given an equally fair shot at being considered. Sorry for the long wall of text - I just want to give you guys some context, which I don't think JC kids would know if not.  ((Tbh, poly kids if you all don't have a preference, there are several engineering is not that hard to go in if you don't mind. GPA 3.4? 3.5? to safely secure a place. 3.4/3.5 should be manageable if you don't slack off too much and put in effort for your assignment/projects, and study for your exams.)) Guys stop arguing here. You just need to work hard whichever path you take that's all.  For myself, I went to Poly, achieved CGPA 3.99/4.00. Doing a SMU Double Degree in Business & Accountancy now and my CGPA is 3.90/4.00 - which is Summa Cum Laude, First Class Honours. And my GPA is obviously higher than quite alot of JC/IB students in SMU, even though I'm from Poly. At the end of the day, stop whining and crying over where you came from. Whether you came from a non-privileged or privileged background, if you did not get a spot in a Local Uni you only have yourself to blame because you did not work hard enough during 'A' levels or Poly.  And Poly students, you know fully well that more spots are allocated to JC students. It's a fact. Move on with it. You know that only the top 10 - 15% of the Poly cohort gets Local Uni admissions. So what if it's not equal, the government has been pushing for an increase in no. of spots allocated to Poly students.  And so what if it's not equal? Being the top 10-15% in poly shows your immense pedigree. Same logic goes to applying for Ivy Leagues with acceptance rates of 1%, you gonna complain to them to ask them to increase their acceptance rate? Or you going to work hard to be part of that 1%? Get over it.  And don't even talk about difference in opportunities because even I wasn't born with a silver spoon myself. Wherever you come from, work hard and succeed.

I'm actually currently an ITE (going to be graduating soon) student that's looking on to which polytechnics I should advance on and then subsequently, I intend on going to Uni to do a degree. While I think the PBL-pedagogy is great I would prefer something old school perhaps like at SP, NYP or maybe even NP. I would be okay with joining any of their generalised Business Diplomas, but because my lecturers here at ITE have been telling me to go to RP supposedly ("for increased chances to get top student and go to Uni") hence that was where I was going with my original question on RP students who are mainly from R48, R52- what were their odds on advancing to University. Ultimately, I do not want to jeopardise my chances of getting to Uni if I go to RP, because I think even tho there are some benefits about PBL- the Big3 Unis still have some doubts & stigma about the learning style there at RP. At least that's what I heard when I talked to my lecturers.  Idk about you but I feel RP's Business or "Management" courses feels really lackluster in terms of what they cover unlike other Polys which offer dual specialisation options. Some of these which one can maybe even use in Uni? I would love to hear your thoughts.

Instead, he now partnered another RP School of Management and Communication graduate to run a chain of 5 Mince Meat Noodle stalls at heartland kopitiams.

Actually I have been reading the past few years' threads as well only to realise how I must really buck up on my GPA and thanks to the realisation of how difficult it is to get into uni, I eventually managed to pull up my grades, with lots of stress of course.  Would like to contribute what I can:  Local, CPGA 3.64, 4 sem GPA 3.53, LIR4 10? or 12? Can't really remember.  Applied to:  NUS FASS - application STILL processing NTU HSS - offered third choice Linguistics based on 4 sems, will appeal for PPGA or Sociology  SMU Social Science - application STILL processing  For those wondering, I could only apply with my 4 semesters as my internship was on my 5th semester, so no 5th sem results. For NUS and SMU, they have made it clear to me at the many times I asked that they will not be making a decision based on 4 semesters if I don't meet the cut-off and will wait for the full transcript. As for NTU, their policy is to process with 4 semesters anyway and will make decision based on it.  Thankfully, my 4-semesters GPA somehow got me an interview with Linguistics. I was called up in early April, went for the writing test and interview, and got offered 2 days after my interview. When I went, two girls I spoke to both did not put Linguistics as their first choice. I believe most in the room (about 7 of us) possibly also did not do so and they were processing applications pushed down from other courses.  Just like to ask a few things I didn't see answers for despite stalking this thread quite religiously:  1) Those who got rejected - you guys got explicit rejection letters via email?  2) Those who got FASS interview and writing test - may I know what is it about? I am still hoping to DA into FASS but up till now no calls, pretty much nothing.  3) For the NTU appeal, should I write about how I have improved a lot and actually qualify for both PPGA and Soci with my 6-sems or focus on why I want to tranfer into these courses instead? Also, do you appeal specifically into one course or do they just assume you are appealing for whatever courses you didn't get?  4) Anyone applied for CAPT and have gone for the interview already?  As for DA: I did not have a CCA in school but I actively volunteered outside of school and did take on one very big role in one of the biggest community events in SG. Its way above the average amount that students would volunteer so I am hopeful yet at the same time not expectant. Have not seen a case of someone admitted via DA for community service.  I do think that my application remains processing for both NUS and SMU due to the fact that I am very borderline plus my DA is via community service. They have much better applicants to offer to but I am just praying very hard that at the end of this waiting game is good news.  Some other info that may help:  SMU is appearing to be very generous with their Biz Ad interviews this year as I know 3 people with GPAs ranging from 3.5-3.6 being offered interviews, aka already one step in if they don't screw up the interview. Could help that they come from related courses but I hope this give others in the same shoe some hope! No news is good news!  Cheers everybody! I like the positive vibes going on for the NTU appeals.

What she is trying to say is that the entire admissions process, even with the grades required, is skewed towards the JC kids.  Some examples: 1) Poly application window is in Feb, basically when we are busiest with our last projects in poly life (poly kids will know this as hell week), we still have to complete our application. I am not sure if it applies to every JC, but I know some JC provide guidance to their students in writing their personal statement if required. Poly - I tried to ask for help, but no one could help me lol. I even went for further ed/career guidance counselling but it seems that I know the facts and the competitiveness better than the counselor. So yes, poly is expecting poly kids to go out and work after poly. (But let's be honest - so many of us still want to move onto uni, public or private) JC kids - you all basically on holiday when expected to make an application.  2) As she mentioned - Open House AFTER our application. When I was NUS' Open Day, I went to the admissions booth to ask about something and there was an Indian father with his son from IB, also asking why is the Open House after their application. Yeah, you could say that we can still find out information on our own, call NUS to ask them about their programs if we are interested etc but aren't we just as much of an applicant and prospective student as the JC kids are... But truth is that they are still looking to recruit JC kids that's why the Open Day is so conveniently dated after their A'Level results are released. (P.S.: IB even earlier, apply in Jan) 3) Considering us based on 4 or 5 sems - NTU considered only my 4-semesters worth of results when making an offer as I could only submit 4-sems at the point of application. I am now appealing to my first choice but as all of us here know, chances are very slim. So my question is - why can't they hold onto their decisions and decide with my full cert? My final sem results literally is my entire year 3 modules because 5th sem roll over to the final sem due to FYP judging. Their explanation is for those with 5 sems, usually not much of a diff by the time 6th sem come, which I agree to some extent, but I believe if the student manage to pull up his grades enough to qualify him for the course he wants, it is doing disservice to his efforts. It is like making a decision based on your prelim results for A'Level kids. I am not complaining about how the odds are against us to begin with. I am just asking for the universities to see all applicants as equal, and given an equally fair shot at being considered. Sorry for the long wall of text - I just want to give you guys some context, which I don't think JC kids would know if not.  ((Tbh, poly kids if you all don't have a preference, there are several engineering is not that hard to go in if you don't mind. GPA 3.4? 3.5? to safely secure a place. 3.4/3.5 should be manageable if you don't slack off too much and put in effort for your assignment/projects, and study for your exams.)) Guys stop arguing here. You just need to work hard whichever path you take that's all.  For myself, I went to Poly, achieved CGPA 3.99/4.00. Doing a SMU Double Degree in Business & Accountancy now and my CGPA is 3.90/4.00 - which is Summa Cum Laude, First Class Honours. And my GPA is obviously higher than quite alot of JC/IB students in SMU, even though I'm from Poly. At the end of the day, stop whining and crying over where you came from. Whether you came from a non-privileged or privileged background, if you did not get a spot in a Local Uni you only have yourself to blame because you did not work hard enough during 'A' levels or Poly.  And Poly students, you know fully well that more spots are allocated to JC students. It's a fact. Move on with it. You know that only the top 10 - 15% of the Poly cohort gets Local Uni admissions. So what if it's not equal, the government has been pushing for an increase in no. of spots allocated to Poly students.  And so what if it's not equal? Being the top 10-15% in poly shows your immense pedigree. Same logic goes to applying for Ivy Leagues with acceptance rates of 1%, you gonna complain to them to ask them to increase their acceptance rate? Or you going to work hard to be part of that 1%? Get over it.  And don't even talk about difference in opportunities because even I wasn't born with a silver spoon myself. Wherever you come from, work hard and succeed.

I'm actually currently an ITE (going to be graduating soon) student that's looking on to which polytechnics I should advance on and then subsequently, I intend on going to Uni to do a degree. While I think the PBL-pedagogy is great I would prefer something old school perhaps like at SP, NYP or maybe even NP. I would be okay with joining any of their generalised Business Diplomas, but because my lecturers here at ITE have been telling me to go to RP supposedly ("for increased chances to get top student and go to Uni") hence that was where I was going with my original question on RP students who are mainly from R48, R52- what were their odds on advancing to University. Ultimately, I do not want to jeopardise my chances of getting to Uni if I go to RP, because I think even tho there are some benefits about PBL- the Big3 Unis still have some doubts & stigma about the learning style there at RP. At least that's what I heard when I talked to my lecturers.  Idk about you but I feel RP's Business or "Management" courses feels really lackluster in terms of what they cover unlike other Polys which offer dual specialisation options. Some of these which one can maybe even use in Uni? I would love to hear your thoughts.

Instead, he now partnered another RP School of Management and Communication graduate to run a chain of 5 Mince Meat Noodle stalls at heartland kopitiams.

Actually I have been reading the past few years' threads as well only to realise how I must really buck up on my GPA and thanks to the realisation of how difficult it is to get into uni, I eventually managed to pull up my grades, with lots of stress of course.  Would like to contribute what I can:  Local, CPGA 3.64, 4 sem GPA 3.53, LIR4 10? or 12? Can't really remember.  Applied to:  NUS FASS - application STILL processing NTU HSS - offered third choice Linguistics based on 4 sems, will appeal for PPGA or Sociology  SMU Social Science - application STILL processing  For those wondering, I could only apply with my 4 semesters as my internship was on my 5th semester, so no 5th sem results. For NUS and SMU, they have made it clear to me at the many times I asked that they will not be making a decision based on 4 semesters if I don't meet the cut-off and will wait for the full transcript. As for NTU, their policy is to process with 4 semesters anyway and will make decision based on it.  Thankfully, my 4-semesters GPA somehow got me an interview with Linguistics. I was called up in early April, went for the writing test and interview, and got offered 2 days after my interview. When I went, two girls I spoke to both did not put Linguistics as their first choice. I believe most in the room (about 7 of us) possibly also did not do so and they were processing applications pushed down from other courses.  Just like to ask a few things I didn't see answers for despite stalking this thread quite religiously:  1) Those who got rejected - you guys got explicit rejection letters via email?  2) Those who got FASS interview and writing test - may I know what is it about? I am still hoping to DA into FASS but up till now no calls, pretty much nothing.  3) For the NTU appeal, should I write about how I have improved a lot and actually qualify for both PPGA and Soci with my 6-sems or focus on why I want to tranfer into these courses instead? Also, do you appeal specifically into one course or do they just assume you are appealing for whatever courses you didn't get?  4) Anyone applied for CAPT and have gone for the interview already?

What she is trying to say is that the entire admissions process, even with the grades required, is skewed towards the JC kids.  Some examples: 1) Poly application window is in Feb, basically when we are busiest with our last projects in poly life (poly kids will know this as hell week), we still have to complete our application. I am not sure if it applies to every JC, but I know some JC provide guidance to their students in writing their personal statement if required. Poly - I tried to ask for help, but no one could help me lol. I even went for further ed/career guidance counselling but it seems that I know the facts and the competitiveness better than the counselor. So yes, poly is expecting poly kids to go out and work after poly. (But let's be honest - so many of us still want to move onto uni, public or private) JC kids - you all basically on holiday when expected to make an application.  2) As she mentioned - Open House AFTER our application. When I was NUS' Open Day, I went to the admissions booth to ask about something and there was an Indian father with his son from IB, also asking why is the Open House after their application. Yeah, you could say that we can still find out information on our own, call NUS to ask them about their programs if we are interested etc but aren't we just as much of an applicant and prospective student as the JC kids are... But truth is that they are still looking to recruit JC kids that's why the Open Day is so conveniently dated after their A'Level results are released. (P.S.: IB even earlier, apply in Jan) 3) Considering us based on 4 or 5 sems - NTU considered only my 4-semesters worth of results when making an offer as I could only submit 4-sems at the point of application. I am now appealing to my first choice but as all of us here know, chances are very slim. So my question is - why can't they hold onto their decisions and decide with my full cert? My final sem results literally is my entire year 3 modules because 5th sem roll over to the final sem due to FYP judging. Their explanation is for those with 5 sems, usually not much of a diff by the time 6th sem come, which I agree to some extent, but I believe if the student manage to pull up his grades enough to qualify him for the course he wants, it is doing disservice to his efforts. It is like making a decision based on your prelim results for A'Level kids. I am not complaining about how the odds are against us to begin with. I am just asking for the universities to see all applicants as equal, and given an equally fair shot at being considered. Sorry for the long wall of text - I just want to give you guys some context, which I don't think JC kids would know if not.  ((Tbh, poly kids if you all don't have a preference, there are several engineering is not that hard to go in if you don't mind. GPA 3.4? 3.5? to safely secure a place. 3.4/3.5 should be manageable if you don't slack off too much and put in effort for your assignment/projects, and study for your exams.)) Guys stop arguing here. You just need to work hard whichever path you take that's all.  For myself, I went to Poly, achieved CGPA 3.99/4.00. Doing a SMU Double Degree in Business & Accountancy now and my CGPA is 3.90/4.00 - which is Summa Cum Laude, First Class Honours. And my GPA is obviously higher than quite alot of JC/IB students in SMU, even though I'm from Poly. At the end of the day, stop whining and crying over where you came from. Whether you came from a non-privileged or privileged background, if you did not get a spot in a Local Uni you only have yourself to blame because you did not work hard enough during 'A' levels or Poly.  And Poly students, you know fully well that more spots are allocated to JC students. It's a fact. Move on with it. You know that only the top 10 - 15% of the Poly cohort gets Local Uni admissions. So what if it's not equal, the government has been pushing for an increase in no. of spots allocated to Poly students.  And so what if it's not equal? Being the top 10-15% in poly shows your immense pedigree. Same logic goes to applying for Ivy Leagues with acceptance rates of 1%, you gonna complain to them to ask them to increase their acceptance rate? Or you going to work hard to be part of that 1%? Get over it.  And don't even talk about difference in opportunities because even I wasn't born with a silver spoon myself. Wherever you come from, work hard and succeed.

I'm actually currently an ITE (going to be graduating soon) student that's looking on to which polytechnics I should advance on and then subsequently, I intend on going to Uni to do a degree. While I think the PBL-pedagogy is great I would prefer something old school perhaps like at SP, NYP or maybe even NP. I would be okay with joining any of their generalised Business Diplomas, but because my lecturers here at ITE have been telling me to go to RP supposedly ("for increased chances to get top student and go to Uni") hence that was where I was going with my original question on RP students who are mainly from R48, R52- what were their odds on advancing to University. Ultimately, I do not want to jeopardise my chances of getting to Uni if I go to RP, because I think even tho there are some benefits about PBL- the Big3 Unis still have some doubts & stigma about the learning style there at RP. At least that's what I heard when I talked to my lecturers.  Idk about you but I feel RP's Business or "Management" courses feels really lackluster in terms of what they cover unlike other Polys which offer dual specialisation options. Some of these which one can maybe even use in Uni? I would love to hear your thoughts.

Actually I have been reading the past few years' threads as well only to realise how I must really buck up on my GPA and thanks to the realisation of how difficult it is to get into uni, I eventually managed to pull up my grades, with lots of stress of course.  Would like to contribute what I can:  Local, CPGA 3.64, 4 sem GPA 3.53, LIR4 10? or 12? Can't really remember.  Applied to:  NUS FASS - application STILL processing NTU HSS - offered third choice Linguistics based on 4 sems, will appeal for PPGA or Sociology  SMU Social Science - application STILL processing  For those wondering, I could only apply with my 4 semesters as my internship was on my 5th semester, so no 5th sem results. For NUS and SMU, they have made it clear to me at the many times I asked that they will not be making a decision based on 4 semesters if I don't meet the cut-off and will wait for the full transcript. As for NTU, their policy is to process with 4 semesters anyway and will make decision based on it.  Thankfully, my 4-semesters GPA somehow got me an interview with Linguistics. I was called up in early April, went for the writing test and interview, and got offered 2 days after my interview. When I went, two girls I spoke to both did not put Linguistics as their first choice. I believe most in the room (about 7 of us) possibly also did not do so and they were processing applications pushed down from other courses.  Just like to ask a few things I didn't see answers for despite stalking this thread quite religiously:  1) Those who got rejected - you guys got explicit rejection letters via email?  2) Those who got FASS interview and writing test - may I know what is it about? I am still hoping to DA into FASS but up till now no calls, pretty much nothing.  3) For the NTU appeal, should I write about how I have improved a lot and actually qualify for both PPGA and Soci with my 6-sems or focus on why I want to tranfer into these courses instead? Also, do you appeal specifically into one course or do they just assume you are appealing for whatever courses you didn't get?  4) Anyone applied for CAPT and have gone for the interview already?  As for DA: I did not have a CCA in school but I actively volunteered outside of school and did take on one very big role in one of the biggest community events in SG. Its way above the average amount that students would volunteer so I am hopeful yet at the same time not expectant. Have not seen a case of someone admitted via DA for community service.  I do think that my application remains processing for both NUS and SMU due to the fact that I am very borderline plus my DA is via community service. They have much better applicants to offer to but I am just praying very hard that at the end of this waiting game is good news.  Some other info that may help:  SMU is appearing to be very generous with their Biz Ad interviews this year as I know 3 people with GPAs ranging from 3.5-3.6 being offered interviews, aka already one step in if they don't screw up the interview.

What she is trying to say is that the entire admissions process, even with the grades required, is skewed towards the JC kids.  Some examples: 1) Poly application window is in Feb, basically when we are busiest with our last projects in poly life (poly kids will know this as hell week), we still have to complete our application. I am not sure if it applies to every JC, but I know some JC provide guidance to their students in writing their personal statement if required. Poly - I tried to ask for help, but no one could help me lol. I even went for further ed/career guidance counselling but it seems that I know the facts and the competitiveness better than the counselor. So yes, poly is expecting poly kids to go out and work after poly. (But let's be honest - so many of us still want to move onto uni, public or private) JC kids - you all basically on holiday when expected to make an application.  2) As she mentioned - Open House AFTER our application. When I was NUS' Open Day, I went to the admissions booth to ask about something and there was an Indian father with his son from IB, also asking why is the Open House after their application. Yeah, you could say that we can still find out information on our own, call NUS to ask them about their programs if we are interested etc but aren't we just as much of an applicant and prospective student as the JC kids are... But truth is that they are still looking to recruit JC kids that's why the Open Day is so conveniently dated after their A'Level results are released. (P.S.: IB even earlier, apply in Jan) 3) Considering us based on 4 or 5 sems - NTU considered only my 4-semesters worth of results when making an offer as I could only submit 4-sems at the point of application. I am now appealing to my first choice but as all of us here know, chances are very slim. So my question is - why can't they hold onto their decisions and decide with my full cert? My final sem results literally is my entire year 3 modules because 5th sem roll over to the final sem due to FYP judging. Their explanation is for those with 5 sems, usually not much of a diff by the time 6th sem come, which I agree to some extent, but I believe if the student manage to pull up his grades enough to qualify him for the course he wants, it is doing disservice to his efforts. It is like making a decision based on your prelim results for A'Level kids. I am not complaining about how the odds are against us to begin with. I am just asking for the universities to see all applicants as equal, and given an equally fair shot at being considered. Sorry for the long wall of text - I just want to give you guys some context, which I don't think JC kids would know if not.  ((Tbh, poly kids if you all don't have a preference, there are several engineering is not that hard to go in if you don't mind. GPA 3.4? 3.5? to safely secure a place. 3.4/3.5 should be manageable if you don't slack off too much and put in effort for your assignment/projects, and study for your exams.)) Guys stop arguing here. You just need to work hard whichever path you take that's all.  For myself, I went to Poly, achieved CGPA 3.99/4.00. Doing a SMU Double Degree in Business & Accountancy now and my CGPA is 3.90/4.00 - which is Summa Cum Laude, First Class Honours. And my GPA is obviously higher than quite alot of JC/IB students in SMU, even though I'm from Poly. At the end of the day, stop whining and crying over where you came from. Whether you came from a non-privileged or privileged background, if you did not get a spot in a Local Uni you only have yourself to blame because you did not work hard enough during 'A' levels or Poly.  And Poly students, you know fully well that more spots are allocated to JC students. It's a fact. Move on with it. You know that only the top 10 - 15% of the Poly cohort gets Local Uni admissions. So what if it's not equal, the government has been pushing for an increase in no. of spots allocated to Poly students.  And so what if it's not equal? Being the top 10-15% in poly shows your immense pedigree. Same logic goes to applying for Ivy Leagues with acceptance rates of 1%, you gonna complain to them to ask them to increase their acceptance rate? Or you going to work hard to be part of that 1%? Get over it.  And don't even talk about difference in opportunities because even I wasn't born with a silver spoon myself. Wherever you come from, work hard and succeed.

I'm actually currently an ITE (going to be graduating soon) student that's looking on to which polytechnics I should advance on and then subsequently, I intend on going to Uni to do a degree. While I think the PBL-pedagogy is great I would prefer something old school perhaps like at SP, NYP or maybe even NP. I would be okay with joining any of their generalised Business Diplomas, but because my lecturers here at ITE have been telling me to go to RP supposedly ("for increased chances to get top student and go to Uni") hence that was where I was going with my original question on RP students who are mainly from R48, R52- what were their odds on advancing to University. Ultimately, I do not want to jeopardise my chances of getting to Uni if I go to RP, because I think even tho there are some benefits about PBL- the Big3 Unis still have some doubts & stigma about the learning style there at RP. At least that's what I heard when I talked to my lecturers.  Idk about you but I feel RP's Business or "Management" courses feels really lackluster in terms of what they cover unlike other Polys which offer dual specialisation options. Some of these which one can maybe even use in Uni? I would love to hear your thoughts.

2017,Singapore Management University|smu,Anglo-Chinese Junior College|anglo chinese junior college|anglo-chinese jc|acjc|computer|com|infosys|information systems|analytics,"Hi all,  Signing up for an account and posting for the first time as this thread has given me a lot of information and insight into the whole application process.  Actually I have been reading the past few years' threads as well only to realise how I must really buck up on my GPA and thanks to the realisation of how difficult it is to get into uni, I eventually managed to pull up my grades, with lots of stress of course.  Would like to contribute what I can:  Local, CPGA 3.64, 4 sem GPA 3.53, LIR4 10? or 12? Can't really remember.  Applied to:  NUS FASS - application STILL processing NTU HSS - offered third choice Linguistics based on 4 sems, will appeal for PPGA or Sociology  SMU Social Science - application STILL processing  For those wondering, I could only apply with my 4 semesters as my internship was on my 5th semester, so no 5th sem results. For NUS and SMU, they have made it clear to me at the many times I asked that they will not be making a decision based on 4 semesters if I don't meet the cut-off and will wait for the full transcript. As for NTU, their policy is to process with 4 semesters anyway and will make decision based on it.  Thankfully, my 4-semesters GPA somehow got me an interview with Linguistics. I was called up in early April, went for the writing test and interview, and got offered 2 days after my interview. When I went, two girls I spoke to both did not put Linguistics as their first choice. I believe most in the room (about 7 of us) possibly also did not do so and they were processing applications pushed down from other courses.  Just like to ask a few things I didn't see answers for despite stalking this thread quite religiously:  1) Those who got rejected - you guys got explicit rejection letters via email?  2) Those who got FASS interview and writing test - may I know what is it about? I am still hoping to DA into FASS but up till now no calls, pretty much nothing.  3) For the NTU appeal, should I write about how I have improved a lot and actually qualify for both PPGA and Soci with my 6-sems or focus on why I want to tranfer into these courses instead? Also, do you appeal specifically into one course or do they just assume you are appealing for whatever courses you didn't get?  4) Anyone applied for CAPT and have gone for the interview already?  As for DA: I did not have a CCA in school but I actively volunteered outside of school and did take on one very big role in one of the biggest community events in SG. Its way above the average amount that students would volunteer so I am hopeful yet at the same time not expectant. Have not seen a case of someone admitted via DA for community service.  I do think that my application remains processing for both NUS and SMU due to the fact that I am very borderline plus my DA is via community service. They have much better applicants to offer to but I am just praying very hard that at the end of this waiting game is good news.  Some other info that may help:  SMU is appearing to be very generous with their Biz Ad interviews this year as I know 3 people with GPAs ranging from 3.5-3.6 being offered interviews, aka already one step in if they don't screw up the interview.

What she is trying to say is that the entire admissions process, even with the grades required, is skewed towards the JC kids.  Some examples: 1) Poly application window is in Feb, basically when we are busiest with our last projects in poly life (poly kids will know this as hell week), we still have to complete our application. I am not sure if it applies to every JC, but I know some JC provide guidance to their students in writing their personal statement if required. Poly - I tried to ask for help, but no one could help me lol. I even went for further ed/career guidance counselling but it seems that I know the facts and the competitiveness better than the counselor. So yes, poly is expecting poly kids to go out and work after poly. (But let's be honest - so many of us still want to move onto uni, public or private) JC kids - you all basically on holiday when expected to make an application.  2) As she mentioned - Open House AFTER our application. When I was NUS' Open Day, I went to the admissions booth to ask about something and there was an Indian father with his son from IB, also asking why is the Open House after their application. Yeah, you could say that we can still find out information on our own, call NUS to ask them about their programs if we are interested etc but aren't we just as much of an applicant and prospective student as the JC kids are... But truth is that they are still looking to recruit JC kids that's why the Open Day is so conveniently dated after their A'Level results are released. (P.S.: IB even earlier, apply in Jan) 3) Considering us based on 4 or 5 sems - NTU considered only my 4-semesters worth of results when making an offer as I could only submit 4-sems at the point of application. I am now appealing to my first choice but as all of us here know, chances are very slim. So my question is - why can't they hold onto their decisions and decide with my full cert? My final sem results literally is my entire year 3 modules because 5th sem roll over to the final sem due to FYP judging. Their explanation is for those with 5 sems, usually not much of a diff by the time 6th sem come, which I agree to some extent, but I believe if the student manage to pull up his grades enough to qualify him for the course he wants, it is doing disservice to his efforts. It is like making a decision based on your prelim results for A'Level kids. I am not complaining about how the odds are against us to begin with. I am just asking for the universities to see all applicants as equal, and given an equally fair shot at being considered. Sorry for the long wall of text - I just want to give you guys some context, which I don't think JC kids would know if not.  ((Tbh, poly kids if you all don't have a preference, there are several engineering is not that hard to go in if you don't mind. GPA 3.4? 3.5? to safely secure a place. 3.4/3.5 should be manageable if you don't slack off too much and put in effort for your assignment/projects, and study for your exams.)) Guys stop arguing here. You just need to work hard whichever path you take that's all.  For myself, I went to Poly, achieved CGPA 3.99/4.00. Doing a SMU Double Degree in Business & Accountancy now and my CGPA is 3.90/4.00 - which is Summa Cum Laude, First Class Honours. And my GPA is obviously higher than quite alot of JC/IB students in SMU, even though I'm from Poly. At the end of the day, stop whining and crying over where you came from. Whether you came from a non-privileged or privileged background, if you did not get a spot in a Local Uni you only have yourself to blame because you did not work hard enough during 'A' levels or Poly.  And Poly students, you know fully well that more spots are allocated to JC students. It's a fact. Move on with it. You know that only the top 10 - 15% of the Poly cohort gets Local Uni admissions. So what if it's not equal, the government has been pushing for an increase in no. of spots allocated to Poly students.  And so what if it's not equal? Being the top 10-15% in poly shows your immense pedigree. Same logic goes to applying for Ivy Leagues with acceptance rates of 1%, you gonna complain to them to ask them to increase their acceptance rate? Or you going to work hard to be part of that 1%? Get over it.  And don't even talk about difference in opportunities because even I wasn't born with a silver spoon myself. Wherever you come from, work hard and succeed.

I'm actually currently an ITE (going to be graduating soon) student that's looking on to which polytechnics I should advance on and then subsequently, I intend on going to Uni to do a degree. While I think the PBL-pedagogy is great I would prefer something old school perhaps like at SP, NYP or maybe even NP. I would be okay with joining any of their generalised Business Diplomas, but because my lecturers here at ITE have been telling me to go to RP supposedly ("for increased chances to get top student and go to Uni") hence that was where I was going with my original question on RP students who are mainly from R48, R52- what were their odds on advancing to University. Ultimately, I do not want to jeopardise my chances of getting to Uni if I go to RP, because I think even tho there are some benefits about PBL- the Big3 Unis still have some doubts & stigma about the learning style there at RP. At least that's what I heard when I talked to my lecturers.  Idk about you but I feel RP's Business or "Management" courses feels really lackluster in terms of what they cover unlike other Polys which offer dual specialisation options. Some of these which one can maybe even use in Uni? I would love to hear your thoughts.

Actually I have been reading the past few years' threads as well only to realise how I must really buck up on my GPA and thanks to the realisation of how difficult it is to get into uni, I eventually managed to pull up my grades, with lots of stress of course.  Would like to contribute what I can:  Local, CPGA 3.64, 4 sem GPA 3.53, LIR4 10? or 12? Can't really remember.  Applied to:  NUS FASS - application STILL processing NTU HSS - offered third choice Linguistics based on 4 sems, will appeal for PPGA or Sociology  SMU Social Science - application STILL processing  For those wondering, I could only apply with my 4 semesters as my internship was on my 5th semester, so no 5th sem results. For NUS and SMU, they have made it clear to me at the many times I asked that they will not be making a decision based on 4 semesters if I don't meet the cut-off and will wait for the full transcript. As for NTU, their policy is to process with 4 semesters anyway and will make decision based on it.  Thankfully, my 4-semesters GPA somehow got me an interview with Linguistics. I was called up in early April, went for the writing test and interview, and got offered 2 days after my interview. When I went, two girls I spoke to both did not put Linguistics as their first choice. I believe most in the room (about 7 of us) possibly also did not do so and they were processing applications pushed down from other courses.  Just like to ask a few things I didn't see answers for despite stalking this thread quite religiously:  1) Those who got rejected - you guys got explicit rejection letters via email?  2) Those who got FASS interview and writing test - may I know what is it about? I am still hoping to DA into FASS but up till now no calls, pretty much nothing.  3) For the NTU appeal, should I write about how I have improved a lot and actually qualify for both PPGA and Soci with my 6-sems or focus on why I want to tranfer into these courses instead? Also, do you appeal specifically into one course or do they just assume you are appealing for whatever courses you didn't get?  4) Anyone applied for CAPT and have gone for the interview already?  As for DA: I did not have a CCA in school but I actively volunteered outside of school and did take on one very big role in one of the biggest community events in SG. Its way above the average amount that students would volunteer so I am hopeful yet at the same time not expectant. Have not seen a case of someone admitted via DA for community service.  I do think that my application remains processing for both NUS and SMU due to the fact that I am very borderline plus my DA is via community service. They have much better applicants to offer to but I am just praying very hard that at the end of this waiting game is good news.  Some other info that may help:  SMU is appearing to be very generous with their Biz Ad interviews this year as I know 3 people with GPAs ranging from 3.5-3.6 being offered interviews, aka already one step in if they don't screw up the interview. Could help that they come from related courses but I hope this give others in the same shoe some hope! No news is good news!  Cheers everybody! I like the positive vibes going on for the NTU appeals. Hope everybody eventually get to where they belong! ",13.626150825437827

I am not sure if it applies to every JC, but I know some JC provide guidance to their students in writing their personal statement if required. Poly - I tried to ask for help, but no one could help me lol. I even went for further ed/career guidance counselling but it seems that I know the facts and the competitiveness better than the counselor. So yes, poly is expecting poly kids to go out and work after poly. (But let's be honest - so many of us still want to move onto uni, public or private) JC kids - you all basically on holiday when expected to make an application.  2) As she mentioned - Open House AFTER our application. When I was NUS' Open Day, I went to the admissions booth to ask about something and there was an Indian father with his son from IB, also asking why is the Open House after their application. Yeah, you could say that we can still find out information on our own, call NUS to ask them about their programs if we are interested etc but aren't we just as much of an applicant and prospective student as the JC kids are... But truth is that they are still looking to recruit JC kids that's why the Open Day is so conveniently dated after their A'Level results are released. (P.S.: IB even earlier, apply in Jan) 3) Considering us based on 4 or 5 sems - NTU considered only my 4-semesters worth of results when making an offer as I could only submit 4-sems at the point of application. I am now appealing to my first choice but as all of us here know, chances are very slim. So my question is - why can't they hold onto their decisions and decide with my full cert? My final sem results literally is my entire year 3 modules because 5th sem roll over to the final sem due to FYP judging. Their explanation is for those with 5 sems, usually not much of a diff by the time 6th sem come, which I agree to some extent, but I believe if the student manage to pull up his grades enough to qualify him for the course he wants, it is doing disservice to his efforts. It is like making a decision based on your prelim results for A'Level kids. I am not complaining about how the odds are against us to begin with. I am just asking for the universities to see all applicants as equal, and given an equally fair shot at being considered. Sorry for the long wall of text - I just want to give you guys some context, which I don't think JC kids would know if not.  ((Tbh, poly kids if you all don't have a preference, there are several engineering is not that hard to go in if you don't mind. GPA 3.4? 3.5? to safely secure a place. 3.4/3.5 should be manageable if you don't slack off too much and put in effort for your assignment/projects, and study for your exams.)) Guys stop arguing here. You just need to work hard whichever path you take that's all.  For myself, I went to Poly, achieved CGPA 3.99/4.00. Doing a SMU Double Degree in Business & Accountancy now and my CGPA is 3.90/4.00 - which is Summa Cum Laude, First Class Honours. And my GPA is obviously higher than quite alot of JC/IB students in SMU, even though I'm from Poly. At the end of the day, stop whining and crying over where you came from. Whether you came from a non-privileged or privileged background, if you did not get a spot in a Local Uni you only have yourself to blame because you did not work hard enough during 'A' levels or Poly.  And Poly students, you know fully well that more spots are allocated to JC students. It's a fact. Move on with it. You know that only the top 10 - 15% of the Poly cohort gets Local Uni admissions. So what if it's not equal, the government has been pushing for an increase in no. of spots allocated to Poly students.  And so what if it's not equal? Being the top 10-15% in poly shows your immense pedigree. Same logic goes to applying for Ivy Leagues with acceptance rates of 1%, you gonna complain to them to ask them to increase their acceptance rate? Or you going to work hard to be part of that 1%? Get over it.  And don't even talk about difference in opportunities because even I wasn't born with a silver spoon myself. Wherever you come from, work hard and succeed.

I'm actually currently an ITE (going to be graduating soon) student that's looking on to which polytechnics I should advance on and then subsequently, I intend on going to Uni to do a degree. While I think the PBL-pedagogy is great I would prefer something old school perhaps like at SP, NYP or maybe even NP. I would be okay with joining any of their generalised Business Diplomas, but because my lecturers here at ITE have been telling me to go to RP supposedly ("for increased chances to get top student and go to Uni") hence that was where I was going with my original question on RP students who are mainly from R48, R52- what were their odds on advancing to University. Ultimately, I do not want to jeopardise my chances of getting to Uni if I go to RP, because I think even tho there are some benefits about PBL- the Big3 Unis still have some doubts & stigma about the learning style there at RP. At least that's what I heard when I talked to my lecturers.  Idk about you but I feel RP's Business or "Management" courses feels really lackluster in terms of what they cover unlike other Polys which offer dual specialisation options. Some of these which one can maybe even use in Uni? I would love to hear your thoughts.

2017,Singapore Management University|smu,Dunman High School|Dunman|dhs|computer|com|infosys|information systems|analytics,"Hi all,  Signing up for an account and posting for the first time as this thread has given me a lot of information and insight into the whole application process.  Actually I have been reading the past few years' threads as well only to realise how I must really buck up on my GPA and thanks to the realisation of how difficult it is to get into uni, I eventually managed to pull up my grades, with lots of stress of course.  Would like to contribute what I can:  Local, CPGA 3.64, 4 sem GPA 3.53, LIR4 10? or 12? Can't really remember.  Applied to:  NUS FASS - application STILL processing NTU HSS - offered third choice Linguistics based on 4 sems, will appeal for PPGA or Sociology  SMU Social Science - application STILL processing  For those wondering, I could only apply with my 4 semesters as my internship was on my 5th semester, so no 5th sem results. For NUS and SMU, they have made it clear to me at the many times I asked that they will not be making a decision based on 4 semesters if I don't meet the cut-off and will wait for the full transcript. As for NTU, their policy is to process with 4 semesters anyway and will make decision based on it.  Thankfully, my 4-semesters GPA somehow got me an interview with Linguistics. I was called up in early April, went for the writing test and interview, and got offered 2 days after my interview. When I went, two girls I spoke to both did not put Linguistics as their first choice. I believe most in the room (about 7 of us) possibly also did not do so and they were processing applications pushed down from other courses.  Just like to ask a few things I didn't see answers for despite stalking this thread quite religiously:  1) Those who got rejected - you guys got explicit rejection letters via email?  2) Those who got FASS interview and writing test - may I know what is it about? I am still hoping to DA into FASS but up till now no calls, pretty much nothing.  3) For the NTU appeal, should I write about how I have improved a lot and actually qualify for both PPGA and Soci with my 6-sems or focus on why I want to tranfer into these courses instead? Also, do you appeal specifically into one course or do they just assume you are appealing for whatever courses you didn't get?  4) Anyone applied for CAPT and have gone for the interview already?  As for DA: I did not have a CCA in school but I actively volunteered outside of school and did take on one very big role in one of the biggest community events in SG. Its way above the average amount that students would volunteer so I am hopeful yet at the same time not expectant. Have not seen a case of someone admitted via DA for community service.  I do think that my application remains processing for both NUS and SMU due to the fact that I am very borderline plus my DA is via community service. They have much better applicants to offer to but I am just praying very hard that at the end of this waiting game is good news.  Some other info that may help:  SMU is appearing to be very generous with their Biz Ad interviews this year as I know 3 people with GPAs ranging from 3.5-3.6 being offered interviews, aka already one step in if they don't screw up the interview. Could help that they come from related courses but I hope this give others in the same shoe some hope! No news is good news!  Cheers everybody! I like the positive vibes going on for the NTU appeals. Hope everybody eventually get to where they belong! ",13.626150825437827

Yeah, you could say that we can still find out information on our own, call NUS to ask them about their programs if we are interested etc but aren't we just as much of an applicant and prospective student as the JC kids are... But truth is that they are still looking to recruit JC kids that's why the Open Day is so conveniently dated after their A'Level results are released. (P.S.: IB even earlier, apply in Jan) 3) Considering us based on 4 or 5 sems - NTU considered only my 4-semesters worth of results when making an offer as I could only submit 4-sems at the point of application. I am now appealing to my first choice but as all of us here know, chances are very slim. So my question is - why can't they hold onto their decisions and decide with my full cert? My final sem results literally is my entire year 3 modules because 5th sem roll over to the final sem due to FYP judging. Their explanation is for those with 5 sems, usually not much of a diff by the time 6th sem come, which I agree to some extent, but I believe if the student manage to pull up his grades enough to qualify him for the course he wants, it is doing disservice to his efforts. It is like making a decision based on your prelim results for A'Level kids. I am not complaining about how the odds are against us to begin with. I am just asking for the universities to see all applicants as equal, and given an equally fair shot at being considered. Sorry for the long wall of text - I just want to give you guys some context, which I don't think JC kids would know if not.  ((Tbh, poly kids if you all don't have a preference, there are several engineering is not that hard to go in if you don't mind. GPA 3.4? 3.5? to safely secure a place. 3.4/3.5 should be manageable if you don't slack off too much and put in effort for your assignment/projects, and study for your exams.)) Guys stop arguing here. You just need to work hard whichever path you take that's all.  For myself, I went to Poly, achieved CGPA 3.99/4.00. Doing a SMU Double Degree in Business & Accountancy now and my CGPA is 3.90/4.00 - which is Summa Cum Laude, First Class Honours. And my GPA is obviously higher than quite alot of JC/IB students in SMU, even though I'm from Poly. At the end of the day, stop whining and crying over where you came from. Whether you came from a non-privileged or privileged background, if you did not get a spot in a Local Uni you only have yourself to blame because you did not work hard enough during 'A' levels or Poly.  And Poly students, you know fully well that more spots are allocated to JC students. It's a fact. Move on with it. You know that only the top 10 - 15% of the Poly cohort gets Local Uni admissions. So what if it's not equal, the government has been pushing for an increase in no. of spots allocated to Poly students.  And so what if it's not equal? Being the top 10-15% in poly shows your immense pedigree. Same logic goes to applying for Ivy Leagues with acceptance rates of 1%, you gonna complain to them to ask them to increase their acceptance rate? Or you going to work hard to be part of that 1%? Get over it.  And don't even talk about difference in opportunities because even I wasn't born with a silver spoon myself. Wherever you come from, work hard and succeed.

I'm actually currently an ITE (going to be graduating soon) student that's looking on to which polytechnics I should advance on and then subsequently, I intend on going to Uni to do a degree. While I think the PBL-pedagogy is great I would prefer something old school perhaps like at SP, NYP or maybe even NP. I would be okay with joining any of their generalised Business Diplomas, but because my lecturers here at ITE have been telling me to go to RP supposedly ("for increased chances to get top student and go to Uni") hence that was where I was going with my original question on RP students who are mainly from R48, R52- what were their odds on advancing to University. Ultimately, I do not want to jeopardise my chances of getting to Uni if I go to RP, because I think even tho there are some benefits about PBL- the Big3 Unis still have some doubts & stigma about the learning style there at RP. At least that's what I heard when I talked to my lecturers.  Idk about you but I feel RP's Business or "Management" courses feels really lackluster in terms of what they cover unlike other Polys which offer dual specialisation options. Some of these which one can maybe even use in Uni? I would love to hear your thoughts.

2017,Singapore Management University|smu,Eunoia Junior College|Eunoia jc|ejc|computer|com|infosys|information systems|analytics,"Hi all,  Signing up for an account and posting for the first time as this thread has given me a lot of information and insight into the whole application process.  Actually I have been reading the past few years' threads as well only to realise how I must really buck up on my GPA and thanks to the realisation of how difficult it is to get into uni, I eventually managed to pull up my grades, with lots of stress of course.  Would like to contribute what I can:  Local, CPGA 3.64, 4 sem GPA 3.53, LIR4 10? or 12? Can't really remember.  Applied to:  NUS FASS - application STILL processing NTU HSS - offered third choice Linguistics based on 4 sems, will appeal for PPGA or Sociology  SMU Social Science - application STILL processing  For those wondering, I could only apply with my 4 semesters as my internship was on my 5th semester, so no 5th sem results. For NUS and SMU, they have made it clear to me at the many times I asked that they will not be making a decision based on 4 semesters if I don't meet the cut-off and will wait for the full transcript. As for NTU, their policy is to process with 4 semesters anyway and will make decision based on it.  Thankfully, my 4-semesters GPA somehow got me an interview with Linguistics. I was called up in early April, went for the writing test and interview, and got offered 2 days after my interview. When I went, two girls I spoke to both did not put Linguistics as their first choice. I believe most in the room (about 7 of us) possibly also did not do so and they were processing applications pushed down from other courses.  Just like to ask a few things I didn't see answers for despite stalking this thread quite religiously:  1) Those who got rejected - you guys got explicit rejection letters via email?  2) Those who got FASS interview and writing test - may I know what is it about? I am still hoping to DA into FASS but up till now no calls, pretty much nothing.  3) For the NTU appeal, should I write about how I have improved a lot and actually qualify for both PPGA and Soci with my 6-sems or focus on why I want to tranfer into these courses instead? Also, do you appeal specifically into one course or do they just assume you are appealing for whatever courses you didn't get?  4) Anyone applied for CAPT and have gone for the interview already?  As for DA: I did not have a CCA in school but I actively volunteered outside of school and did take on one very big role in one of the biggest community events in SG. Its way above the average amount that students would volunteer so I am hopeful yet at the same time not expectant. Have not seen a case of someone admitted via DA for community service.  I do think that my application remains processing for both NUS and SMU due to the fact that I am very borderline plus my DA is via community service. They have much better applicants to offer to but I am just praying very hard that at the end of this waiting game is good news.  Some other info that may help:  SMU is appearing to be very generous with their Biz Ad interviews this year as I know 3 people with GPAs ranging from 3.5-3.6 being offered interviews, aka already one step in if they don't screw up the interview. Could help that they come from related courses but I hope this give others in the same shoe some hope! No news is good news!  Cheers everybody! I like the positive vibes going on for the NTU appeals. Hope everybody eventually get to where they belong! ",13.626150825437827

What she is trying to say is that the entire admissions process, even with the grades required, is skewed towards the JC kids.  Some examples: 1) Poly application window is in Feb, basically when we are busiest with our last projects in poly life (poly kids will know this as hell week), we still have to complete our application. I am not sure if it applies to every JC, but I know some JC provide guidance to their students in writing their personal statement if required. Poly - I tried to ask for help, but no one could help me lol. I even went for further ed/career guidance counselling but it seems that I know the facts and the competitiveness better than the counselor. So yes, poly is expecting poly kids to go out and work after poly. (But let's be honest - so many of us still want to move onto uni, public or private) JC kids - you all basically on holiday when expected to make an application.  2) As she mentioned - Open House AFTER our application. When I was NUS' Open Day, I went to the admissions booth to ask about something and there was an Indian father with his son from IB, also asking why is the Open House after their application. Yeah, you could say that we can still find out information on our own, call NUS to ask them about their programs if we are interested etc but aren't we just as much of an applicant and prospective student as the JC kids are... But truth is that they are still looking to recruit JC kids that's why the Open Day is so conveniently dated after their A'Level results are released. (P.S.: IB even earlier, apply in Jan) 3) Considering us based on 4 or 5 sems - NTU considered only my 4-semesters worth of results when making an offer as I could only submit 4-sems at the point of application. I am now appealing to my first choice but as all of us here know, chances are very slim. So my question is - why can't they hold onto their decisions and decide with my full cert? My final sem results literally is my entire year 3 modules because 5th sem roll over to the final sem due to FYP judging. Their explanation is for those with 5 sems, usually not much of a diff by the time 6th sem come, which I agree to some extent, but I believe if the student manage to pull up his grades enough to qualify him for the course he wants, it is doing disservice to his efforts. It is like making a decision based on your prelim results for A'Level kids. I am not complaining about how the odds are against us to begin with. I am just asking for the universities to see all applicants as equal, and given an equally fair shot at being considered. Sorry for the long wall of text - I just want to give you guys some context, which I don't think JC kids would know if not.  ((Tbh, poly kids if you all don't have a preference, there are several engineering is not that hard to go in if you don't mind. GPA 3.4? 3.5? to safely secure a place. 3.4/3.5 should be manageable if you don't slack off too much and put in effort for your assignment/projects, and study for your exams.)) Guys stop arguing here. You just need to work hard whichever path you take that's all.  For myself, I went to Poly, achieved CGPA 3.99/4.00. Doing a SMU Double Degree in Business & Accountancy now and my CGPA is 3.90/4.00 - which is Summa Cum Laude, First Class Honours. And my GPA is obviously higher than quite alot of JC/IB students in SMU, even though I'm from Poly. At the end of the day, stop whining and crying over where you came from. Whether you came from a non-privileged or privileged background, if you did not get a spot in a Local Uni you only have yourself to blame because you did not work hard enough during 'A' levels or Poly.  And Poly students, you know fully well that more spots are allocated to JC students. It's a fact. Move on with it. You know that only the top 10 - 15% of the Poly cohort gets Local Uni admissions. So what if it's not equal, the government has been pushing for an increase in no. of spots allocated to Poly students.  And so what if it's not equal? Being the top 10-15% in poly shows your immense pedigree. Same logic goes to applying for Ivy Leagues with acceptance rates of 1%, you gonna complain to them to ask them to increase their acceptance rate? Or you going to work hard to be part of that 1%? Get over it.  And don't even talk about difference in opportunities because even I wasn't born with a silver spoon myself. Wherever you come from, work hard and succeed.

I'm actually currently an ITE (going to be graduating soon) student that's looking on to which polytechnics I should advance on and then subsequently, I intend on going to Uni to do a degree. While I think the PBL-pedagogy is great I would prefer something old school perhaps like at SP, NYP or maybe even NP. I would be okay with joining any of their generalised Business Diplomas, but because my lecturers here at ITE have been telling me to go to RP supposedly ("for increased chances to get top student and go to Uni") hence that was where I was going with my original question on RP students who are mainly from R48, R52- what were their odds on advancing to University. Ultimately, I do not want to jeopardise my chances of getting to Uni if I go to RP, because I think even tho there are some benefits about PBL- the Big3 Unis still have some doubts & stigma about the learning style there at RP. At least that's what I heard when I talked to my lecturers.  Idk about you but I feel RP's Business or "Management" courses feels really lackluster in terms of what they cover unlike other Polys which offer dual specialisation options. Some of these which one can maybe even use in Uni? I would love to hear your thoughts.

Instead, he now partnered another RP School of Management and Communication graduate to run a chain of 5 Mince Meat Noodle stalls at heartland kopitiams.

2017,Singapore Management University|smu,Hwa Chong Junior College|hwa chong|hc|hcjc|computer|com|infosys|information systems|analytics,"Hi all,  Signing up for an account and posting for the first time as this thread has given me a lot of information and insight into the whole application process.  Actually I have been reading the past few years' threads as well only to realise how I must really buck up on my GPA and thanks to the realisation of how difficult it is to get into uni, I eventually managed to pull up my grades, with lots of stress of course.  Would like to contribute what I can:  Local, CPGA 3.64, 4 sem GPA 3.53, LIR4 10? or 12? Can't really remember.  Applied to:  NUS FASS - application STILL processing NTU HSS - offered third choice Linguistics based on 4 sems, will appeal for PPGA or Sociology  SMU Social Science - application STILL processing  For those wondering, I could only apply with my 4 semesters as my internship was on my 5th semester, so no 5th sem results. For NUS and SMU, they have made it clear to me at the many times I asked that they will not be making a decision based on 4 semesters if I don't meet the cut-off and will wait for the full transcript. As for NTU, their policy is to process with 4 semesters anyway and will make decision based on it.  Thankfully, my 4-semesters GPA somehow got me an interview with Linguistics. I was called up in early April, went for the writing test and interview, and got offered 2 days after my interview. When I went, two girls I spoke to both did not put Linguistics as their first choice. I believe most in the room (about 7 of us) possibly also did not do so and they were processing applications pushed down from other courses.  Just like to ask a few things I didn't see answers for despite stalking this thread quite religiously:  1) Those who got rejected - you guys got explicit rejection letters via email?  2) Those who got FASS interview and writing test - may I know what is it about? I am still hoping to DA into FASS but up till now no calls, pretty much nothing.  3) For the NTU appeal, should I write about how I have improved a lot and actually qualify for both PPGA and Soci with my 6-sems or focus on why I want to tranfer into these courses instead? Also, do you appeal specifically into one course or do they just assume you are appealing for whatever courses you didn't get?  4) Anyone applied for CAPT and have gone for the interview already?  As for DA: I did not have a CCA in school but I actively volunteered outside of school and did take on one very big role in one of the biggest community events in SG. Its way above the average amount that students would volunteer so I am hopeful yet at the same time not expectant. Have not seen a case of someone admitted via DA for community service.  I do think that my application remains processing for both NUS and SMU due to the fact that I am very borderline plus my DA is via community service. They have much better applicants to offer to but I am just praying very hard that at the end of this waiting game is good news.  Some other info that may help:  SMU is appearing to be very generous with their Biz Ad interviews this year as I know 3 people with GPAs ranging from 3.5-3.6 being offered interviews, aka already one step in if they don't screw up the interview. Could help that they come from related courses but I hope this give others in the same shoe some hope! No news is good news!  Cheers everybody! I like the positive vibes going on for the NTU appeals. Hope everybody eventually get to where they belong! ",13.625928794938906

What she is trying to say is that the entire admissions process, even with the grades required, is skewed towards the JC kids.  Some examples: 1) Poly application window is in Feb, basically when we are busiest with our last projects in poly life (poly kids will know this as hell week), we still have to complete our application. I am not sure if it applies to every JC, but I know some JC provide guidance to their students in writing their personal statement if required. Poly - I tried to ask for help, but no one could help me lol. I even went for further ed/career guidance counselling but it seems that I know the facts and the competitiveness better than the counselor. So yes, poly is expecting poly kids to go out and work after poly. (But let's be honest - so many of us still want to move onto uni, public or private) JC kids - you all basically on holiday when expected to make an application.  2) As she mentioned - Open House AFTER our application. When I was NUS' Open Day, I went to the admissions booth to ask about something and there was an Indian father with his son from IB, also asking why is the Open House after their application. Yeah, you could say that we can still find out information on our own, call NUS to ask them about their programs if we are interested etc but aren't we just as much of an applicant and prospective student as the JC kids are... But truth is that they are still looking to recruit JC kids that's why the Open Day is so conveniently dated after their A'Level results are released. (P.S.: IB even earlier, apply in Jan) 3) Considering us based on 4 or 5 sems - NTU considered only my 4-semesters worth of results when making an offer as I could only submit 4-sems at the point of application.

Sorry for the long wall of text - I just want to give you guys some context, which I don't think JC kids would know if not.  ((Tbh, poly kids if you all don't have a preference, there are several engineering is not that hard to go in if you don't mind. GPA 3.4? 3.5? to safely secure a place. 3.4/3.5 should be manageable if you don't slack off too much and put in effort for your assignment/projects, and study for your exams.)) Guys stop arguing here. You just need to work hard whichever path you take that's all.  For myself, I went to Poly, achieved CGPA 3.99/4.00. Doing a SMU Double Degree in Business & Accountancy now and my CGPA is 3.90/4.00 - which is Summa Cum Laude, First Class Honours. And my GPA is obviously higher than quite alot of JC/IB students in SMU, even though I'm from Poly. At the end of the day, stop whining and crying over where you came from. Whether you came from a non-privileged or privileged background, if you did not get a spot in a Local Uni you only have yourself to blame because you did not work hard enough during 'A' levels or Poly.  And Poly students, you know fully well that more spots are allocated to JC students. It's a fact. Move on with it. You know that only the top 10 - 15% of the Poly cohort gets Local Uni admissions. So what if it's not equal, the government has been pushing for an increase in no. of spots allocated to Poly students.  And so what if it's not equal? Being the top 10-15% in poly shows your immense pedigree. Same logic goes to applying for Ivy Leagues with acceptance rates of 1%, you gonna complain to them to ask them to increase their acceptance rate? Or you going to work hard to be part of that 1%? Get over it.  And don't even talk about difference in opportunities because even I wasn't born with a silver spoon myself. Wherever you come from, work hard and succeed.

I'm actually currently an ITE (going to be graduating soon) student that's looking on to which polytechnics I should advance on and then subsequently, I intend on going to Uni to do a degree. While I think the PBL-pedagogy is great I would prefer something old school perhaps like at SP, NYP or maybe even NP. I would be okay with joining any of their generalised Business Diplomas, but because my lecturers here at ITE have been telling me to go to RP supposedly ("for increased chances to get top student and go to Uni") hence that was where I was going with my original question on RP students who are mainly from R48, R52- what were their odds on advancing to University. Ultimately, I do not want to jeopardise my chances of getting to Uni if I go to RP, because I think even tho there are some benefits about PBL- the Big3 Unis still have some doubts & stigma about the learning style there at RP. At least that's what I heard when I talked to my lecturers.  Idk about you but I feel RP's Business or "Management" courses feels really lackluster in terms of what they cover unlike other Polys which offer dual specialisation options. Some of these which one can maybe even use in Uni? I would love to hear your thoughts.

2017,Singapore Management University|smu,Innova Junior College|innova jc|ijc|computer|com|infosys|information systems|analytics,"Hi all,  Signing up for an account and posting for the first time as this thread has given me a lot of information and insight into the whole application process.  Actually I have been reading the past few years' threads as well only to realise how I must really buck up on my GPA and thanks to the realisation of how difficult it is to get into uni, I eventually managed to pull up my grades, with lots of stress of course.  Would like to contribute what I can:  Local, CPGA 3.64, 4 sem GPA 3.53, LIR4 10? or 12? Can't really remember.  Applied to:  NUS FASS - application STILL processing NTU HSS - offered third choice Linguistics based on 4 sems, will appeal for PPGA or Sociology  SMU Social Science - application STILL processing  For those wondering, I could only apply with my 4 semesters as my internship was on my 5th semester, so no 5th sem results. For NUS and SMU, they have made it clear to me at the many times I asked that they will not be making a decision based on 4 semesters if I don't meet the cut-off and will wait for the full transcript. As for NTU, their policy is to process with 4 semesters anyway and will make decision based on it.  Thankfully, my 4-semesters GPA somehow got me an interview with Linguistics. I was called up in early April, went for the writing test and interview, and got offered 2 days after my interview. When I went, two girls I spoke to both did not put Linguistics as their first choice. I believe most in the room (about 7 of us) possibly also did not do so and they were processing applications pushed down from other courses.  Just like to ask a few things I didn't see answers for despite stalking this thread quite religiously:  1) Those who got rejected - you guys got explicit rejection letters via email?  2) Those who got FASS interview and writing test - may I know what is it about? I am still hoping to DA into FASS but up till now no calls, pretty much nothing.  3) For the NTU appeal, should I write about how I have improved a lot and actually qualify for both PPGA and Soci with my 6-sems or focus on why I want to tranfer into these courses instead? Also, do you appeal specifically into one course or do they just assume you are appealing for whatever courses you didn't get?  4) Anyone applied for CAPT and have gone for the interview already?  As for DA: I did not have a CCA in school but I actively volunteered outside of school and did take on one very big role in one of the biggest community events in SG. Its way above the average amount that students would volunteer so I am hopeful yet at the same time not expectant. Have not seen a case of someone admitted via DA for community service.  I do think that my application remains processing for both NUS and SMU due to the fact that I am very borderline plus my DA is via community service. They have much better applicants to offer to but I am just praying very hard that at the end of this waiting game is good news.  Some other info that may help:  SMU is appearing to be very generous with their Biz Ad interviews this year as I know 3 people with GPAs ranging from 3.5-3.6 being offered interviews, aka already one step in if they don't screw up the interview. Could help that they come from related courses but I hope this give others in the same shoe some hope! No news is good news!  Cheers everybody! I like the positive vibes going on for the NTU appeals. Hope everybody eventually get to where they belong! ",13.626150825437827

What she is trying to say is that the entire admissions process, even with the grades required, is skewed towards the JC kids.  Some examples: 1) Poly application window is in Feb, basically when we are busiest with our last projects in poly life (poly kids will know this as hell week), we still have to complete our application. I am not sure if it applies to every JC, but I know some JC provide guidance to their students in writing their personal statement if required. Poly - I tried to ask for help, but no one could help me lol. I even went for further ed/career guidance counselling but it seems that I know the facts and the competitiveness better than the counselor. So yes, poly is expecting poly kids to go out and work after poly. (But let's be honest - so many of us still want to move onto uni, public or private) JC kids - you all basically on holiday when expected to make an application.  2) As she mentioned - Open House AFTER our application. When I was NUS' Open Day, I went to the admissions booth to ask about something and there was an Indian father with his son from IB, also asking why is the Open House after their application. Yeah, you could say that we can still find out information on our own, call NUS to ask them about their programs if we are interested etc but aren't we just as much of an applicant and prospective student as the JC kids are... But truth is that they are still looking to recruit JC kids that's why the Open Day is so conveniently dated after their A'Level results are released. (P.S.: IB even earlier, apply in Jan) 3) Considering us based on 4 or 5 sems - NTU considered only my 4-semesters worth of results when making an offer as I could only submit 4-sems at the point of application. I am now appealing to my first choice but as all of us here know, chances are very slim. So my question is - why can't they hold onto their decisions and decide with my full cert? My final sem results literally is my entire year 3 modules because 5th sem roll over to the final sem due to FYP judging. Their explanation is for those with 5 sems, usually not much of a diff by the time 6th sem come, which I agree to some extent, but I believe if the student manage to pull up his grades enough to qualify him for the course he wants, it is doing disservice to his efforts. It is like making a decision based on your prelim results for A'Level kids. I am not complaining about how the odds are against us to begin with. I am just asking for the universities to see all applicants as equal, and given an equally fair shot at being considered.

And my GPA is obviously higher than quite alot of JC/IB students in SMU, even though I'm from Poly. At the end of the day, stop whining and crying over where you came from. Whether you came from a non-privileged or privileged background, if you did not get a spot in a Local Uni you only have yourself to blame because you did not work hard enough during 'A' levels or Poly.  And Poly students, you know fully well that more spots are allocated to JC students. It's a fact. Move on with it. You know that only the top 10 - 15% of the Poly cohort gets Local Uni admissions. So what if it's not equal, the government has been pushing for an increase in no. of spots allocated to Poly students.  And so what if it's not equal? Being the top 10-15% in poly shows your immense pedigree. Same logic goes to applying for Ivy Leagues with acceptance rates of 1%, you gonna complain to them to ask them to increase their acceptance rate? Or you going to work hard to be part of that 1%? Get over it.  And don't even talk about difference in opportunities because even I wasn't born with a silver spoon myself. Wherever you come from, work hard and succeed.

I'm actually currently an ITE (going to be graduating soon) student that's looking on to which polytechnics I should advance on and then subsequently, I intend on going to Uni to do a degree. While I think the PBL-pedagogy is great I would prefer something old school perhaps like at SP, NYP or maybe even NP. I would be okay with joining any of their generalised Business Diplomas, but because my lecturers here at ITE have been telling me to go to RP supposedly ("for increased chances to get top student and go to Uni") hence that was where I was going with my original question on RP students who are mainly from R48, R52- what were their odds on advancing to University. Ultimately, I do not want to jeopardise my chances of getting to Uni if I go to RP, because I think even tho there are some benefits about PBL- the Big3 Unis still have some doubts & stigma about the learning style there at RP. At least that's what I heard when I talked to my lecturers.  Idk about you but I feel RP's Business or "Management" courses feels really lackluster in terms of what they cover unlike other Polys which offer dual specialisation options. Some of these which one can maybe even use in Uni? I would love to hear your thoughts.

A person's status as a matriculated student will cease when he completes his study and is conferred his degree, or if he opts to withdraw from his study, or when his candidature is terminated by the University.

Actually I have been reading the past few years' threads as well only to realise how I must really buck up on my GPA and thanks to the realisation of how difficult it is to get into uni, I eventually managed to pull up my grades, with lots of stress of course.  Would like to contribute what I can:  Local, CPGA 3.64, 4 sem GPA 3.53, LIR4 10? or 12? Can't really remember.  Applied to:  NUS FASS - application STILL processing NTU HSS - offered third choice Linguistics based on 4 sems, will appeal for PPGA or Sociology  SMU Social Science - application STILL processing  For those wondering, I could only apply with my 4 semesters as my internship was on my 5th semester, so no 5th sem results. For NUS and SMU, they have made it clear to me at the many times I asked that they will not be making a decision based on 4 semesters if I don't meet the cut-off and will wait for the full transcript. As for NTU, their policy is to process with 4 semesters anyway and will make decision based on it.  Thankfully, my 4-semesters GPA somehow got me an interview with Linguistics. I was called up in early April, went for the writing test and interview, and got offered 2 days after my interview. When I went, two girls I spoke to both did not put Linguistics as their first choice. I believe most in the room (about 7 of us) possibly also did not do so and they were processing applications pushed down from other courses.  Just like to ask a few things I didn't see answers for despite stalking this thread quite religiously:  1) Those who got rejected - you guys got explicit rejection letters via email?  2) Those who got FASS interview and writing test - may I know what is it about? I am still hoping to DA into FASS but up till now no calls, pretty much nothing.  3) For the NTU appeal, should I write about how I have improved a lot and actually qualify for both PPGA and Soci with my 6-sems or focus on why I want to tranfer into these courses instead? Also, do you appeal specifically into one course or do they just assume you are appealing for whatever courses you didn't get?  4) Anyone applied for CAPT and have gone for the interview already?  As for DA: I did not have a CCA in school but I actively volunteered outside of school and did take on one very big role in one of the biggest community events in SG. Its way above the average amount that students would volunteer so I am hopeful yet at the same time not expectant. Have not seen a case of someone admitted via DA for community service.  I do think that my application remains processing for both NUS and SMU due to the fact that I am very borderline plus my DA is via community service. They have much better applicants to offer to but I am just praying very hard that at the end of this waiting game is good news.  Some other info that may help:  SMU is appearing to be very generous with their Biz Ad interviews this year as I know 3 people with GPAs ranging from 3.5-3.6 being offered interviews, aka already one step in if they don't screw up the interview. Could help that they come from related courses but I hope this give others in the same shoe some hope! No news is good news!  Cheers everybody! I like the positive vibes going on for the NTU appeals. Hope everybody eventually get to where they belong! ",13.626150825437827

What she is trying to say is that the entire admissions process, even with the grades required, is skewed towards the JC kids.  Some examples: 1) Poly application window is in Feb, basically when we are busiest with our last projects in poly life (poly kids will know this as hell week), we still have to complete our application. I am not sure if it applies to every JC, but I know some JC provide guidance to their students in writing their personal statement if required. Poly - I tried to ask for help, but no one could help me lol. I even went for further ed/career guidance counselling but it seems that I know the facts and the competitiveness better than the counselor. So yes, poly is expecting poly kids to go out and work after poly. (But let's be honest - so many of us still want to move onto uni, public or private) JC kids - you all basically on holiday when expected to make an application.  2) As she mentioned - Open House AFTER our application. When I was NUS' Open Day, I went to the admissions booth to ask about something and there was an Indian father with his son from IB, also asking why is the Open House after their application. Yeah, you could say that we can still find out information on our own, call NUS to ask them about their programs if we are interested etc but aren't we just as much of an applicant and prospective student as the JC kids are... But truth is that they are still looking to recruit JC kids that's why the Open Day is so conveniently dated after their A'Level results are released. (P.S.: IB even earlier, apply in Jan) 3) Considering us based on 4 or 5 sems - NTU considered only my 4-semesters worth of results when making an offer as I could only submit 4-sems at the point of application. I am now appealing to my first choice but as all of us here know, chances are very slim. So my question is - why can't they hold onto their decisions and decide with my full cert? My final sem results literally is my entire year 3 modules because 5th sem roll over to the final sem due to FYP judging. Their explanation is for those with 5 sems, usually not much of a diff by the time 6th sem come, which I agree to some extent, but I believe if the student manage to pull up his grades enough to qualify him for the course he wants, it is doing disservice to his efforts. It is like making a decision based on your prelim results for A'Level kids. I am not complaining about how the odds are against us to begin with. I am just asking for the universities to see all applicants as equal, and given an equally fair shot at being considered. Sorry for the long wall of text - I just want to give you guys some context, which I don't think JC kids would know if not.  ((Tbh, poly kids if you all don't have a preference, there are several engineering is not that hard to go in if you don't mind. GPA 3.4? 3.5? to safely secure a place. 3.4/3.5 should be manageable if you don't slack off too much and put in effort for your assignment/projects, and study for your exams.)) Guys stop arguing here. You just need to work hard whichever path you take that's all.  For myself, I went to Poly, achieved CGPA 3.99/4.00. Doing a SMU Double Degree in Business & Accountancy now and my CGPA is 3.90/4.00 - which is Summa Cum Laude, First Class Honours. And my GPA is obviously higher than quite alot of JC/IB students in SMU, even though I'm from Poly. At the end of the day, stop whining and crying over where you came from. Whether you came from a non-privileged or privileged background, if you did not get a spot in a Local Uni you only have yourself to blame because you did not work hard enough during 'A' levels or Poly.  And Poly students, you know fully well that more spots are allocated to JC students. It's a fact. Move on with it. You know that only the top 10 - 15% of the Poly cohort gets Local Uni admissions. So what if it's not equal, the government has been pushing for an increase in no. of spots allocated to Poly students.  And so what if it's not equal? Being the top 10-15% in poly shows your immense pedigree. Same logic goes to applying for Ivy Leagues with acceptance rates of 1%, you gonna complain to them to ask them to increase their acceptance rate? Or you going to work hard to be part of that 1%? Get over it.  And don't even talk about difference in opportunities because even I wasn't born with a silver spoon myself. Wherever you come from, work hard and succeed.

I'm actually currently an ITE (going to be graduating soon) student that's looking on to which polytechnics I should advance on and then subsequently, I intend on going to Uni to do a degree. While I think the PBL-pedagogy is great I would prefer something old school perhaps like at SP, NYP or maybe even NP. I would be okay with joining any of their generalised Business Diplomas, but because my lecturers here at ITE have been telling me to go to RP supposedly ("for increased chances to get top student and go to Uni") hence that was where I was going with my original question on RP students who are mainly from R48, R52- what were their odds on advancing to University. Ultimately, I do not want to jeopardise my chances of getting to Uni if I go to RP, because I think even tho there are some benefits about PBL- the Big3 Unis still have some doubts & stigma about the learning style there at RP. At least that's what I heard when I talked to my lecturers.  Idk about you but I feel RP's Business or "Management" courses feels really lackluster in terms of what they cover unlike other Polys which offer dual specialisation options. Some of these which one can maybe even use in Uni? I would love to hear your thoughts.

All students enrolling in NTU academic programmes that lead to the award of a degree must matriculate with the University before commencing their studies. A person's status as a matriculated student will cease when he completes his study and is conferred his degree, or if he opts to withdraw from his study, or when his candidature is terminated by the University.

2017,Singapore Management University|smu,Nanyang Junior College|nanyang jc|nyjc|computer|com|infosys|information systems|analytics,"Hi all,  Signing up for an account and posting for the first time as this thread has given me a lot of information and insight into the whole application process.  Actually I have been reading the past few years' threads as well only to realise how I must really buck up on my GPA and thanks to the realisation of how difficult it is to get into uni, I eventually managed to pull up my grades, with lots of stress of course.  Would like to contribute what I can:  Local, CPGA 3.64, 4 sem GPA 3.53, LIR4 10? or 12? Can't really remember.  Applied to:  NUS FASS - application STILL processing NTU HSS - offered third choice Linguistics based on 4 sems, will appeal for PPGA or Sociology  SMU Social Science - application STILL processing  For those wondering, I could only apply with my 4 semesters as my internship was on my 5th semester, so no 5th sem results. For NUS and SMU, they have made it clear to me at the many times I asked that they will not be making a decision based on 4 semesters if I don't meet the cut-off and will wait for the full transcript. As for NTU, their policy is to process with 4 semesters anyway and will make decision based on it.  Thankfully, my 4-semesters GPA somehow got me an interview with Linguistics. I was called up in early April, went for the writing test and interview, and got offered 2 days after my interview. When I went, two girls I spoke to both did not put Linguistics as their first choice. I believe most in the room (about 7 of us) possibly also did not do so and they were processing applications pushed down from other courses.  Just like to ask a few things I didn't see answers for despite stalking this thread quite religiously:  1) Those who got rejected - you guys got explicit rejection letters via email?  2) Those who got FASS interview and writing test - may I know what is it about? I am still hoping to DA into FASS but up till now no calls, pretty much nothing.  3) For the NTU appeal, should I write about how I have improved a lot and actually qualify for both PPGA and Soci with my 6-sems or focus on why I want to tranfer into these courses instead? Also, do you appeal specifically into one course or do they just assume you are appealing for whatever courses you didn't get?  4) Anyone applied for CAPT and have gone for the interview already?  As for DA: I did not have a CCA in school but I actively volunteered outside of school and did take on one very big role in one of the biggest community events in SG. Its way above the average amount that students would volunteer so I am hopeful yet at the same time not expectant. Have not seen a case of someone admitted via DA for community service.  I do think that my application remains processing for both NUS and SMU due to the fact that I am very borderline plus my DA is via community service. They have much better applicants to offer to but I am just praying very hard that at the end of this waiting game is good news.  Some other info that may help:  SMU is appearing to be very generous with their Biz Ad interviews this year as I know 3 people with GPAs ranging from 3.5-3.6 being offered interviews, aka already one step in if they don't screw up the interview. Could help that they come from related courses but I hope this give others in the same shoe some hope! No news is good news!  Cheers everybody! I like the positive vibes going on for the NTU appeals. Hope everybody eventually get to where they belong! ",13.626150825437827

What she is trying to say is that the entire admissions process, even with the grades required, is skewed towards the JC kids.  Some examples: 1) Poly application window is in Feb, basically when we are busiest with our last projects in poly life (poly kids will know this as hell week), we still have to complete our application. I am not sure if it applies to every JC, but I know some JC provide guidance to their students in writing their personal statement if required. Poly - I tried to ask for help, but no one could help me lol. I even went for further ed/career guidance counselling but it seems that I know the facts and the competitiveness better than the counselor. So yes, poly is expecting poly kids to go out and work after poly. (But let's be honest - so many of us still want to move onto uni, public or private) JC kids - you all basically on holiday when expected to make an application.  2) As she mentioned - Open House AFTER our application. When I was NUS' Open Day, I went to the admissions booth to ask about something and there was an Indian father with his son from IB, also asking why is the Open House after their application. Yeah, you could say that we can still find out information on our own, call NUS to ask them about their programs if we are interested etc but aren't we just as much of an applicant and prospective student as the JC kids are... But truth is that they are still looking to recruit JC kids that's why the Open Day is so conveniently dated after their A'Level results are released. (P.S.: IB even earlier, apply in Jan) 3) Considering us based on 4 or 5 sems - NTU considered only my 4-semesters worth of results when making an offer as I could only submit 4-sems at the point of application. I am now appealing to my first choice but as all of us here know, chances are very slim. So my question is - why can't they hold onto their decisions and decide with my full cert? My final sem results literally is my entire year 3 modules because 5th sem roll over to the final sem due to FYP judging. Their explanation is for those with 5 sems, usually not much of a diff by the time 6th sem come, which I agree to some extent, but I believe if the student manage to pull up his grades enough to qualify him for the course he wants, it is doing disservice to his efforts. It is like making a decision based on your prelim results for A'Level kids. I am not complaining about how the odds are against us to begin with. I am just asking for the universities to see all applicants as equal, and given an equally fair shot at being considered. Sorry for the long wall of text - I just want to give you guys some context, which I don't think JC kids would know if not.  ((Tbh, poly kids if you all don't have a preference, there are several engineering is not that hard to go in if you don't mind. GPA 3.4? 3.5? to safely secure a place. 3.4/3.5 should be manageable if you don't slack off too much and put in effort for your assignment/projects, and study for your exams.)) Guys stop arguing here. You just need to work hard whichever path you take that's all.  For myself, I went to Poly, achieved CGPA 3.99/4.00. Doing a SMU Double Degree in Business & Accountancy now and my CGPA is 3.90/4.00 - which is Summa Cum Laude, First Class Honours. And my GPA is obviously higher than quite alot of JC/IB students in SMU, even though I'm from Poly. At the end of the day, stop whining and crying over where you came from. Whether you came from a non-privileged or privileged background, if you did not get a spot in a Local Uni you only have yourself to blame because you did not work hard enough during 'A' levels or Poly.  And Poly students, you know fully well that more spots are allocated to JC students. It's a fact. Move on with it. You know that only the top 10 - 15% of the Poly cohort gets Local Uni admissions. So what if it's not equal, the government has been pushing for an increase in no. of spots allocated to Poly students.  And so what if it's not equal? Being the top 10-15% in poly shows your immense pedigree. Same logic goes to applying for Ivy Leagues with acceptance rates of 1%, you gonna complain to them to ask them to increase their acceptance rate? Or you going to work hard to be part of that 1%? Get over it.  And don't even talk about difference in opportunities because even I wasn't born with a silver spoon myself. Wherever you come from, work hard and succeed.

I'm actually currently an ITE (going to be graduating soon) student that's looking on to which polytechnics I should advance on and then subsequently, I intend on going to Uni to do a degree. While I think the PBL-pedagogy is great I would prefer something old school perhaps like at SP, NYP or maybe even NP. I would be okay with joining any of their generalised Business Diplomas, but because my lecturers here at ITE have been telling me to go to RP supposedly ("for increased chances to get top student and go to Uni") hence that was where I was going with my original question on RP students who are mainly from R48, R52- what were their odds on advancing to University. Ultimately, I do not want to jeopardise my chances of getting to Uni if I go to RP, because I think even tho there are some benefits about PBL- the Big3 Unis still have some doubts & stigma about the learning style there at RP. At least that's what I heard when I talked to my lecturers.  Idk about you but I feel RP's Business or "Management" courses feels really lackluster in terms of what they cover unlike other Polys which offer dual specialisation options. Some of these which one can maybe even use in Uni? I would love to hear your thoughts.

2017,Singapore Management University|smu,National Junior College|national jc|njc|computer|com|infosys|information systems|analytics,"Hi all,  Signing up for an account and posting for the first time as this thread has given me a lot of information and insight into the whole application process.  Actually I have been reading the past few years' threads as well only to realise how I must really buck up on my GPA and thanks to the realisation of how difficult it is to get into uni, I eventually managed to pull up my grades, with lots of stress of course.  Would like to contribute what I can:  Local, CPGA 3.64, 4 sem GPA 3.53, LIR4 10? or 12? Can't really remember.  Applied to:  NUS FASS - application STILL processing NTU HSS - offered third choice Linguistics based on 4 sems, will appeal for PPGA or Sociology  SMU Social Science - application STILL processing  For those wondering, I could only apply with my 4 semesters as my internship was on my 5th semester, so no 5th sem results. For NUS and SMU, they have made it clear to me at the many times I asked that they will not be making a decision based on 4 semesters if I don't meet the cut-off and will wait for the full transcript. As for NTU, their policy is to process with 4 semesters anyway and will make decision based on it.  Thankfully, my 4-semesters GPA somehow got me an interview with Linguistics. I was called up in early April, went for the writing test and interview, and got offered 2 days after my interview. When I went, two girls I spoke to both did not put Linguistics as their first choice. I believe most in the room (about 7 of us) possibly also did not do so and they were processing applications pushed down from other courses.  Just like to ask a few things I didn't see answers for despite stalking this thread quite religiously:  1) Those who got rejected - you guys got explicit rejection letters via email?  2) Those who got FASS interview and writing test - may I know what is it about? I am still hoping to DA into FASS but up till now no calls, pretty much nothing.  3) For the NTU appeal, should I write about how I have improved a lot and actually qualify for both PPGA and Soci with my 6-sems or focus on why I want to tranfer into these courses instead? Also, do you appeal specifically into one course or do they just assume you are appealing for whatever courses you didn't get?  4) Anyone applied for CAPT and have gone for the interview already?  As for DA: I did not have a CCA in school but I actively volunteered outside of school and did take on one very big role in one of the biggest community events in SG. Its way above the average amount that students would volunteer so I am hopeful yet at the same time not expectant. Have not seen a case of someone admitted via DA for community service.  I do think that my application remains processing for both NUS and SMU due to the fact that I am very borderline plus my DA is via community service. They have much better applicants to offer to but I am just praying very hard that at the end of this waiting game is good news.  Some other info that may help:  SMU is appearing to be very generous with their Biz Ad interviews this year as I know 3 people with GPAs ranging from 3.5-3.6 being offered interviews, aka already one step in if they don't screw up the interview. Could help that they come from related courses but I hope this give others in the same shoe some hope! No news is good news!  Cheers everybody! I like the positive vibes going on for the NTU appeals. Hope everybody eventually get to where they belong! ",13.626150825437827

What she is trying to say is that the entire admissions process, even with the grades required, is skewed towards the JC kids.  Some examples: 1) Poly application window is in Feb, basically when we are busiest with our last projects in poly life (poly kids will know this as hell week), we still have to complete our application. I am not sure if it applies to every JC, but I know some JC provide guidance to their students in writing their personal statement if required. Poly - I tried to ask for help, but no one could help me lol. I even went for further ed/career guidance counselling but it seems that I know the facts and the competitiveness better than the counselor. So yes, poly is expecting poly kids to go out and work after poly. (But let's be honest - so many of us still want to move onto uni, public or private) JC kids - you all basically on holiday when expected to make an application.  2) As she mentioned - Open House AFTER our application. When I was NUS' Open Day, I went to the admissions booth to ask about something and there was an Indian father with his son from IB, also asking why is the Open House after their application. Yeah, you could say that we can still find out information on our own, call NUS to ask them about their programs if we are interested etc but aren't we just as much of an applicant and prospective student as the JC kids are... But truth is that they are still looking to recruit JC kids that's why the Open Day is so conveniently dated after their A'Level results are released. (P.S.: IB even earlier, apply in Jan) 3) Considering us based on 4 or 5 sems - NTU considered only my 4-semesters worth of results when making an offer as I could only submit 4-sems at the point of application. I am now appealing to my first choice but as all of us here know, chances are very slim. So my question is - why can't they hold onto their decisions and decide with my full cert? My final sem results literally is my entire year 3 modules because 5th sem roll over to the final sem due to FYP judging. Their explanation is for those with 5 sems, usually not much of a diff by the time 6th sem come, which I agree to some extent, but I believe if the student manage to pull up his grades enough to qualify him for the course he wants, it is doing disservice to his efforts. It is like making a decision based on your prelim results for A'Level kids. I am not complaining about how the odds are against us to begin with. I am just asking for the universities to see all applicants as equal, and given an equally fair shot at being considered. Sorry for the long wall of text - I just want to give you guys some context, which I don't think JC kids would know if not.  ((Tbh, poly kids if you all don't have a preference, there are several engineering is not that hard to go in if you don't mind. GPA 3.4? 3.5? to safely secure a place. 3.4/3.5 should be manageable if you don't slack off too much and put in effort for your assignment/projects, and study for your exams.)) Guys stop arguing here. You just need to work hard whichever path you take that's all.  For myself, I went to Poly, achieved CGPA 3.99/4.00. Doing a SMU Double Degree in Business & Accountancy now and my CGPA is 3.90/4.00 - which is Summa Cum Laude, First Class Honours. And my GPA is obviously higher than quite alot of JC/IB students in SMU, even though I'm from Poly. At the end of the day, stop whining and crying over where you came from. Whether you came from a non-privileged or privileged background, if you did not get a spot in a Local Uni you only have yourself to blame because you did not work hard enough during 'A' levels or Poly.  And Poly students, you know fully well that more spots are allocated to JC students. It's a fact. Move on with it. You know that only the top 10 - 15% of the Poly cohort gets Local Uni admissions. So what if it's not equal, the government has been pushing for an increase in no. of spots allocated to Poly students.  And so what if it's not equal? Being the top 10-15% in poly shows your immense pedigree.

I'm actually currently an ITE (going to be graduating soon) student that's looking on to which polytechnics I should advance on and then subsequently, I intend on going to Uni to do a degree. While I think the PBL-pedagogy is great I would prefer something old school perhaps like at SP, NYP or maybe even NP. I would be okay with joining any of their generalised Business Diplomas, but because my lecturers here at ITE have been telling me to go to RP supposedly ("for increased chances to get top student and go to Uni") hence that was where I was going with my original question on RP students who are mainly from R48, R52- what were their odds on advancing to University. Ultimately, I do not want to jeopardise my chances of getting to Uni if I go to RP, because I think even tho there are some benefits about PBL- the Big3 Unis still have some doubts & stigma about the learning style there at RP. At least that's what I heard when I talked to my lecturers.  Idk about you but I feel RP's Business or "Management" courses feels really lackluster in terms of what they cover unlike other Polys which offer dual specialisation options. Some of these which one can maybe even use in Uni? I would love to hear your thoughts.

A person's status as a matriculated student will cease when he completes his study and is conferred his degree, or if he opts to withdraw from his study, or when his candidature is terminated by the University.

2017,Singapore Management University|smu,Raffles Junior College|raffles jc|rjc|computer|com|infosys|information systems|analytics,"Hi all,  Signing up for an account and posting for the first time as this thread has given me a lot of information and insight into the whole application process.  Actually I have been reading the past few years' threads as well only to realise how I must really buck up on my GPA and thanks to the realisation of how difficult it is to get into uni, I eventually managed to pull up my grades, with lots of stress of course.  Would like to contribute what I can:  Local, CPGA 3.64, 4 sem GPA 3.53, LIR4 10? or 12? Can't really remember.  Applied to:  NUS FASS - application STILL processing NTU HSS - offered third choice Linguistics based on 4 sems, will appeal for PPGA or Sociology  SMU Social Science - application STILL processing  For those wondering, I could only apply with my 4 semesters as my internship was on my 5th semester, so no 5th sem results. For NUS and SMU, they have made it clear to me at the many times I asked that they will not be making a decision based on 4 semesters if I don't meet the cut-off and will wait for the full transcript. As for NTU, their policy is to process with 4 semesters anyway and will make decision based on it.  Thankfully, my 4-semesters GPA somehow got me an interview with Linguistics. I was called up in early April, went for the writing test and interview, and got offered 2 days after my interview. When I went, two girls I spoke to both did not put Linguistics as their first choice. I believe most in the room (about 7 of us) possibly also did not do so and they were processing applications pushed down from other courses.  Just like to ask a few things I didn't see answers for despite stalking this thread quite religiously:  1) Those who got rejected - you guys got explicit rejection letters via email?  2) Those who got FASS interview and writing test - may I know what is it about? I am still hoping to DA into FASS but up till now no calls, pretty much nothing.  3) For the NTU appeal, should I write about how I have improved a lot and actually qualify for both PPGA and Soci with my 6-sems or focus on why I want to tranfer into these courses instead? Also, do you appeal specifically into one course or do they just assume you are appealing for whatever courses you didn't get?  4) Anyone applied for CAPT and have gone for the interview already?  As for DA: I did not have a CCA in school but I actively volunteered outside of school and did take on one very big role in one of the biggest community events in SG. Its way above the average amount that students would volunteer so I am hopeful yet at the same time not expectant. Have not seen a case of someone admitted via DA for community service.  I do think that my application remains processing for both NUS and SMU due to the fact that I am very borderline plus my DA is via community service. They have much better applicants to offer to but I am just praying very hard that at the end of this waiting game is good news.  Some other info that may help:  SMU is appearing to be very generous with their Biz Ad interviews this year as I know 3 people with GPAs ranging from 3.5-3.6 being offered interviews, aka already one step in if they don't screw up the interview. Could help that they come from related courses but I hope this give others in the same shoe some hope! No news is good news!  Cheers everybody! I like the positive vibes going on for the NTU appeals. Hope everybody eventually get to where they belong! ",13.626150825437827

What she is trying to say is that the entire admissions process, even with the grades required, is skewed towards the JC kids.  Some examples: 1) Poly application window is in Feb, basically when we are busiest with our last projects in poly life (poly kids will know this as hell week), we still have to complete our application. I am not sure if it applies to every JC, but I know some JC provide guidance to their students in writing their personal statement if required. Poly - I tried to ask for help, but no one could help me lol. I even went for further ed/career guidance counselling but it seems that I know the facts and the competitiveness better than the counselor. So yes, poly is expecting poly kids to go out and work after poly. (But let's be honest - so many of us still want to move onto uni, public or private) JC kids - you all basically on holiday when expected to make an application.  2) As she mentioned - Open House AFTER our application. When I was NUS' Open Day, I went to the admissions booth to ask about something and there was an Indian father with his son from IB, also asking why is the Open House after their application. Yeah, you could say that we can still find out information on our own, call NUS to ask them about their programs if we are interested etc but aren't we just as much of an applicant and prospective student as the JC kids are... But truth is that they are still looking to recruit JC kids that's why the Open Day is so conveniently dated after their A'Level results are released. (P.S.: IB even earlier, apply in Jan) 3) Considering us based on 4 or 5 sems - NTU considered only my 4-semesters worth of results when making an offer as I could only submit 4-sems at the point of application. I am now appealing to my first choice but as all of us here know, chances are very slim. So my question is - why can't they hold onto their decisions and decide with my full cert? My final sem results literally is my entire year 3 modules because 5th sem roll over to the final sem due to FYP judging. Their explanation is for those with 5 sems, usually not much of a diff by the time 6th sem come, which I agree to some extent, but I believe if the student manage to pull up his grades enough to qualify him for the course he wants, it is doing disservice to his efforts. It is like making a decision based on your prelim results for A'Level kids. I am not complaining about how the odds are against us to begin with. I am just asking for the universities to see all applicants as equal, and given an equally fair shot at being considered. Sorry for the long wall of text - I just want to give you guys some context, which I don't think JC kids would know if not.  ((Tbh, poly kids if you all don't have a preference, there are several engineering is not that hard to go in if you don't mind. GPA 3.4? 3.5? to safely secure a place. 3.4/3.5 should be manageable if you don't slack off too much and put in effort for your assignment/projects, and study for your exams.)) Guys stop arguing here. You just need to work hard whichever path you take that's all.  For myself, I went to Poly, achieved CGPA 3.99/4.00. Doing a SMU Double Degree in Business & Accountancy now and my CGPA is 3.90/4.00 - which is Summa Cum Laude, First Class Honours. And my GPA is obviously higher than quite alot of JC/IB students in SMU, even though I'm from Poly. At the end of the day, stop whining and crying over where you came from. Whether you came from a non-privileged or privileged background, if you did not get a spot in a Local Uni you only have yourself to blame because you did not work hard enough during 'A' levels or Poly.  And Poly students, you know fully well that more spots are allocated to JC students. It's a fact. Move on with it. You know that only the top 10 - 15% of the Poly cohort gets Local Uni admissions. So what if it's not equal, the government has been pushing for an increase in no. of spots allocated to Poly students.  And so what if it's not equal? Being the top 10-15% in poly shows your immense pedigree. Same logic goes to applying for Ivy Leagues with acceptance rates of 1%, you gonna complain to them to ask them to increase their acceptance rate? Or you going to work hard to be part of that 1%? Get over it.  And don't even talk about difference in opportunities because even I wasn't born with a silver spoon myself. Wherever you come from, work hard and succeed.

I'm actually currently an ITE (going to be graduating soon) student that's looking on to which polytechnics I should advance on and then subsequently, I intend on going to Uni to do a degree. While I think the PBL-pedagogy is great I would prefer something old school perhaps like at SP, NYP or maybe even NP. I would be okay with joining any of their generalised Business Diplomas, but because my lecturers here at ITE have been telling me to go to RP supposedly ("for increased chances to get top student and go to Uni") hence that was where I was going with my original question on RP students who are mainly from R48, R52- what were their odds on advancing to University. Ultimately, I do not want to jeopardise my chances of getting to Uni if I go to RP, because I think even tho there are some benefits about PBL- the Big3 Unis still have some doubts & stigma about the learning style there at RP. At least that's what I heard when I talked to my lecturers.  Idk about you but I feel RP's Business or "Management" courses feels really lackluster in terms of what they cover unlike other Polys which offer dual specialisation options. Some of these which one can maybe even use in Uni? I would love to hear your thoughts.

All students enrolling in NTU academic programmes that lead to the award of a degree must matriculate with the University before commencing their studies. A person's status as a matriculated student will cease when he completes his study and is conferred his degree, or if he opts to withdraw from his study, or when his candidature is terminated by the University.

2017,Singapore Management University|smu,Saint Andrew's Junior College|saint andrews junior college|saint andrews jc|sajc|computer|com|infosys|information systems|analytics,"Hi all,  Signing up for an account and posting for the first time as this thread has given me a lot of information and insight into the whole application process.  Actually I have been reading the past few years' threads as well only to realise how I must really buck up on my GPA and thanks to the realisation of how difficult it is to get into uni, I eventually managed to pull up my grades, with lots of stress of course.  Would like to contribute what I can:  Local, CPGA 3.64, 4 sem GPA 3.53, LIR4 10? or 12? Can't really remember.  Applied to:  NUS FASS - application STILL processing NTU HSS - offered third choice Linguistics based on 4 sems, will appeal for PPGA or Sociology  SMU Social Science - application STILL processing  For those wondering, I could only apply with my 4 semesters as my internship was on my 5th semester, so no 5th sem results. For NUS and SMU, they have made it clear to me at the many times I asked that they will not be making a decision based on 4 semesters if I don't meet the cut-off and will wait for the full transcript. As for NTU, their policy is to process with 4 semesters anyway and will make decision based on it.  Thankfully, my 4-semesters GPA somehow got me an interview with Linguistics. I was called up in early April, went for the writing test and interview, and got offered 2 days after my interview. When I went, two girls I spoke to both did not put Linguistics as their first choice. I believe most in the room (about 7 of us) possibly also did not do so and they were processing applications pushed down from other courses.  Just like to ask a few things I didn't see answers for despite stalking this thread quite religiously:  1) Those who got rejected - you guys got explicit rejection letters via email?  2) Those who got FASS interview and writing test - may I know what is it about? I am still hoping to DA into FASS but up till now no calls, pretty much nothing.  3) For the NTU appeal, should I write about how I have improved a lot and actually qualify for both PPGA and Soci with my 6-sems or focus on why I want to tranfer into these courses instead? Also, do you appeal specifically into one course or do they just assume you are appealing for whatever courses you didn't get?  4) Anyone applied for CAPT and have gone for the interview already?  As for DA: I did not have a CCA in school but I actively volunteered outside of school and did take on one very big role in one of the biggest community events in SG. Its way above the average amount that students would volunteer so I am hopeful yet at the same time not expectant. Have not seen a case of someone admitted via DA for community service.  I do think that my application remains processing for both NUS and SMU due to the fact that I am very borderline plus my DA is via community service. They have much better applicants to offer to but I am just praying very hard that at the end of this waiting game is good news.  Some other info that may help:  SMU is appearing to be very generous with their Biz Ad interviews this year as I know 3 people with GPAs ranging from 3.5-3.6 being offered interviews, aka already one step in if they don't screw up the interview. Could help that they come from related courses but I hope this give others in the same shoe some hope! No news is good news!  Cheers everybody! I like the positive vibes going on for the NTU appeals. Hope everybody eventually get to where they belong! ",13.626150825437827

What she is trying to say is that the entire admissions process, even with the grades required, is skewed towards the JC kids.  Some examples: 1) Poly application window is in Feb, basically when we are busiest with our last projects in poly life (poly kids will know this as hell week), we still have to complete our application. I am not sure if it applies to every JC, but I know some JC provide guidance to their students in writing their personal statement if required. Poly - I tried to ask for help, but no one could help me lol. I even went for further ed/career guidance counselling but it seems that I know the facts and the competitiveness better than the counselor. So yes, poly is expecting poly kids to go out and work after poly. (But let's be honest - so many of us still want to move onto uni, public or private) JC kids - you all basically on holiday when expected to make an application.  2) As she mentioned - Open House AFTER our application. When I was NUS' Open Day, I went to the admissions booth to ask about something and there was an Indian father with his son from IB, also asking why is the Open House after their application. Yeah, you could say that we can still find out information on our own, call NUS to ask them about their programs if we are interested etc but aren't we just as much of an applicant and prospective student as the JC kids are... But truth is that they are still looking to recruit JC kids that's why the Open Day is so conveniently dated after their A'Level results are released. (P.S.: IB even earlier, apply in Jan) 3) Considering us based on 4 or 5 sems - NTU considered only my 4-semesters worth of results when making an offer as I could only submit 4-sems at the point of application. I am now appealing to my first choice but as all of us here know, chances are very slim. So my question is - why can't they hold onto their decisions and decide with my full cert? My final sem results literally is my entire year 3 modules because 5th sem roll over to the final sem due to FYP judging. Their explanation is for those with 5 sems, usually not much of a diff by the time 6th sem come, which I agree to some extent, but I believe if the student manage to pull up his grades enough to qualify him for the course he wants, it is doing disservice to his efforts. It is like making a decision based on your prelim results for A'Level kids. I am not complaining about how the odds are against us to begin with. I am just asking for the universities to see all applicants as equal, and given an equally fair shot at being considered. Sorry for the long wall of text - I just want to give you guys some context, which I don't think JC kids would know if not.  ((Tbh, poly kids if you all don't have a preference, there are several engineering is not that hard to go in if you don't mind. GPA 3.4? 3.5? to safely secure a place. 3.4/3.5 should be manageable if you don't slack off too much and put in effort for your assignment/projects, and study for your exams.)) Guys stop arguing here. You just need to work hard whichever path you take that's all.  For myself, I went to Poly, achieved CGPA 3.99/4.00. Doing a SMU Double Degree in Business & Accountancy now and my CGPA is 3.90/4.00 - which is Summa Cum Laude, First Class Honours. And my GPA is obviously higher than quite alot of JC/IB students in SMU, even though I'm from Poly. At the end of the day, stop whining and crying over where you came from. Whether you came from a non-privileged or privileged background, if you did not get a spot in a Local Uni you only have yourself to blame because you did not work hard enough during 'A' levels or Poly.  And Poly students, you know fully well that more spots are allocated to JC students. It's a fact. Move on with it. You know that only the top 10 - 15% of the Poly cohort gets Local Uni admissions. So what if it's not equal, the government has been pushing for an increase in no. of spots allocated to Poly students.  And so what if it's not equal? Being the top 10-15% in poly shows your immense pedigree. Same logic goes to applying for Ivy Leagues with acceptance rates of 1%, you gonna complain to them to ask them to increase their acceptance rate? Or you going to work hard to be part of that 1%? Get over it.  And don't even talk about difference in opportunities because even I wasn't born with a silver spoon myself. Wherever you come from, work hard and succeed.

I'm actually currently an ITE (going to be graduating soon) student that's looking on to which polytechnics I should advance on and then subsequently, I intend on going to Uni to do a degree. While I think the PBL-pedagogy is great I would prefer something old school perhaps like at SP, NYP or maybe even NP. I would be okay with joining any of their generalised Business Diplomas, but because my lecturers here at ITE have been telling me to go to RP supposedly ("for increased chances to get top student and go to Uni") hence that was where I was going with my original question on RP students who are mainly from R48, R52- what were their odds on advancing to University. Ultimately, I do not want to jeopardise my chances of getting to Uni if I go to RP, because I think even tho there are some benefits about PBL- the Big3 Unis still have some doubts & stigma about the learning style there at RP. At least that's what I heard when I talked to my lecturers.  Idk about you but I feel RP's Business or "Management" courses feels really lackluster in terms of what they cover unlike other Polys which offer dual specialisation options. Some of these which one can maybe even use in Uni? I would love to hear your thoughts.

Instead, he now partnered another RP School of Management and Communication graduate to run a chain of 5 Mince Meat Noodle stalls at heartland kopitiams.

All students enrolling in NTU academic programmes that lead to the award of a degree must matriculate with the University before commencing their studies. A person's status as a matriculated student will cease when he completes his study and is conferred his degree, or if he opts to withdraw from his study, or when his candidature is terminated by the University.

2017,Singapore Management University|smu,St. Joseph's Institution|sji|computer|com|infosys|information systems|analytics,"Hi all,  Signing up for an account and posting for the first time as this thread has given me a lot of information and insight into the whole application process.  Actually I have been reading the past few years' threads as well only to realise how I must really buck up on my GPA and thanks to the realisation of how difficult it is to get into uni, I eventually managed to pull up my grades, with lots of stress of course.  Would like to contribute what I can:  Local, CPGA 3.64, 4 sem GPA 3.53, LIR4 10? or 12? Can't really remember.  Applied to:  NUS FASS - application STILL processing NTU HSS - offered third choice Linguistics based on 4 sems, will appeal for PPGA or Sociology  SMU Social Science - application STILL processing  For those wondering, I could only apply with my 4 semesters as my internship was on my 5th semester, so no 5th sem results. For NUS and SMU, they have made it clear to me at the many times I asked that they will not be making a decision based on 4 semesters if I don't meet the cut-off and will wait for the full transcript. As for NTU, their policy is to process with 4 semesters anyway and will make decision based on it.  Thankfully, my 4-semesters GPA somehow got me an interview with Linguistics. I was called up in early April, went for the writing test and interview, and got offered 2 days after my interview. When I went, two girls I spoke to both did not put Linguistics as their first choice. I believe most in the room (about 7 of us) possibly also did not do so and they were processing applications pushed down from other courses.  Just like to ask a few things I didn't see answers for despite stalking this thread quite religiously:  1) Those who got rejected - you guys got explicit rejection letters via email?  2) Those who got FASS interview and writing test - may I know what is it about? I am still hoping to DA into FASS but up till now no calls, pretty much nothing.  3) For the NTU appeal, should I write about how I have improved a lot and actually qualify for both PPGA and Soci with my 6-sems or focus on why I want to tranfer into these courses instead? Also, do you appeal specifically into one course or do they just assume you are appealing for whatever courses you didn't get?  4) Anyone applied for CAPT and have gone for the interview already?  As for DA: I did not have a CCA in school but I actively volunteered outside of school and did take on one very big role in one of the biggest community events in SG. Its way above the average amount that students would volunteer so I am hopeful yet at the same time not expectant. Have not seen a case of someone admitted via DA for community service.  I do think that my application remains processing for both NUS and SMU due to the fact that I am very borderline plus my DA is via community service. They have much better applicants to offer to but I am just praying very hard that at the end of this waiting game is good news.  Some other info that may help:  SMU is appearing to be very generous with their Biz Ad interviews this year as I know 3 people with GPAs ranging from 3.5-3.6 being offered interviews, aka already one step in if they don't screw up the interview. Could help that they come from related courses but I hope this give others in the same shoe some hope! No news is good news!  Cheers everybody! I like the positive vibes going on for the NTU appeals. Hope everybody eventually get to where they belong! ",13.626150825437827

What she is trying to say is that the entire admissions process, even with the grades required, is skewed towards the JC kids.  Some examples: 1) Poly application window is in Feb, basically when we are busiest with our last projects in poly life (poly kids will know this as hell week), we still have to complete our application. I am not sure if it applies to every JC, but I know some JC provide guidance to their students in writing their personal statement if required. Poly - I tried to ask for help, but no one could help me lol. I even went for further ed/career guidance counselling but it seems that I know the facts and the competitiveness better than the counselor. So yes, poly is expecting poly kids to go out and work after poly. (But let's be honest - so many of us still want to move onto uni, public or private) JC kids - you all basically on holiday when expected to make an application.  2) As she mentioned - Open House AFTER our application. When I was NUS' Open Day, I went to the admissions booth to ask about something and there was an Indian father with his son from IB, also asking why is the Open House after their application. Yeah, you could say that we can still find out information on our own, call NUS to ask them about their programs if we are interested etc but aren't we just as much of an applicant and prospective student as the JC kids are... But truth is that they are still looking to recruit JC kids that's why the Open Day is so conveniently dated after their A'Level results are released. (P.S.: IB even earlier, apply in Jan) 3) Considering us based on 4 or 5 sems - NTU considered only my 4-semesters worth of results when making an offer as I could only submit 4-sems at the point of application. I am now appealing to my first choice but as all of us here know, chances are very slim. So my question is - why can't they hold onto their decisions and decide with my full cert? My final sem results literally is my entire year 3 modules because 5th sem roll over to the final sem due to FYP judging. Their explanation is for those with 5 sems, usually not much of a diff by the time 6th sem come, which I agree to some extent, but I believe if the student manage to pull up his grades enough to qualify him for the course he wants, it is doing disservice to his efforts. It is like making a decision based on your prelim results for A'Level kids. I am not complaining about how the odds are against us to begin with. I am just asking for the universities to see all applicants as equal, and given an equally fair shot at being considered. Sorry for the long wall of text - I just want to give you guys some context, which I don't think JC kids would know if not.  ((Tbh, poly kids if you all don't have a preference, there are several engineering is not that hard to go in if you don't mind. GPA 3.4? 3.5? to safely secure a place. 3.4/3.5 should be manageable if you don't slack off too much and put in effort for your assignment/projects, and study for your exams.)) Guys stop arguing here. You just need to work hard whichever path you take that's all.  For myself, I went to Poly, achieved CGPA 3.99/4.00. Doing a SMU Double Degree in Business & Accountancy now and my CGPA is 3.90/4.00 - which is Summa Cum Laude, First Class Honours. And my GPA is obviously higher than quite alot of JC/IB students in SMU, even though I'm from Poly. At the end of the day, stop whining and crying over where you came from. Whether you came from a non-privileged or privileged background, if you did not get a spot in a Local Uni you only have yourself to blame because you did not work hard enough during 'A' levels or Poly.  And Poly students, you know fully well that more spots are allocated to JC students. It's a fact. Move on with it. You know that only the top 10 - 15% of the Poly cohort gets Local Uni admissions. So what if it's not equal, the government has been pushing for an increase in no. of spots allocated to Poly students.  And so what if it's not equal? Being the top 10-15% in poly shows your immense pedigree. Same logic goes to applying for Ivy Leagues with acceptance rates of 1%, you gonna complain to them to ask them to increase their acceptance rate? Or you going to work hard to be part of that 1%? Get over it.  And don't even talk about difference in opportunities because even I wasn't born with a silver spoon myself. Wherever you come from, work hard and succeed.

I'm actually currently an ITE (going to be graduating soon) student that's looking on to which polytechnics I should advance on and then subsequently, I intend on going to Uni to do a degree. While I think the PBL-pedagogy is great I would prefer something old school perhaps like at SP, NYP or maybe even NP. I would be okay with joining any of their generalised Business Diplomas, but because my lecturers here at ITE have been telling me to go to RP supposedly ("for increased chances to get top student and go to Uni") hence that was where I was going with my original question on RP students who are mainly from R48, R52- what were their odds on advancing to University. Ultimately, I do not want to jeopardise my chances of getting to Uni if I go to RP, because I think even tho there are some benefits about PBL- the Big3 Unis still have some doubts & stigma about the learning style there at RP. At least that's what I heard when I talked to my lecturers.  Idk about you but I feel RP's Business or "Management" courses feels really lackluster in terms of what they cover unlike other Polys which offer dual specialisation options. Some of these which one can maybe even use in Uni? I would love to hear your thoughts.

Instead, he now partnered another RP School of Management and Communication graduate to run a chain of 5 Mince Meat Noodle stalls at heartland kopitiams.

All students enrolling in NTU academic programmes that lead to the award of a degree must matriculate with the University before commencing their studies. A person's status as a matriculated student will cease when he completes his study and is conferred his degree, or if he opts to withdraw from his study, or when his candidature is terminated by the University. Matriculation carries with it the agreement to abide by University rules and regulations, and codes of conduct.

Actually I have been reading the past few years' threads as well only to realise how I must really buck up on my GPA and thanks to the realisation of how difficult it is to get into uni, I eventually managed to pull up my grades, with lots of stress of course.  Would like to contribute what I can:  Local, CPGA 3.64, 4 sem GPA 3.53, LIR4 10? or 12? Can't really remember.  Applied to:  NUS FASS - application STILL processing NTU HSS - offered third choice Linguistics based on 4 sems, will appeal for PPGA or Sociology  SMU Social Science - application STILL processing  For those wondering, I could only apply with my 4 semesters as my internship was on my 5th semester, so no 5th sem results. For NUS and SMU, they have made it clear to me at the many times I asked that they will not be making a decision based on 4 semesters if I don't meet the cut-off and will wait for the full transcript. As for NTU, their policy is to process with 4 semesters anyway and will make decision based on it.  Thankfully, my 4-semesters GPA somehow got me an interview with Linguistics. I was called up in early April, went for the writing test and interview, and got offered 2 days after my interview. When I went, two girls I spoke to both did not put Linguistics as their first choice. I believe most in the room (about 7 of us) possibly also did not do so and they were processing applications pushed down from other courses.  Just like to ask a few things I didn't see answers for despite stalking this thread quite religiously:  1) Those who got rejected - you guys got explicit rejection letters via email?  2) Those who got FASS interview and writing test - may I know what is it about? I am still hoping to DA into FASS but up till now no calls, pretty much nothing.  3) For the NTU appeal, should I write about how I have improved a lot and actually qualify for both PPGA and Soci with my 6-sems or focus on why I want to tranfer into these courses instead? Also, do you appeal specifically into one course or do they just assume you are appealing for whatever courses you didn't get?  4) Anyone applied for CAPT and have gone for the interview already?  As for DA: I did not have a CCA in school but I actively volunteered outside of school and did take on one very big role in one of the biggest community events in SG. Its way above the average amount that students would volunteer so I am hopeful yet at the same time not expectant. Have not seen a case of someone admitted via DA for community service.  I do think that my application remains processing for both NUS and SMU due to the fact that I am very borderline plus my DA is via community service. They have much better applicants to offer to but I am just praying very hard that at the end of this waiting game is good news.  Some other info that may help:  SMU is appearing to be very generous with their Biz Ad interviews this year as I know 3 people with GPAs ranging from 3.5-3.6 being offered interviews, aka already one step in if they don't screw up the interview. Could help that they come from related courses but I hope this give others in the same shoe some hope! No news is good news!  Cheers everybody! I like the positive vibes going on for the NTU appeals. Hope everybody eventually get to where they belong! ",13.626150825437827

What she is trying to say is that the entire admissions process, even with the grades required, is skewed towards the JC kids.  Some examples: 1) Poly application window is in Feb, basically when we are busiest with our last projects in poly life (poly kids will know this as hell week), we still have to complete our application. I am not sure if it applies to every JC, but I know some JC provide guidance to their students in writing their personal statement if required. Poly - I tried to ask for help, but no one could help me lol. I even went for further ed/career guidance counselling but it seems that I know the facts and the competitiveness better than the counselor. So yes, poly is expecting poly kids to go out and work after poly. (But let's be honest - so many of us still want to move onto uni, public or private) JC kids - you all basically on holiday when expected to make an application.  2) As she mentioned - Open House AFTER our application. When I was NUS' Open Day, I went to the admissions booth to ask about something and there was an Indian father with his son from IB, also asking why is the Open House after their application. Yeah, you could say that we can still find out information on our own, call NUS to ask them about their programs if we are interested etc but aren't we just as much of an applicant and prospective student as the JC kids are... But truth is that they are still looking to recruit JC kids that's why the Open Day is so conveniently dated after their A'Level results are released. (P.S.: IB even earlier, apply in Jan) 3) Considering us based on 4 or 5 sems - NTU considered only my 4-semesters worth of results when making an offer as I could only submit 4-sems at the point of application. I am now appealing to my first choice but as all of us here know, chances are very slim. So my question is - why can't they hold onto their decisions and decide with my full cert? My final sem results literally is my entire year 3 modules because 5th sem roll over to the final sem due to FYP judging. Their explanation is for those with 5 sems, usually not much of a diff by the time 6th sem come, which I agree to some extent, but I believe if the student manage to pull up his grades enough to qualify him for the course he wants, it is doing disservice to his efforts. It is like making a decision based on your prelim results for A'Level kids. I am not complaining about how the odds are against us to begin with. I am just asking for the universities to see all applicants as equal, and given an equally fair shot at being considered. Sorry for the long wall of text - I just want to give you guys some context, which I don't think JC kids would know if not.  ((Tbh, poly kids if you all don't have a preference, there are several engineering is not that hard to go in if you don't mind. GPA 3.4? 3.5? to safely secure a place. 3.4/3.5 should be manageable if you don't slack off too much and put in effort for your assignment/projects, and study for your exams.)) Guys stop arguing here. You just need to work hard whichever path you take that's all.  For myself, I went to Poly, achieved CGPA 3.99/4.00. Doing a SMU Double Degree in Business & Accountancy now and my CGPA is 3.90/4.00 - which is Summa Cum Laude, First Class Honours. And my GPA is obviously higher than quite alot of JC/IB students in SMU, even though I'm from Poly. At the end of the day, stop whining and crying over where you came from. Whether you came from a non-privileged or privileged background, if you did not get a spot in a Local Uni you only have yourself to blame because you did not work hard enough during 'A' levels or Poly.  And Poly students, you know fully well that more spots are allocated to JC students. It's a fact. Move on with it. You know that only the top 10 - 15% of the Poly cohort gets Local Uni admissions. So what if it's not equal, the government has been pushing for an increase in no. of spots allocated to Poly students.  And so what if it's not equal? Being the top 10-15% in poly shows your immense pedigree. Same logic goes to applying for Ivy Leagues with acceptance rates of 1%, you gonna complain to them to ask them to increase their acceptance rate? Or you going to work hard to be part of that 1%? Get over it.  And don't even talk about difference in opportunities because even I wasn't born with a silver spoon myself. Wherever you come from, work hard and succeed.

I'm actually currently an ITE (going to be graduating soon) student that's looking on to which polytechnics I should advance on and then subsequently, I intend on going to Uni to do a degree. While I think the PBL-pedagogy is great I would prefer something old school perhaps like at SP, NYP or maybe even NP. I would be okay with joining any of their generalised Business Diplomas, but because my lecturers here at ITE have been telling me to go to RP supposedly ("for increased chances to get top student and go to Uni") hence that was where I was going with my original question on RP students who are mainly from R48, R52- what were their odds on advancing to University. Ultimately, I do not want to jeopardise my chances of getting to Uni if I go to RP, because I think even tho there are some benefits about PBL- the Big3 Unis still have some doubts & stigma about the learning style there at RP. At least that's what I heard when I talked to my lecturers.  Idk about you but I feel RP's Business or "Management" courses feels really lackluster in terms of what they cover unlike other Polys which offer dual specialisation options. Some of these which one can maybe even use in Uni? I would love to hear your thoughts.

All students enrolling in NTU academic programmes that lead to the award of a degree must matriculate with the University before commencing their studies. A person's status as a matriculated student will cease when he completes his study and is conferred his degree, or if he opts to withdraw from his study, or when his candidature is terminated by the University. Matriculation carries with it the agreement to abide by University rules and regulations, and codes of conduct.

2017,Singapore Management University|smu,Temasek Junior College|temasek jc|tjc|computer|com|infosys|information systems|analytics,"Hi all,  Signing up for an account and posting for the first time as this thread has given me a lot of information and insight into the whole application process.  Actually I have been reading the past few years' threads as well only to realise how I must really buck up on my GPA and thanks to the realisation of how difficult it is to get into uni, I eventually managed to pull up my grades, with lots of stress of course.  Would like to contribute what I can:  Local, CPGA 3.64, 4 sem GPA 3.53, LIR4 10? or 12? Can't really remember.  Applied to:  NUS FASS - application STILL processing NTU HSS - offered third choice Linguistics based on 4 sems, will appeal for PPGA or Sociology  SMU Social Science - application STILL processing  For those wondering, I could only apply with my 4 semesters as my internship was on my 5th semester, so no 5th sem results. For NUS and SMU, they have made it clear to me at the many times I asked that they will not be making a decision based on 4 semesters if I don't meet the cut-off and will wait for the full transcript. As for NTU, their policy is to process with 4 semesters anyway and will make decision based on it.  Thankfully, my 4-semesters GPA somehow got me an interview with Linguistics. I was called up in early April, went for the writing test and interview, and got offered 2 days after my interview. When I went, two girls I spoke to both did not put Linguistics as their first choice. I believe most in the room (about 7 of us) possibly also did not do so and they were processing applications pushed down from other courses.  Just like to ask a few things I didn't see answers for despite stalking this thread quite religiously:  1) Those who got rejected - you guys got explicit rejection letters via email?  2) Those who got FASS interview and writing test - may I know what is it about? I am still hoping to DA into FASS but up till now no calls, pretty much nothing.  3) For the NTU appeal, should I write about how I have improved a lot and actually qualify for both PPGA and Soci with my 6-sems or focus on why I want to tranfer into these courses instead? Also, do you appeal specifically into one course or do they just assume you are appealing for whatever courses you didn't get?  4) Anyone applied for CAPT and have gone for the interview already?  As for DA: I did not have a CCA in school but I actively volunteered outside of school and did take on one very big role in one of the biggest community events in SG. Its way above the average amount that students would volunteer so I am hopeful yet at the same time not expectant. Have not seen a case of someone admitted via DA for community service.  I do think that my application remains processing for both NUS and SMU due to the fact that I am very borderline plus my DA is via community service. They have much better applicants to offer to but I am just praying very hard that at the end of this waiting game is good news.  Some other info that may help:  SMU is appearing to be very generous with their Biz Ad interviews this year as I know 3 people with GPAs ranging from 3.5-3.6 being offered interviews, aka already one step in if they don't screw up the interview. Could help that they come from related courses but I hope this give others in the same shoe some hope! No news is good news!  Cheers everybody! I like the positive vibes going on for the NTU appeals. Hope everybody eventually get to where they belong! ",13.626150825437827

What she is trying to say is that the entire admissions process, even with the grades required, is skewed towards the JC kids.  Some examples: 1) Poly application window is in Feb, basically when we are busiest with our last projects in poly life (poly kids will know this as hell week), we still have to complete our application. I am not sure if it applies to every JC, but I know some JC provide guidance to their students in writing their personal statement if required. Poly - I tried to ask for help, but no one could help me lol. I even went for further ed/career guidance counselling but it seems that I know the facts and the competitiveness better than the counselor. So yes, poly is expecting poly kids to go out and work after poly. (But let's be honest - so many of us still want to move onto uni, public or private) JC kids - you all basically on holiday when expected to make an application.  2) As she mentioned - Open House AFTER our application. When I was NUS' Open Day, I went to the admissions booth to ask about something and there was an Indian father with his son from IB, also asking why is the Open House after their application. Yeah, you could say that we can still find out information on our own, call NUS to ask them about their programs if we are interested etc but aren't we just as much of an applicant and prospective student as the JC kids are... But truth is that they are still looking to recruit JC kids that's why the Open Day is so conveniently dated after their A'Level results are released. (P.S.: IB even earlier, apply in Jan) 3) Considering us based on 4 or 5 sems - NTU considered only my 4-semesters worth of results when making an offer as I could only submit 4-sems at the point of application. I am now appealing to my first choice but as all of us here know, chances are very slim. So my question is - why can't they hold onto their decisions and decide with my full cert? My final sem results literally is my entire year 3 modules because 5th sem roll over to the final sem due to FYP judging. Their explanation is for those with 5 sems, usually not much of a diff by the time 6th sem come, which I agree to some extent, but I believe if the student manage to pull up his grades enough to qualify him for the course he wants, it is doing disservice to his efforts. It is like making a decision based on your prelim results for A'Level kids. I am not complaining about how the odds are against us to begin with. I am just asking for the universities to see all applicants as equal, and given an equally fair shot at being considered. Sorry for the long wall of text - I just want to give you guys some context, which I don't think JC kids would know if not.  ((Tbh, poly kids if you all don't have a preference, there are several engineering is not that hard to go in if you don't mind. GPA 3.4? 3.5? to safely secure a place. 3.4/3.5 should be manageable if you don't slack off too much and put in effort for your assignment/projects, and study for your exams.)) Guys stop arguing here. You just need to work hard whichever path you take that's all.  For myself, I went to Poly, achieved CGPA 3.99/4.00. Doing a SMU Double Degree in Business & Accountancy now and my CGPA is 3.90/4.00 - which is Summa Cum Laude, First Class Honours. And my GPA is obviously higher than quite alot of JC/IB students in SMU, even though I'm from Poly. At the end of the day, stop whining and crying over where you came from. Whether you came from a non-privileged or privileged background, if you did not get a spot in a Local Uni you only have yourself to blame because you did not work hard enough during 'A' levels or Poly.  And Poly students, you know fully well that more spots are allocated to JC students. It's a fact. Move on with it. You know that only the top 10 - 15% of the Poly cohort gets Local Uni admissions. So what if it's not equal, the government has been pushing for an increase in no. of spots allocated to Poly students.  And so what if it's not equal? Being the top 10-15% in poly shows your immense pedigree. Same logic goes to applying for Ivy Leagues with acceptance rates of 1%, you gonna complain to them to ask them to increase their acceptance rate? Or you going to work hard to be part of that 1%? Get over it.  And don't even talk about difference in opportunities because even I wasn't born with a silver spoon myself. Wherever you come from, work hard and succeed.

I'm actually currently an ITE (going to be graduating soon) student that's looking on to which polytechnics I should advance on and then subsequently, I intend on going to Uni to do a degree. While I think the PBL-pedagogy is great I would prefer something old school perhaps like at SP, NYP or maybe even NP. I would be okay with joining any of their generalised Business Diplomas, but because my lecturers here at ITE have been telling me to go to RP supposedly ("for increased chances to get top student and go to Uni") hence that was where I was going with my original question on RP students who are mainly from R48, R52- what were their odds on advancing to University. Ultimately, I do not want to jeopardise my chances of getting to Uni if I go to RP, because I think even tho there are some benefits about PBL- the Big3 Unis still have some doubts & stigma about the learning style there at RP. At least that's what I heard when I talked to my lecturers.  Idk about you but I feel RP's Business or "Management" courses feels really lackluster in terms of what they cover unlike other Polys which offer dual specialisation options. Some of these which one can maybe even use in Uni? I would love to hear your thoughts.

All students enrolling in NTU academic programmes that lead to the award of a degree must matriculate with the University before commencing their studies. A person's status as a matriculated student will cease when he completes his study and is conferred his degree, or if he opts to withdraw from his study, or when his candidature is terminated by the University. Matriculation carries with it the agreement to abide by University rules and regulations, and codes of conduct.

2017,Singapore Management University|smu,Victoria Junior College|Victoria jc|vjc|computer|com|infosys|information systems|analytics,"Hi all,  Signing up for an account and posting for the first time as this thread has given me a lot of information and insight into the whole application process.  Actually I have been reading the past few years' threads as well only to realise how I must really buck up on my GPA and thanks to the realisation of how difficult it is to get into uni, I eventually managed to pull up my grades, with lots of stress of course.  Would like to contribute what I can:  Local, CPGA 3.64, 4 sem GPA 3.53, LIR4 10? or 12? Can't really remember.  Applied to:  NUS FASS - application STILL processing NTU HSS - offered third choice Linguistics based on 4 sems, will appeal for PPGA or Sociology  SMU Social Science - application STILL processing  For those wondering, I could only apply with my 4 semesters as my internship was on my 5th semester, so no 5th sem results. For NUS and SMU, they have made it clear to me at the many times I asked that they will not be making a decision based on 4 semesters if I don't meet the cut-off and will wait for the full transcript. As for NTU, their policy is to process with 4 semesters anyway and will make decision based on it.  Thankfully, my 4-semesters GPA somehow got me an interview with Linguistics. I was called up in early April, went for the writing test and interview, and got offered 2 days after my interview. When I went, two girls I spoke to both did not put Linguistics as their first choice. I believe most in the room (about 7 of us) possibly also did not do so and they were processing applications pushed down from other courses.  Just like to ask a few things I didn't see answers for despite stalking this thread quite religiously:  1) Those who got rejected - you guys got explicit rejection letters via email?  2) Those who got FASS interview and writing test - may I know what is it about? I am still hoping to DA into FASS but up till now no calls, pretty much nothing.  3) For the NTU appeal, should I write about how I have improved a lot and actually qualify for both PPGA and Soci with my 6-sems or focus on why I want to tranfer into these courses instead? Also, do you appeal specifically into one course or do they just assume you are appealing for whatever courses you didn't get?  4) Anyone applied for CAPT and have gone for the interview already?  As for DA: I did not have a CCA in school but I actively volunteered outside of school and did take on one very big role in one of the biggest community events in SG. Its way above the average amount that students would volunteer so I am hopeful yet at the same time not expectant. Have not seen a case of someone admitted via DA for community service.  I do think that my application remains processing for both NUS and SMU due to the fact that I am very borderline plus my DA is via community service. They have much better applicants to offer to but I am just praying very hard that at the end of this waiting game is good news.  Some other info that may help:  SMU is appearing to be very generous with their Biz Ad interviews this year as I know 3 people with GPAs ranging from 3.5-3.6 being offered interviews, aka already one step in if they don't screw up the interview. Could help that they come from related courses but I hope this give others in the same shoe some hope! No news is good news!  Cheers everybody! I like the positive vibes going on for the NTU appeals. Hope everybody eventually get to where they belong! ",13.626150825437827

What she is trying to say is that the entire admissions process, even with the grades required, is skewed towards the JC kids.  Some examples: 1) Poly application window is in Feb, basically when we are busiest with our last projects in poly life (poly kids will know this as hell week), we still have to complete our application. I am not sure if it applies to every JC, but I know some JC provide guidance to their students in writing their personal statement if required. Poly - I tried to ask for help, but no one could help me lol. I even went for further ed/career guidance counselling but it seems that I know the facts and the competitiveness better than the counselor. So yes, poly is expecting poly kids to go out and work after poly. (But let's be honest - so many of us still want to move onto uni, public or private) JC kids - you all basically on holiday when expected to make an application.  2) As she mentioned - Open House AFTER our application. When I was NUS' Open Day, I went to the admissions booth to ask about something and there was an Indian father with his son from IB, also asking why is the Open House after their application. Yeah, you could say that we can still find out information on our own, call NUS to ask them about their programs if we are interested etc but aren't we just as much of an applicant and prospective student as the JC kids are... But truth is that they are still looking to recruit JC kids that's why the Open Day is so conveniently dated after their A'Level results are released. (P.S.: IB even earlier, apply in Jan) 3) Considering us based on 4 or 5 sems - NTU considered only my 4-semesters worth of results when making an offer as I could only submit 4-sems at the point of application. I am now appealing to my first choice but as all of us here know, chances are very slim. So my question is - why can't they hold onto their decisions and decide with my full cert? My final sem results literally is my entire year 3 modules because 5th sem roll over to the final sem due to FYP judging. Their explanation is for those with 5 sems, usually not much of a diff by the time 6th sem come, which I agree to some extent, but I believe if the student manage to pull up his grades enough to qualify him for the course he wants, it is doing disservice to his efforts. It is like making a decision based on your prelim results for A'Level kids. I am not complaining about how the odds are against us to begin with. I am just asking for the universities to see all applicants as equal, and given an equally fair shot at being considered. Sorry for the long wall of text - I just want to give you guys some context, which I don't think JC kids would know if not.  ((Tbh, poly kids if you all don't have a preference, there are several engineering is not that hard to go in if you don't mind. GPA 3.4? 3.5? to safely secure a place. 3.4/3.5 should be manageable if you don't slack off too much and put in effort for your assignment/projects, and study for your exams.)) Guys stop arguing here. You just need to work hard whichever path you take that's all.  For myself, I went to Poly, achieved CGPA 3.99/4.00. Doing a SMU Double Degree in Business & Accountancy now and my CGPA is 3.90/4.00 - which is Summa Cum Laude, First Class Honours. And my GPA is obviously higher than quite alot of JC/IB students in SMU, even though I'm from Poly. At the end of the day, stop whining and crying over where you came from. Whether you came from a non-privileged or privileged background, if you did not get a spot in a Local Uni you only have yourself to blame because you did not work hard enough during 'A' levels or Poly.  And Poly students, you know fully well that more spots are allocated to JC students. It's a fact. Move on with it. You know that only the top 10 - 15% of the Poly cohort gets Local Uni admissions. So what if it's not equal, the government has been pushing for an increase in no. of spots allocated to Poly students.  And so what if it's not equal? Being the top 10-15% in poly shows your immense pedigree. Same logic goes to applying for Ivy Leagues with acceptance rates of 1%, you gonna complain to them to ask them to increase their acceptance rate? Or you going to work hard to be part of that 1%? Get over it.  And don't even talk about difference in opportunities because even I wasn't born with a silver spoon myself. Wherever you come from, work hard and succeed.

I'm actually currently an ITE (going to be graduating soon) student that's looking on to which polytechnics I should advance on and then subsequently, I intend on going to Uni to do a degree. While I think the PBL-pedagogy is great I would prefer something old school perhaps like at SP, NYP or maybe even NP. I would be okay with joining any of their generalised Business Diplomas, but because my lecturers here at ITE have been telling me to go to RP supposedly ("for increased chances to get top student and go to Uni") hence that was where I was going with my original question on RP students who are mainly from R48, R52- what were their odds on advancing to University. Ultimately, I do not want to jeopardise my chances of getting to Uni if I go to RP, because I think even tho there are some benefits about PBL- the Big3 Unis still have some doubts & stigma about the learning style there at RP. At least that's what I heard when I talked to my lecturers.  Idk about you but I feel RP's Business or "Management" courses feels really lackluster in terms of what they cover unlike other Polys which offer dual specialisation options. Some of these which one can maybe even use in Uni? I would love to hear your thoughts.

Instead, he now partnered another RP School of Management and Communication graduate to run a chain of 5 Mince Meat Noodle stalls at heartland kopitiams.

All students enrolling in NTU academic programmes that lead to the award of a degree must matriculate with the University before commencing their studies. A person's status as a matriculated student will cease when he completes his study and is conferred his degree, or if he opts to withdraw from his study, or when his candidature is terminated by the University.

Actually I have been reading the past few years' threads as well only to realise how I must really buck up on my GPA and thanks to the realisation of how difficult it is to get into uni, I eventually managed to pull up my grades, with lots of stress of course.  Would like to contribute what I can:  Local, CPGA 3.64, 4 sem GPA 3.53, LIR4 10? or 12? Can't really remember.  Applied to:  NUS FASS - application STILL processing NTU HSS - offered third choice Linguistics based on 4 sems, will appeal for PPGA or Sociology  SMU Social Science - application STILL processing  For those wondering, I could only apply with my 4 semesters as my internship was on my 5th semester, so no 5th sem results. For NUS and SMU, they have made it clear to me at the many times I asked that they will not be making a decision based on 4 semesters if I don't meet the cut-off and will wait for the full transcript. As for NTU, their policy is to process with 4 semesters anyway and will make decision based on it.  Thankfully, my 4-semesters GPA somehow got me an interview with Linguistics. I was called up in early April, went for the writing test and interview, and got offered 2 days after my interview. When I went, two girls I spoke to both did not put Linguistics as their first choice. I believe most in the room (about 7 of us) possibly also did not do so and they were processing applications pushed down from other courses.  Just like to ask a few things I didn't see answers for despite stalking this thread quite religiously:  1) Those who got rejected - you guys got explicit rejection letters via email?  2) Those who got FASS interview and writing test - may I know what is it about? I am still hoping to DA into FASS but up till now no calls, pretty much nothing.  3) For the NTU appeal, should I write about how I have improved a lot and actually qualify for both PPGA and Soci with my 6-sems or focus on why I want to tranfer into these courses instead? Also, do you appeal specifically into one course or do they just assume you are appealing for whatever courses you didn't get?  4) Anyone applied for CAPT and have gone for the interview already?  As for DA: I did not have a CCA in school but I actively volunteered outside of school and did take on one very big role in one of the biggest community events in SG. Its way above the average amount that students would volunteer so I am hopeful yet at the same time not expectant. Have not seen a case of someone admitted via DA for community service.  I do think that my application remains processing for both NUS and SMU due to the fact that I am very borderline plus my DA is via community service. They have much better applicants to offer to but I am just praying very hard that at the end of this waiting game is good news.  Some other info that may help:  SMU is appearing to be very generous with their Biz Ad interviews this year as I know 3 people with GPAs ranging from 3.5-3.6 being offered interviews, aka already one step in if they don't screw up the interview. Could help that they come from related courses but I hope this give others in the same shoe some hope! No news is good news!  Cheers everybody! I like the positive vibes going on for the NTU appeals. Hope everybody eventually get to where they belong! ",13.626150825437827

What she is trying to say is that the entire admissions process, even with the grades required, is skewed towards the JC kids.  Some examples: 1) Poly application window is in Feb, basically when we are busiest with our last projects in poly life (poly kids will know this as hell week), we still have to complete our application. I am not sure if it applies to every JC, but I know some JC provide guidance to their students in writing their personal statement if required. Poly - I tried to ask for help, but no one could help me lol. I even went for further ed/career guidance counselling but it seems that I know the facts and the competitiveness better than the counselor. So yes, poly is expecting poly kids to go out and work after poly. (But let's be honest - so many of us still want to move onto uni, public or private) JC kids - you all basically on holiday when expected to make an application.  2) As she mentioned - Open House AFTER our application. When I was NUS' Open Day, I went to the admissions booth to ask about something and there was an Indian father with his son from IB, also asking why is the Open House after their application. Yeah, you could say that we can still find out information on our own, call NUS to ask them about their programs if we are interested etc but aren't we just as much of an applicant and prospective student as the JC kids are... But truth is that they are still looking to recruit JC kids that's why the Open Day is so conveniently dated after their A'Level results are released. (P.S.: IB even earlier, apply in Jan) 3) Considering us based on 4 or 5 sems - NTU considered only my 4-semesters worth of results when making an offer as I could only submit 4-sems at the point of application. I am now appealing to my first choice but as all of us here know, chances are very slim. So my question is - why can't they hold onto their decisions and decide with my full cert? My final sem results literally is my entire year 3 modules because 5th sem roll over to the final sem due to FYP judging. Their explanation is for those with 5 sems, usually not much of a diff by the time 6th sem come, which I agree to some extent, but I believe if the student manage to pull up his grades enough to qualify him for the course he wants, it is doing disservice to his efforts. It is like making a decision based on your prelim results for A'Level kids. I am not complaining about how the odds are against us to begin with. I am just asking for the universities to see all applicants as equal, and given an equally fair shot at being considered. Sorry for the long wall of text - I just want to give you guys some context, which I don't think JC kids would know if not.  ((Tbh, poly kids if you all don't have a preference, there are several engineering is not that hard to go in if you don't mind. GPA 3.4? 3.5? to safely secure a place. 3.4/3.5 should be manageable if you don't slack off too much and put in effort for your assignment/projects, and study for your exams.)) Guys stop arguing here. You just need to work hard whichever path you take that's all.  For myself, I went to Poly, achieved CGPA 3.99/4.00. Doing a SMU Double Degree in Business & Accountancy now and my CGPA is 3.90/4.00 - which is Summa Cum Laude, First Class Honours. And my GPA is obviously higher than quite alot of JC/IB students in SMU, even though I'm from Poly. At the end of the day, stop whining and crying over where you came from. Whether you came from a non-privileged or privileged background, if you did not get a spot in a Local Uni you only have yourself to blame because you did not work hard enough during 'A' levels or Poly.  And Poly students, you know fully well that more spots are allocated to JC students. It's a fact. Move on with it. You know that only the top 10 - 15% of the Poly cohort gets Local Uni admissions. So what if it's not equal, the government has been pushing for an increase in no. of spots allocated to Poly students.  And so what if it's not equal? Being the top 10-15% in poly shows your immense pedigree. Same logic goes to applying for Ivy Leagues with acceptance rates of 1%, you gonna complain to them to ask them to increase their acceptance rate? Or you going to work hard to be part of that 1%? Get over it.  And don't even talk about difference in opportunities because even I wasn't born with a silver spoon myself. Wherever you come from, work hard and succeed.

While I think the PBL-pedagogy is great I would prefer something old school perhaps like at SP, NYP or maybe even NP. I would be okay with joining any of their generalised Business Diplomas, but because my lecturers here at ITE have been telling me to go to RP supposedly ("for increased chances to get top student and go to Uni") hence that was where I was going with my original question on RP students who are mainly from R48, R52- what were their odds on advancing to University. Ultimately, I do not want to jeopardise my chances of getting to Uni if I go to RP, because I think even tho there are some benefits about PBL- the Big3 Unis still have some doubts & stigma about the learning style there at RP. At least that's what I heard when I talked to my lecturers.  Idk about you but I feel RP's Business or "Management" courses feels really lackluster in terms of what they cover unlike other Polys which offer dual specialisation options. Some of these which one can maybe even use in Uni? I would love to hear your thoughts.

SMU rejected me or on waiting list now. Prepared so much in the topic but apparently not on the dress code or speaking enough like an ang moh. I was the only one that came in jeans and sneakers while everyone else were wearing formal. Is that overdress or what's to be expected? (I don't get why the email even said smart casual, but I just followed the email...) NTU and NUS completely ignoring me forever. I've gotten so depressed I'm no longer depressed. Perhaps this is one way of curing yourself of depression: where everything becomes a delusion and nothing in life matters anymore. It sucks that everything to form a judgment on someone can just be based on a single event on a single day and nothing else, but well, that's life. You can say there's still time but I just can't take waiting up to 3 agonizing more months later. If anything, the only realistic thing in life that will ever happen is me writing that appeal letter. Before your comments get lost in the sea of comments on this very active forum, let me reply to your rant/concerns. I just want to say that I get you. I totally do. Why? I was once in your position last year. Unknowingly fell into depression during the waiting period from April to May because I waited hopelessly for things that eventually (and obviously) did not come true... Exactly 1 year ago on this date (13 April 2017), I received a devastating offer from NTU — environmental engineering, and that was my last choice. It was supposed to be a celebration, that I received an offer, but it was the absolute last thing I wanted, since it wasn't my first choice, and something that I knew I couldn't accept doing (and was stupid enough to even place it in my choices, ah well).  Subsequently I got rejected by NUS and SMU, because I simply didn't make the cut... With a heavy heart I signed up (late) for private A levels, and as much as I hated the idea of having to retake, having to suffer... I had no choice. I really wanted to prove to myself that I CAN get into local uni. It didn't help when I'm from one of the top JCs, and my friends are moving on happily to overseas unis with unconditional offers, scholarships, or medicine, law, dentistry... you name it. I was utterly alone. And I felt like I was the only loser in my school (and also a disgrace to my school) who had to retake A levels, who couldn't really make the cut for local uni. In the end, ALL my appeals failed. What's new? Reality slapped me hard in the face, and it hurt like a bitch, of course. What could I do? I had to move on. I then spent some time correcting my mindset before I was actually more mentally stable for my exams. But I just have to tell you that you are really doing yourself a huge disfavour right now. Yes you are disappointed, you are not receiving news, everything seems oh so damn hopeless. But self pity will only kill you, as well as the people around you who love and care for you... do know that YOU are not the only one suffering, your family and friends are too! Everything seems bleak right now yes, but once you get that offer, everything will be merry and bright...  For me, I knew that I wanted to go to uni. I spent that one more year not just preparing for retake, but also redefining my goals and aspirations in my life. Also, building on my character. Depression no more! There were many sacrifices made, many times that I felt like hiding in a cave... but I overcame that and grew so much stronger. As long as you YEARN it, you will get it no matter what, because no one can stop you!! So don't even let the demons in your head stop you, please do not give in to depression. No one can help you except yourself. I suggest you try meditation and yoga, those things saved my ass (': And here I am back this year, legitly exactly one year later. I received my offer from NTU business...... It took one more year, but it was so worth it. Although my story might not be the most impressive one, but I've proved to everyone and most importantly myself that if I want something, I'm gonna make sure I get it, even if it means one year later. Because this is my future, and I am the captain of my ship of fate. I hope that you realise this too, be proud of who you are, of your battlescars, failures and experiences. All these will shape you into who you are — a better you. Chin up!! ",14.782297202659237

I heard from a senior in fass that 1 module in fass is about 1 lecture & 1 tutorial per week btw. The benefits of smu: 1. You get to interact and actively engage yourself during lessons. 2. More internship and exchange opportunities than nus. 3. Many students take double majors and more % taking double degree. 4. More specialisation tracks. 5. Higher employment and salary on average according to the employment survey. The downsides of smu: 1. Competition in smu is fierce. 2. Less campus life (in terms of hall etc) 3. The % of honours students there is lower than fass as it is harder to achieve honours in smu. 4. Less opportunities to make friends (Depends on your personality) The advantages of fass: 1. Lecture-tutorial style of learning, good for shy students who prefer mugging in a corner 2. Higher % of honours 3. Greater cohort size >> bell curve affects students less 3. You can take double majors too by DA or in the 2nd/3rd year 4. More campus life 5. Can stay in RC/hall etc. 6. For eg. econs is more academic and math inclined 7. World QS ranking The disadvantages of NUS: 1. Must find internships & exchange opportunities via the student (?) office. 2. Heavier and more modules esp for double major students (be prepared). I was offered double majors via DA, I counted 4 more modules for NUS than smu for the same double major combination. 3. More in depth and harder modules than smu (from my senior). 4. Hall/RC life may affect your academics. 5. Less specialisation tracks than smu.  Disclaimer ** What I think is subjective, I don’t mean to offend any NUS/SMU students reading this 😅 This is the summary of my ‘research’ haha xD. I am also deciding between nus and smu. Currently reading some year 1 stuff to see which one I like more I got SMU econs,  NUS FASS DMP and NBS offer tooWow your research is so detailed! Haha  Some things I would like to clarify for the benefit of everyone, which is based on my own knowledge and experience talking to friends across all 3 universities.  First and foremost, please take the employment surveys as a pinch of salt. Your salary won't be guaranteed to be higher just because you are enrolled in a particular university that is reported to have higher gross starting pay. Trust me,  when I was deciding on uni like you guys many years ago, I was affected by the graduate employment survey as well but then after years in uni and finally working,  I realised the survey might be misleading... Just so you know, most of these times when the graduates answer these surveys, the schools don't even check whether the pay you entered is true or not...How much you will get for your starting pay depends on your EXPERIENCE, your GRADES, your NEGOTIATION SKILLS, the ECONOMIC OUTLOOK at that POINT IN TIME,  the INDUSTRY and JOB SCOPE. Which uni honestly doesn't matter, cos all 3 local unis are considered on par to one another in the employers' eyes.  and it's just gross pay. There are other components in a salary package like bonuses and benefits which are not captured in the employment surveys. Some people may have a lower gross pay but may have higher bonuses and benefits (eg more days of leave) than someone with higher gross pay who may have less attractive bonuses and benefits. And many times, these surveys are not even representative of the whole student population as not all 100% of the graduating cohort would have completed the survey. Maybe it's just that small handful of students who did the survey and skewed the data?  regarding the point about students in nus being only able to source for internships from career office... That is not true at all. You can always self source (meaning you apply via websites like linkedin for eg by yourself) Oh and student exchange definitely must apply via student office regardless of whether is it nus ntu or smu... Cos all uni already have a list of overseas exchange partner universities that students can apply to then the student office will facilitate the process lor. The process is more or less the same across all 3 uni de.  And one more thing about nus I thought is worth mentioning, they have this NUS Overseas College (NOC) programme where you get to spend 1 year overseas studying and interning... You get to accumulate overseas work exp and clear modules like exchange as well. And the internships are paid. And there are many countries u can go to via this programme - Europe, Asia, USA. Do look it up. I kinda regretted not going 😭 cos it's such a valuable opportunity esp if u are passionate about entrepreneurship.Even if u are not its fine it's still great overseas exposure and it value adds to your resume! Oh and every school is competitive, not just SMU because regardless of which course or uni you go to, the bell curve is everywhere.  Choose your school based on the curriculum, the non academic opportunities available and the culture. Talk to seniors Or students who are studying in the universities and courses you have in mind to find out more. Talk to the recent students who have just graduated to find out more about the actual employment prospects and salary trends across the various unis and courses.  Hope this helps more people to come to a decision on which school to choose.",14.148768385457506

The bonus points, applicable to programmes not requiring a pre-entry interview, will be added to the student’s University Admission Score. " http://news.nus.edu.sg/highlights/nu...on-initiatives NUS applicants to get bonus points for 1st-choice courses Passion for a field of study will count for admission to the National University of Singapore (NUS) from this year. Those applying for a place at NUS will be given 1.25 bonus points for their first choice - equivalent to going from C to B or B to A in an A-level H1 subject. This applies only to courses where entry is based purely on converting a student's grades into points, and not to courses such as medicine and law where students are assessed on their aptitude and interests through interviews. NUS senior deputy president and provost Ho Teck Hua, who announced the move at a press conference on Monday, said NUS analysis of admission data showed the bonus point can make a difference. "Let's say one student with 81 points applies for communications as his first choice, and another with 82 points applies to the same course as his second choice. With the 1.25 points, the student who lists the course as his first choice will get ahead of the person with 82 points," he said. On why NUS decided on the move, he said: "If you have done well and are passionate about a career in business or computing, for example, then we want to say to you that we support your passion." "We want to help you pursue your passion," he said, adding that students passionate about what they study tend to perform better. Professor Ho revealed that, currently, 65 per cent of students given a place in their first-choice course take up the offer, while only 45 per cent of those given their second-choice course do so. Noting NUS graduates' good job prospects, Prof Ho also announced that NUS will be increasing the number of double majors to increase career options for its graduates. "The nature of work is changing very rapidly, and we need to prepare students for a lifetime of diverse careers," he said. He said NUS, which currently offers 94 double major and major-minor combinations, will add another 86 such programmes. "Someone doing data science and entrepreneurship, for example, can go and work for a range of industries in data science, and also go and do a start-up." On top of the double majors, NUS also offers 71 double degrees, 33 joint degrees with partner universities and 24 concurrent degrees. Adding all this, currently 15 per cent of NUS students are trained in more than one discipline. Prof Ho said he hopes half of all NUS students will graduate with knowledge and skills in two different fields, so they will have more job offers to choose from. He also announced two new degree programmes for this year, one in pharmaceutical science and the other in veterinary science. Students taking up the 5 1/2-year concurrent veterinary degree programme will graduate with an NUS degree in life sciences and a Doctor of Veterinary Medicine from the University of Melbourne. NUS, which now offers 230 bond-free merit scholarships, will add 200 more scholarships for the new academic year. Ms Geraldine Tan, 19, welcomed the move by NUS and said it is important for young people to get into a field that excites them. She said: "I really want to study business and maybe go on an overseas college stint as I want to start a social enterprise. Business courses are hard to get into, so I am hoping the bonus points will help me get the edge." Hwa Chong Institution student Hannah Ganesh, 18, said increasing double degree options is good as students can diversify their learning and "challenge themselves".http://www.straitstimes.com/singapor...choice-courses NUS' new offerings BONUS POINTS FOR FIRST CHOICE Students applying to NUS will be given 1.25 bonus points for their first-choice course. This applies only to courses where entry is based purely on students' grades. MORE DOUBLE MAJORS NUS will be increasing the number of double majors to open up more career options for its graduates. It currently offers 94 double major and major-minor combinations and will add another 86 such programmes. NEW DEGREES A new concurrent degree combines NUS' Bachelor of Science and the Doctor of Veterinary Medicine offered by the University of Melbourne. Students can complete the programmes in 5-1/2 years. NUS is also offering a new joint degree in pharmaceutical science with the University of Dundee in Scotland. The programme is designed to provide students with knowledge and skills for careers in the pharmaceutical, biomedical and consumer healthcare sectors. NUS OVERSEAS COLLEGES The programme that sends students on internships to several entrepreneurial hubs in the world will be extended to Jakarta and Toronto. MORE BOND-FREE SCHOLARSHIPS NUS, which now offers 230 bond-free merit scholarships, will add another 200 scholarships in the new academic year. ",12.588820677513752

Totally agree with you that scholarship should not be awarded based on academic performance only, which I did mention in my earlier post. The primary objective of my earlier post aims to encourage individuals who are currently applying/appealing for admission and/or scholarship - through the sharing of my education journey and the challenges experienced as an individual with a disadvantaged background. Subsequently, the post also seeks to highlight the flaws in the basis of selection for the scholarship interview. Today, institutions are still using a uniform assessment method to evaluate people of diverse backgrounds. The assessment for academic potential is pretty straightforward - cGPA, awards, and other academic achievement obtained from other sources (e.g. competitions, courses, etc.). The tricky part lies in the assessment of non-academic components - institutions seek individuals with certain attributes, qualities, and skills (e.g. leadership, teamwork, entrepreneurship, integrity, sports achievement, etc.). And often, institutions only consider school-related activities and/or co-curricular activities as the samples for their assessment.  On a personal note, I believed that those attributes, qualities, and skillscould also beidentified and assessed through employment experience (e.g. customers' testimonials, appraisals by superiors, awards attained, etc.).  In general, institutions should also look beyond the school-related activities and co-curricular activities when assessing the non-academic components of individuals. Hence, granting more flexibility for underprivileged students whose non-academic profile were considered as "insubstantial" and thereby allowing  them to have the opportunity to share their stories. Ultimately, an interview is all we need.P.s. I'm glad that your hard work paid off, and congrats on securing that scholarship offered by a private company  (I missed the application deadline for private & government scholarship ) To be shortlisted for interview on the government scholarship with 3.5GPA, you must have some really outstanding non-academic achievements! Do you mind to share with us? And hello senior , assuming you are an SMU student (based on the GPA capped at 4.0). As an individual with similar experience, juggling between full-time work and study is really no joke, not to mention that you are doing it at the University-level and still managed to scored a decent grade. Mind to share what full-time job you work as? Do you study in the day, and work at night/after-school hours? Did you, perhaps, packed all modules into that few days so that you could work for the rest of the days in the week? Sincerely hope that you can share some tips with us/me Networking/cloud computing consultant. And if you can get some really well-known individual in the industry to write recommendation letter would really be helpful.  I think due to my competition award as well as the system I build for one of the major hospital which became part of the national healthcare system.

If business is your end goal, start thinking of alternatives; for example maybe taking economica or an arts course but majoring in business and then perhaps appealing for transfer etc, or writing that appeal letter. You can make life alot harder for yourself by focusing on the negative stuff, or to make an excuse for why things didnt go your way. Learn from them, its a choice, YOUR choice.

Before your comments get lost in the sea of comments on this very active forum, let me reply to your rant/concerns. I just want to say that I get you. I totally do. Why? I was once in your position last year. Unknowingly fell into depression during the waiting period from April to May because I waited hopelessly for things that eventually (and obviously) did not come true... Exactly 1 year ago on this date (13 April 2017), I received a devastating offer from NTU — environmental engineering, and that was my last choice. It was supposed to be a celebration, that I received an offer, but it was the absolute last thing I wanted, since it wasn't my first choice, and something that I knew I couldn't accept doing (and was stupid enough to even place it in my choices, ah well).  Subsequently I got rejected by NUS and SMU, because I simply didn't make the cut... With a heavy heart I signed up (late) for private A levels, and as much as I hated the idea of having to retake, having to suffer... I had no choice. I really wanted to prove to myself that I CAN get into local uni. It didn't help when I'm from one of the top JCs, and my friends are moving on happily to overseas unis with unconditional offers, scholarships, or medicine, law, dentistry... you name it. I was utterly alone. And I felt like I was the only loser in my school (and also a disgrace to my school) who had to retake A levels, who couldn't really make the cut for local uni. In the end, ALL my appeals failed. What's new? Reality slapped me hard in the face, and it hurt like a bitch, of course. What could I do? I had to move on. I then spent some time correcting my mindset before I was actually more mentally stable for my exams. But I just have to tell you that you are really doing yourself a huge disfavour right now. Yes you are disappointed, you are not receiving news, everything seems oh so damn hopeless. But self pity will only kill you, as well as the people around you who love and care for you... do know that YOU are not the only one suffering, your family and friends are too! Everything seems bleak right now yes, but once you get that offer, everything will be merry and bright...  For me, I knew that I wanted to go to uni. I spent that one more year not just preparing for retake, but also redefining my goals and aspirations in my life. Also, building on my character. Depression no more! There were many sacrifices made, many times that I felt like hiding in a cave... but I overcame that and grew so much stronger. As long as you YEARN it, you will get it no matter what, because no one can stop you!! So don't even let the demons in your head stop you, please do not give in to depression. No one can help you except yourself. I suggest you try meditation and yoga, those things saved my ass (': And here I am back this year, legitly exactly one year later. I received my offer from NTU business...... It took one more year, but it was so worth it. Although my story might not be the most impressive one, but I've proved to everyone and most importantly myself that if I want something, I'm gonna make sure I get it, even if it means one year later. Because this is my future, and I am the captain of my ship of fate. I hope that you realise this too, be proud of who you are, of your battlescars, failures and experiences. All these will shape you into who you are — a better you. Chin up!! ",14.810094327339348

I heard from a senior in fass that 1 module in fass is about 1 lecture & 1 tutorial per week btw. The benefits of smu: 1. You get to interact and actively engage yourself during lessons. 2. More internship and exchange opportunities than nus. 3. Many students take double majors and more % taking double degree. 4. More specialisation tracks. 5. Higher employment and salary on average according to the employment survey. The downsides of smu: 1. Competition in smu is fierce. 2. Less campus life (in terms of hall etc) 3. The % of honours students there is lower than fass as it is harder to achieve honours in smu. 4. Less opportunities to make friends (Depends on your personality) The advantages of fass: 1. Lecture-tutorial style of learning, good for shy students who prefer mugging in a corner 2. Higher % of honours 3. Greater cohort size >> bell curve affects students less 3. You can take double majors too by DA or in the 2nd/3rd year 4. More campus life 5. Can stay in RC/hall etc. 6. For eg. econs is more academic and math inclined 7. World QS ranking The disadvantages of NUS: 1. Must find internships & exchange opportunities via the student (?) office. 2. Heavier and more modules esp for double major students (be prepared). I was offered double majors via DA, I counted 4 more modules for NUS than smu for the same double major combination. 3. More in depth and harder modules than smu (from my senior). 4. Hall/RC life may affect your academics. 5. Less specialisation tracks than smu.  Disclaimer ** What I think is subjective, I don’t mean to offend any NUS/SMU students reading this 😅 This is the summary of my ‘research’ haha xD. I am also deciding between nus and smu. Currently reading some year 1 stuff to see which one I like more I got SMU econs,  NUS FASS DMP and NBS offer tooWow your research is so detailed! Haha  Some things I would like to clarify for the benefit of everyone, which is based on my own knowledge and experience talking to friends across all 3 universities.  First and foremost, please take the employment surveys as a pinch of salt. Your salary won't be guaranteed to be higher just because you are enrolled in a particular university that is reported to have higher gross starting pay. Trust me,  when I was deciding on uni like you guys many years ago, I was affected by the graduate employment survey as well but then after years in uni and finally working,  I realised the survey might be misleading... Just so you know, most of these times when the graduates answer these surveys, the schools don't even check whether the pay you entered is true or not...How much you will get for your starting pay depends on your EXPERIENCE, your GRADES, your NEGOTIATION SKILLS, the ECONOMIC OUTLOOK at that POINT IN TIME,  the INDUSTRY and JOB SCOPE. Which uni honestly doesn't matter, cos all 3 local unis are considered on par to one another in the employers' eyes.  and it's just gross pay. There are other components in a salary package like bonuses and benefits which are not captured in the employment surveys. Some people may have a lower gross pay but may have higher bonuses and benefits (eg more days of leave) than someone with higher gross pay who may have less attractive bonuses and benefits. And many times, these surveys are not even representative of the whole student population as not all 100% of the graduating cohort would have completed the survey. Maybe it's just that small handful of students who did the survey and skewed the data?  regarding the point about students in nus being only able to source for internships from career office... That is not true at all. You can always self source (meaning you apply via websites like linkedin for eg by yourself) Oh and student exchange definitely must apply via student office regardless of whether is it nus ntu or smu... Cos all uni already have a list of overseas exchange partner universities that students can apply to then the student office will facilitate the process lor. The process is more or less the same across all 3 uni de.  And one more thing about nus I thought is worth mentioning, they have this NUS Overseas College (NOC) programme where you get to spend 1 year overseas studying and interning... You get to accumulate overseas work exp and clear modules like exchange as well. And the internships are paid. And there are many countries u can go to via this programme - Europe, Asia, USA. Do look it up. I kinda regretted not going 😭 cos it's such a valuable opportunity esp if u are passionate about entrepreneurship.Even if u are not its fine it's still great overseas exposure and it value adds to your resume! Oh and every school is competitive, not just SMU because regardless of which course or uni you go to, the bell curve is everywhere.  Choose your school based on the curriculum, the non academic opportunities available and the culture. Talk to seniors Or students who are studying in the universities and courses you have in mind to find out more. Talk to the recent students who have just graduated to find out more about the actual employment prospects and salary trends across the various unis and courses.  Hope this helps more people to come to a decision on which school to choose.",14.147112283948838

Thanks whuttt wrote:  Good news for those borderline cases eyeing NUS " . . . . the plan to award up to 1.25 bonus points (equivalent of one H1 grade) to students applying for their first choice programme. The bonus points, applicable to programmes not requiring a pre-entry interview, will be added to the student’s University Admission Score. " http://news.nus.edu.sg/highlights/nu...on-initiatives NUS applicants to get bonus points for 1st-choice courses Passion for a field of study will count for admission to the National University of Singapore (NUS) from this year. Those applying for a place at NUS will be given 1.25 bonus points for their first choice - equivalent to going from C to B or B to A in an A-level H1 subject. This applies only to courses where entry is based purely on converting a student's grades into points, and not to courses such as medicine and law where students are assessed on their aptitude and interests through interviews. NUS senior deputy president and provost Ho Teck Hua, who announced the move at a press conference on Monday, said NUS analysis of admission data showed the bonus point can make a difference. "Let's say one student with 81 points applies for communications as his first choice, and another with 82 points applies to the same course as his second choice. With the 1.25 points, the student who lists the course as his first choice will get ahead of the person with 82 points," he said. On why NUS decided on the move, he said: "If you have done well and are passionate about a career in business or computing, for example, then we want to say to you that we support your passion." "We want to help you pursue your passion," he said, adding that students passionate about what they study tend to perform better. Professor Ho revealed that, currently, 65 per cent of students given a place in their first-choice course take up the offer, while only 45 per cent of those given their second-choice course do so. Noting NUS graduates' good job prospects, Prof Ho also announced that NUS will be increasing the number of double majors to increase career options for its graduates. "The nature of work is changing very rapidly, and we need to prepare students for a lifetime of diverse careers," he said. He said NUS, which currently offers 94 double major and major-minor combinations, will add another 86 such programmes. "Someone doing data science and entrepreneurship, for example, can go and work for a range of industries in data science, and also go and do a start-up." On top of the double majors, NUS also offers 71 double degrees, 33 joint degrees with partner universities and 24 concurrent degrees. Adding all this, currently 15 per cent of NUS students are trained in more than one discipline. Prof Ho said he hopes half of all NUS students will graduate with knowledge and skills in two different fields, so they will have more job offers to choose from. He also announced two new degree programmes for this year, one in pharmaceutical science and the other in veterinary science. Students taking up the 5 1/2-year concurrent veterinary degree programme will graduate with an NUS degree in life sciences and a Doctor of Veterinary Medicine from the University of Melbourne. NUS, which now offers 230 bond-free merit scholarships, will add 200 more scholarships for the new academic year.

It currently offers 94 double major and major-minor combinations and will add another 86 such programmes. NEW DEGREES A new concurrent degree combines NUS' Bachelor of Science and the Doctor of Veterinary Medicine offered by the University of Melbourne. Students can complete the programmes in 5-1/2 years. NUS is also offering a new joint degree in pharmaceutical science with the University of Dundee in Scotland. The programme is designed to provide students with knowledge and skills for careers in the pharmaceutical, biomedical and consumer healthcare sectors. NUS OVERSEAS COLLEGES The programme that sends students on internships to several entrepreneurial hubs in the world will be extended to Jakarta and Toronto. MORE BOND-FREE SCHOLARSHIPS NUS, which now offers 230 bond-free merit scholarships, will add another 200 scholarships in the new academic year. ",12.582265899331869

The reason for this is they design the program in such a way that you need to know how to code before enroll to the program. ICT SE and IS is very intensive, beginners will have a hard time to catch up. For example, one of our project is to write a web crawler and do data analysis and come out application(s) in C++, it must complete within 4 weeks. Those who have zero programming background will suffer very badly. The lecture slides only teach you how to sit, but project expect you to fly. We have other project running concurrently, including class test. Once project submission is up, next week (two days later) our first exam paper. ICT student with a different perspective here. Yes the director said that. Yes the deadlines are like that.  But, noone said you can't submit projects early. Also this is university. Anyone who expects projects to be scoped to only what is learnt in lectures needs a wake up call. Also, the fear mongering here is a little overdone. Its all about the aptitude for absorbing information. I know a guy from an unrelated diploma with 0 coding knowledge on track for first class while a 3.6 it diploma person is struggling to pass. I come from a decent secondary school. 80% of my class went to A levels. Majority dont even consider SIT. Those good enough to go to NTU SMU NUS SUTD will go there instead. The students in ICT right now are basically guinea pigs. Its a risk they dont have to take.  For those that don't do well enough probably don't like studying altogether and would rather go to sim for a faster degree or will choose to retake a levels. That leaves us with the ones that do badly for A levels and are desperate to get into a 'local uni' without wasting time.

Totally agree with you that scholarship should not be awarded based on academic performance only, which I did mention in my earlier post. The primary objective of my earlier post aims to encourage individuals who are currently applying/appealing for admission and/or scholarship - through the sharing of my education journey and the challenges experienced as an individual with a disadvantaged background. Subsequently, the post also seeks to highlight the flaws in the basis of selection for the scholarship interview. Today, institutions are still using a uniform assessment method to evaluate people of diverse backgrounds. The assessment for academic potential is pretty straightforward - cGPA, awards, and other academic achievement obtained from other sources (e.g. competitions, courses, etc.). The tricky part lies in the assessment of non-academic components - institutions seek individuals with certain attributes, qualities, and skills (e.g. leadership, teamwork, entrepreneurship, integrity, sports achievement, etc.). And often, institutions only consider school-related activities and/or co-curricular activities as the samples for their assessment.  On a personal note, I believed that those attributes, qualities, and skillscould also beidentified and assessed through employment experience (e.g. customers' testimonials, appraisals by superiors, awards attained, etc.).  In general, institutions should also look beyond the school-related activities and co-curricular activities when assessing the non-academic components of individuals. Hence, granting more flexibility for underprivileged students whose non-academic profile were considered as "insubstantial" and thereby allowing  them to have the opportunity to share their stories. Ultimately, an interview is all we need.P.s. I'm glad that your hard work paid off, and congrats on securing that scholarship offered by a private company  (I missed the application deadline for private & government scholarship ) To be shortlisted for interview on the government scholarship with 3.5GPA, you must have some really outstanding non-academic achievements! Do you mind to share with us? And hello senior , assuming you are an SMU student (based on the GPA capped at 4.0). As an individual with similar experience, juggling between full-time work and study is really no joke, not to mention that you are doing it at the University-level and still managed to scored a decent grade. Mind to share what full-time job you work as? Do you study in the day, and work at night/after-school hours? Did you, perhaps, packed all modules into that few days so that you could work for the rest of the days in the week? Sincerely hope that you can share some tips with us/me Networking/cloud computing consultant. And if you can get some really well-known individual in the industry to write recommendation letter would really be helpful.  I think due to my competition award as well as the system I build for one of the major hospital which became part of the national healthcare system.

Before your comments get lost in the sea of comments on this very active forum, let me reply to your rant/concerns. I just want to say that I get you. I totally do. Why? I was once in your position last year. Unknowingly fell into depression during the waiting period from April to May because I waited hopelessly for things that eventually (and obviously) did not come true... Exactly 1 year ago on this date (13 April 2017), I received a devastating offer from NTU — environmental engineering, and that was my last choice. It was supposed to be a celebration, that I received an offer, but it was the absolute last thing I wanted, since it wasn't my first choice, and something that I knew I couldn't accept doing (and was stupid enough to even place it in my choices, ah well).  Subsequently I got rejected by NUS and SMU, because I simply didn't make the cut... With a heavy heart I signed up (late) for private A levels, and as much as I hated the idea of having to retake, having to suffer... I had no choice. I really wanted to prove to myself that I CAN get into local uni. It didn't help when I'm from one of the top JCs, and my friends are moving on happily to overseas unis with unconditional offers, scholarships, or medicine, law, dentistry... you name it. I was utterly alone. And I felt like I was the only loser in my school (and also a disgrace to my school) who had to retake A levels, who couldn't really make the cut for local uni. In the end, ALL my appeals failed. What's new? Reality slapped me hard in the face, and it hurt like a bitch, of course. What could I do? I had to move on. I then spent some time correcting my mindset before I was actually more mentally stable for my exams. But I just have to tell you that you are really doing yourself a huge disfavour right now. Yes you are disappointed, you are not receiving news, everything seems oh so damn hopeless. But self pity will only kill you, as well as the people around you who love and care for you... do know that YOU are not the only one suffering, your family and friends are too! Everything seems bleak right now yes, but once you get that offer, everything will be merry and bright...  For me, I knew that I wanted to go to uni. I spent that one more year not just preparing for retake, but also redefining my goals and aspirations in my life. Also, building on my character. Depression no more! There were many sacrifices made, many times that I felt like hiding in a cave... but I overcame that and grew so much stronger. As long as you YEARN it, you will get it no matter what, because no one can stop you!! So don't even let the demons in your head stop you, please do not give in to depression. No one can help you except yourself. I suggest you try meditation and yoga, those things saved my ass (': And here I am back this year, legitly exactly one year later. I received my offer from NTU business...... It took one more year, but it was so worth it. Although my story might not be the most impressive one, but I've proved to everyone and most importantly myself that if I want something, I'm gonna make sure I get it, even if it means one year later. Because this is my future, and I am the captain of my ship of fate. I hope that you realise this too, be proud of who you are, of your battlescars, failures and experiences. All these will shape you into who you are — a better you. Chin up!! ",14.824326189619134

I heard from a senior in fass that 1 module in fass is about 1 lecture & 1 tutorial per week btw. The benefits of smu: 1. You get to interact and actively engage yourself during lessons. 2. More internship and exchange opportunities than nus. 3. Many students take double majors and more % taking double degree. 4. More specialisation tracks. 5. Higher employment and salary on average according to the employment survey. The downsides of smu: 1. Competition in smu is fierce. 2. Less campus life (in terms of hall etc) 3. The % of honours students there is lower than fass as it is harder to achieve honours in smu. 4. Less opportunities to make friends (Depends on your personality) The advantages of fass: 1. Lecture-tutorial style of learning, good for shy students who prefer mugging in a corner 2. Higher % of honours 3. Greater cohort size >> bell curve affects students less 3. You can take double majors too by DA or in the 2nd/3rd year 4. More campus life 5. Can stay in RC/hall etc. 6. For eg. econs is more academic and math inclined 7. World QS ranking The disadvantages of NUS: 1. Must find internships & exchange opportunities via the student (?) office. 2. Heavier and more modules esp for double major students (be prepared). I was offered double majors via DA, I counted 4 more modules for NUS than smu for the same double major combination. 3. More in depth and harder modules than smu (from my senior). 4. Hall/RC life may affect your academics. 5. Less specialisation tracks than smu.  Disclaimer ** What I think is subjective, I don’t mean to offend any NUS/SMU students reading this 😅 This is the summary of my ‘research’ haha xD. I am also deciding between nus and smu. Currently reading some year 1 stuff to see which one I like more I got SMU econs,  NUS FASS DMP and NBS offer tooWow your research is so detailed! Haha  Some things I would like to clarify for the benefit of everyone, which is based on my own knowledge and experience talking to friends across all 3 universities.  First and foremost, please take the employment surveys as a pinch of salt. Your salary won't be guaranteed to be higher just because you are enrolled in a particular university that is reported to have higher gross starting pay. Trust me,  when I was deciding on uni like you guys many years ago, I was affected by the graduate employment survey as well but then after years in uni and finally working,  I realised the survey might be misleading... Just so you know, most of these times when the graduates answer these surveys, the schools don't even check whether the pay you entered is true or not...How much you will get for your starting pay depends on your EXPERIENCE, your GRADES, your NEGOTIATION SKILLS, the ECONOMIC OUTLOOK at that POINT IN TIME,  the INDUSTRY and JOB SCOPE. Which uni honestly doesn't matter, cos all 3 local unis are considered on par to one another in the employers' eyes.  and it's just gross pay. There are other components in a salary package like bonuses and benefits which are not captured in the employment surveys. Some people may have a lower gross pay but may have higher bonuses and benefits (eg more days of leave) than someone with higher gross pay who may have less attractive bonuses and benefits. And many times, these surveys are not even representative of the whole student population as not all 100% of the graduating cohort would have completed the survey. Maybe it's just that small handful of students who did the survey and skewed the data?  regarding the point about students in nus being only able to source for internships from career office... That is not true at all. You can always self source (meaning you apply via websites like linkedin for eg by yourself) Oh and student exchange definitely must apply via student office regardless of whether is it nus ntu or smu... Cos all uni already have a list of overseas exchange partner universities that students can apply to then the student office will facilitate the process lor. The process is more or less the same across all 3 uni de.  And one more thing about nus I thought is worth mentioning, they have this NUS Overseas College (NOC) programme where you get to spend 1 year overseas studying and interning... You get to accumulate overseas work exp and clear modules like exchange as well. And the internships are paid. And there are many countries u can go to via this programme - Europe, Asia, USA. Do look it up. I kinda regretted not going 😭 cos it's such a valuable opportunity esp if u are passionate about entrepreneurship.Even if u are not its fine it's still great overseas exposure and it value adds to your resume! Oh and every school is competitive, not just SMU because regardless of which course or uni you go to, the bell curve is everywhere.  Choose your school based on the curriculum, the non academic opportunities available and the culture. Talk to seniors Or students who are studying in the universities and courses you have in mind to find out more. Talk to the recent students who have just graduated to find out more about the actual employment prospects and salary trends across the various unis and courses.  Hope this helps more people to come to a decision on which school to choose.",14.175555987026902

ICT1001 doesn't teach how to write stored procedure and other more advanced SQL statement such as left join, right join, union etc, while project if you know these trick, it can decrease the burden of writing inefficient codes.

" http://news.nus.edu.sg/highlights/nu...on-initiatives NUS applicants to get bonus points for 1st-choice courses Passion for a field of study will count for admission to the National University of Singapore (NUS) from this year. Those applying for a place at NUS will be given 1.25 bonus points for their first choice - equivalent to going from C to B or B to A in an A-level H1 subject. This applies only to courses where entry is based purely on converting a student's grades into points, and not to courses such as medicine and law where students are assessed on their aptitude and interests through interviews. NUS senior deputy president and provost Ho Teck Hua, who announced the move at a press conference on Monday, said NUS analysis of admission data showed the bonus point can make a difference. "Let's say one student with 81 points applies for communications as his first choice, and another with 82 points applies to the same course as his second choice. With the 1.25 points, the student who lists the course as his first choice will get ahead of the person with 82 points," he said. On why NUS decided on the move, he said: "If you have done well and are passionate about a career in business or computing, for example, then we want to say to you that we support your passion." "We want to help you pursue your passion," he said, adding that students passionate about what they study tend to perform better. Professor Ho revealed that, currently, 65 per cent of students given a place in their first-choice course take up the offer, while only 45 per cent of those given their second-choice course do so. Noting NUS graduates' good job prospects, Prof Ho also announced that NUS will be increasing the number of double majors to increase career options for its graduates. "The nature of work is changing very rapidly, and we need to prepare students for a lifetime of diverse careers," he said. He said NUS, which currently offers 94 double major and major-minor combinations, will add another 86 such programmes. "Someone doing data science and entrepreneurship, for example, can go and work for a range of industries in data science, and also go and do a start-up." On top of the double majors, NUS also offers 71 double degrees, 33 joint degrees with partner universities and 24 concurrent degrees. Adding all this, currently 15 per cent of NUS students are trained in more than one discipline. Prof Ho said he hopes half of all NUS students will graduate with knowledge and skills in two different fields, so they will have more job offers to choose from. He also announced two new degree programmes for this year, one in pharmaceutical science and the other in veterinary science. Students taking up the 5 1/2-year concurrent veterinary degree programme will graduate with an NUS degree in life sciences and a Doctor of Veterinary Medicine from the University of Melbourne. NUS, which now offers 230 bond-free merit scholarships, will add 200 more scholarships for the new academic year. Ms Geraldine Tan, 19, welcomed the move by NUS and said it is important for young people to get into a field that excites them. She said: "I really want to study business and maybe go on an overseas college stint as I want to start a social enterprise. Business courses are hard to get into, so I am hoping the bonus points will help me get the edge." Hwa Chong Institution student Hannah Ganesh, 18, said increasing double degree options is good as students can diversify their learning and "challenge themselves".http://www.straitstimes.com/singapor...choice-courses NUS' new offerings BONUS POINTS FOR FIRST CHOICE Students applying to NUS will be given 1.25 bonus points for their first-choice course. This applies only to courses where entry is based purely on students' grades. MORE DOUBLE MAJORS NUS will be increasing the number of double majors to open up more career options for its graduates. It currently offers 94 double major and major-minor combinations and will add another 86 such programmes. NEW DEGREES A new concurrent degree combines NUS' Bachelor of Science and the Doctor of Veterinary Medicine offered by the University of Melbourne. Students can complete the programmes in 5-1/2 years. NUS is also offering a new joint degree in pharmaceutical science with the University of Dundee in Scotland. The programme is designed to provide students with knowledge and skills for careers in the pharmaceutical, biomedical and consumer healthcare sectors. NUS OVERSEAS COLLEGES The programme that sends students on internships to several entrepreneurial hubs in the world will be extended to Jakarta and Toronto. MORE BOND-FREE SCHOLARSHIPS NUS, which now offers 230 bond-free merit scholarships, will add another 200 scholarships in the new academic year. ",12.615733325111655

The reason for this is they design the program in such a way that you need to know how to code before enroll to the program. ICT SE and IS is very intensive, beginners will have a hard time to catch up. For example, one of our project is to write a web crawler and do data analysis and come out application(s) in C++, it must complete within 4 weeks. Those who have zero programming background will suffer very badly. The lecture slides only teach you how to sit, but project expect you to fly. We have other project running concurrently, including class test. Once project submission is up, next week (two days later) our first exam paper. ICT student with a different perspective here. Yes the director said that. Yes the deadlines are like that.  But, noone said you can't submit projects early. Also this is university. Anyone who expects projects to be scoped to only what is learnt in lectures needs a wake up call. Also, the fear mongering here is a little overdone. Its all about the aptitude for absorbing information. I know a guy from an unrelated diploma with 0 coding knowledge on track for first class while a 3.6 it diploma person is struggling to pass. I come from a decent secondary school. 80% of my class went to A levels. Majority dont even consider SIT. Those good enough to go to NTU SMU NUS SUTD will go there instead. The students in ICT right now are basically guinea pigs. Its a risk they dont have to take.  For those that don't do well enough probably don't like studying altogether and would rather go to sim for a faster degree or will choose to retake a levels. That leaves us with the ones that do badly for A levels and are desperate to get into a 'local uni' without wasting time. Its not surprising that these people end up getting rejected after being interviewed. Edit: One thing that I need to mention is the program is in NO WAY designed that you NEED to know how to code before coming. Saying so is discrediting the professors that work hard to design the program.  The ramp up is fast I admit, but thats the nature of computer science ask anyone in nus/ntu comp sci or smu is, they will tell you the same thing. The first semester subject starts the knowledge train from SCRATCH. If you don't believe me, ask the famous yanying/guyz92 to send you the first few lectures for 1002, which module title is literally programming fundamentals.  I challenge anyone who has seen that to tell me that its not meant for someone with 0 background in coding. The professors themselves reiterate in the first lecture to tell us not to worry if you have no background because they will teach the basics to you.",12.601150807772804

Totally agree with you that scholarship should not be awarded based on academic performance only, which I did mention in my earlier post. The primary objective of my earlier post aims to encourage individuals who are currently applying/appealing for admission and/or scholarship - through the sharing of my education journey and the challenges experienced as an individual with a disadvantaged background. Subsequently, the post also seeks to highlight the flaws in the basis of selection for the scholarship interview. Today, institutions are still using a uniform assessment method to evaluate people of diverse backgrounds. The assessment for academic potential is pretty straightforward - cGPA, awards, and other academic achievement obtained from other sources (e.g. competitions, courses, etc.). The tricky part lies in the assessment of non-academic components - institutions seek individuals with certain attributes, qualities, and skills (e.g. leadership, teamwork, entrepreneurship, integrity, sports achievement, etc.). And often, institutions only consider school-related activities and/or co-curricular activities as the samples for their assessment.  On a personal note, I believed that those attributes, qualities, and skillscould also beidentified and assessed through employment experience (e.g. customers' testimonials, appraisals by superiors, awards attained, etc.).  In general, institutions should also look beyond the school-related activities and co-curricular activities when assessing the non-academic components of individuals. Hence, granting more flexibility for underprivileged students whose non-academic profile were considered as "insubstantial" and thereby allowing  them to have the opportunity to share their stories. Ultimately, an interview is all we need.P.s. I'm glad that your hard work paid off, and congrats on securing that scholarship offered by a private company  (I missed the application deadline for private & government scholarship ) To be shortlisted for interview on the government scholarship with 3.5GPA, you must have some really outstanding non-academic achievements! Do you mind to share with us? And hello senior , assuming you are an SMU student (based on the GPA capped at 4.0). As an individual with similar experience, juggling between full-time work and study is really no joke, not to mention that you are doing it at the University-level and still managed to scored a decent grade. Mind to share what full-time job you work as? Do you study in the day, and work at night/after-school hours? Did you, perhaps, packed all modules into that few days so that you could work for the rest of the days in the week? Sincerely hope that you can share some tips with us/me Networking/cloud computing consultant.

Before your comments get lost in the sea of comments on this very active forum, let me reply to your rant/concerns. I just want to say that I get you. I totally do. Why? I was once in your position last year. Unknowingly fell into depression during the waiting period from April to May because I waited hopelessly for things that eventually (and obviously) did not come true... Exactly 1 year ago on this date (13 April 2017), I received a devastating offer from NTU — environmental engineering, and that was my last choice. It was supposed to be a celebration, that I received an offer, but it was the absolute last thing I wanted, since it wasn't my first choice, and something that I knew I couldn't accept doing (and was stupid enough to even place it in my choices, ah well).  Subsequently I got rejected by NUS and SMU, because I simply didn't make the cut... With a heavy heart I signed up (late) for private A levels, and as much as I hated the idea of having to retake, having to suffer... I had no choice. I really wanted to prove to myself that I CAN get into local uni. It didn't help when I'm from one of the top JCs, and my friends are moving on happily to overseas unis with unconditional offers, scholarships, or medicine, law, dentistry... you name it. I was utterly alone. And I felt like I was the only loser in my school (and also a disgrace to my school) who had to retake A levels, who couldn't really make the cut for local uni. In the end, ALL my appeals failed. What's new? Reality slapped me hard in the face, and it hurt like a bitch, of course. What could I do? I had to move on. I then spent some time correcting my mindset before I was actually more mentally stable for my exams. But I just have to tell you that you are really doing yourself a huge disfavour right now. Yes you are disappointed, you are not receiving news, everything seems oh so damn hopeless. But self pity will only kill you, as well as the people around you who love and care for you... do know that YOU are not the only one suffering, your family and friends are too! Everything seems bleak right now yes, but once you get that offer, everything will be merry and bright...  For me, I knew that I wanted to go to uni. I spent that one more year not just preparing for retake, but also redefining my goals and aspirations in my life. Also, building on my character. Depression no more! There were many sacrifices made, many times that I felt like hiding in a cave... but I overcame that and grew so much stronger. As long as you YEARN it, you will get it no matter what, because no one can stop you!! So don't even let the demons in your head stop you, please do not give in to depression. No one can help you except yourself. I suggest you try meditation and yoga, those things saved my ass (': And here I am back this year, legitly exactly one year later. I received my offer from NTU business...... It took one more year, but it was so worth it. Although my story might not be the most impressive one, but I've proved to everyone and most importantly myself that if I want something, I'm gonna make sure I get it, even if it means one year later. Because this is my future, and I am the captain of my ship of fate. I hope that you realise this too, be proud of who you are, of your battlescars, failures and experiences. All these will shape you into who you are — a better you. Chin up!! ",14.831009606446912

I heard from a senior in fass that 1 module in fass is about 1 lecture & 1 tutorial per week btw. The benefits of smu: 1. You get to interact and actively engage yourself during lessons. 2. More internship and exchange opportunities than nus. 3. Many students take double majors and more % taking double degree. 4. More specialisation tracks. 5. Higher employment and salary on average according to the employment survey. The downsides of smu: 1. Competition in smu is fierce. 2. Less campus life (in terms of hall etc) 3. The % of honours students there is lower than fass as it is harder to achieve honours in smu. 4. Less opportunities to make friends (Depends on your personality) The advantages of fass: 1. Lecture-tutorial style of learning, good for shy students who prefer mugging in a corner 2. Higher % of honours 3. Greater cohort size >> bell curve affects students less 3. You can take double majors too by DA or in the 2nd/3rd year 4. More campus life 5. Can stay in RC/hall etc. 6. For eg. econs is more academic and math inclined 7. World QS ranking The disadvantages of NUS: 1. Must find internships & exchange opportunities via the student (?) office. 2. Heavier and more modules esp for double major students (be prepared). I was offered double majors via DA, I counted 4 more modules for NUS than smu for the same double major combination. 3. More in depth and harder modules than smu (from my senior). 4. Hall/RC life may affect your academics. 5. Less specialisation tracks than smu.  Disclaimer ** What I think is subjective, I don’t mean to offend any NUS/SMU students reading this 😅 This is the summary of my ‘research’ haha xD. I am also deciding between nus and smu. Currently reading some year 1 stuff to see which one I like more I got SMU econs,  NUS FASS DMP and NBS offer tooWow your research is so detailed! Haha  Some things I would like to clarify for the benefit of everyone, which is based on my own knowledge and experience talking to friends across all 3 universities.  First and foremost, please take the employment surveys as a pinch of salt. Your salary won't be guaranteed to be higher just because you are enrolled in a particular university that is reported to have higher gross starting pay. Trust me,  when I was deciding on uni like you guys many years ago, I was affected by the graduate employment survey as well but then after years in uni and finally working,  I realised the survey might be misleading... Just so you know, most of these times when the graduates answer these surveys, the schools don't even check whether the pay you entered is true or not...How much you will get for your starting pay depends on your EXPERIENCE, your GRADES, your NEGOTIATION SKILLS, the ECONOMIC OUTLOOK at that POINT IN TIME,  the INDUSTRY and JOB SCOPE. Which uni honestly doesn't matter, cos all 3 local unis are considered on par to one another in the employers' eyes.  and it's just gross pay. There are other components in a salary package like bonuses and benefits which are not captured in the employment surveys. Some people may have a lower gross pay but may have higher bonuses and benefits (eg more days of leave) than someone with higher gross pay who may have less attractive bonuses and benefits. And many times, these surveys are not even representative of the whole student population as not all 100% of the graduating cohort would have completed the survey. Maybe it's just that small handful of students who did the survey and skewed the data?  regarding the point about students in nus being only able to source for internships from career office... That is not true at all. You can always self source (meaning you apply via websites like linkedin for eg by yourself) Oh and student exchange definitely must apply via student office regardless of whether is it nus ntu or smu... Cos all uni already have a list of overseas exchange partner universities that students can apply to then the student office will facilitate the process lor. The process is more or less the same across all 3 uni de.  And one more thing about nus I thought is worth mentioning, they have this NUS Overseas College (NOC) programme where you get to spend 1 year overseas studying and interning... You get to accumulate overseas work exp and clear modules like exchange as well. And the internships are paid. And there are many countries u can go to via this programme - Europe, Asia, USA. Do look it up. I kinda regretted not going 😭 cos it's such a valuable opportunity esp if u are passionate about entrepreneurship.Even if u are not its fine it's still great overseas exposure and it value adds to your resume! Oh and every school is competitive, not just SMU because regardless of which course or uni you go to, the bell curve is everywhere.  Choose your school based on the curriculum, the non academic opportunities available and the culture. Talk to seniors Or students who are studying in the universities and courses you have in mind to find out more. Talk to the recent students who have just graduated to find out more about the actual employment prospects and salary trends across the various unis and courses.  Hope this helps more people to come to a decision on which school to choose.",14.183290096307399

Agreed on the part for ICT1002 Programming Fundamental, Python is for beginners to learn as var in Python is loosely assign, don't have to care about memory allocation etc. Once student touch C will be another extreme. Memory allocation now is important, assigning var with wrong format and precision will cause C application to crash.

If you are unlucky that 2 of out of 4 teammates not contribute much, you will having the feeling of a sinking boat. Just a project in ICT1004 implement all this different language.  If you are totally new to programming, having ICT1001 supplement these knowledge such as SQL query statement. ICT1001 doesn't teach how to write stored procedure and other more advanced SQL statement such as left join, right join, union etc, while project if you know these trick, it can decrease the burden of writing inefficient codes. Also freeloader in ICT is another problem, playing taichi and act blur not contributing to project while others doing the project, they use the time to study for class test and exam. Also known as "being carried". During exam for the first trimester, some wrote C code in PHP question, PHP code in Python question, Python code in JavaScript.

Thanks whuttt wrote:  Good news for those borderline cases eyeing NUS " . . . . the plan to award up to 1.25 bonus points (equivalent of one H1 grade) to students applying for their first choice programme. The bonus points, applicable to programmes not requiring a pre-entry interview, will be added to the student’s University Admission Score. " http://news.nus.edu.sg/highlights/nu...on-initiatives NUS applicants to get bonus points for 1st-choice courses Passion for a field of study will count for admission to the National University of Singapore (NUS) from this year. Those applying for a place at NUS will be given 1.25 bonus points for their first choice - equivalent to going from C to B or B to A in an A-level H1 subject. This applies only to courses where entry is based purely on converting a student's grades into points, and not to courses such as medicine and law where students are assessed on their aptitude and interests through interviews. NUS senior deputy president and provost Ho Teck Hua, who announced the move at a press conference on Monday, said NUS analysis of admission data showed the bonus point can make a difference. "Let's say one student with 81 points applies for communications as his first choice, and another with 82 points applies to the same course as his second choice. With the 1.25 points, the student who lists the course as his first choice will get ahead of the person with 82 points," he said. On why NUS decided on the move, he said: "If you have done well and are passionate about a career in business or computing, for example, then we want to say to you that we support your passion." "We want to help you pursue your passion," he said, adding that students passionate about what they study tend to perform better. Professor Ho revealed that, currently, 65 per cent of students given a place in their first-choice course take up the offer, while only 45 per cent of those given their second-choice course do so. Noting NUS graduates' good job prospects, Prof Ho also announced that NUS will be increasing the number of double majors to increase career options for its graduates. "The nature of work is changing very rapidly, and we need to prepare students for a lifetime of diverse careers," he said. He said NUS, which currently offers 94 double major and major-minor combinations, will add another 86 such programmes. "Someone doing data science and entrepreneurship, for example, can go and work for a range of industries in data science, and also go and do a start-up." On top of the double majors, NUS also offers 71 double degrees, 33 joint degrees with partner universities and 24 concurrent degrees. Adding all this, currently 15 per cent of NUS students are trained in more than one discipline. Prof Ho said he hopes half of all NUS students will graduate with knowledge and skills in two different fields, so they will have more job offers to choose from. He also announced two new degree programmes for this year, one in pharmaceutical science and the other in veterinary science. Students taking up the 5 1/2-year concurrent veterinary degree programme will graduate with an NUS degree in life sciences and a Doctor of Veterinary Medicine from the University of Melbourne. NUS, which now offers 230 bond-free merit scholarships, will add 200 more scholarships for the new academic year. Ms Geraldine Tan, 19, welcomed the move by NUS and said it is important for young people to get into a field that excites them. She said: "I really want to study business and maybe go on an overseas college stint as I want to start a social enterprise. Business courses are hard to get into, so I am hoping the bonus points will help me get the edge." Hwa Chong Institution student Hannah Ganesh, 18, said increasing double degree options is good as students can diversify their learning and "challenge themselves".http://www.straitstimes.com/singapor...choice-courses NUS' new offerings BONUS POINTS FOR FIRST CHOICE Students applying to NUS will be given 1.25 bonus points for their first-choice course. This applies only to courses where entry is based purely on students' grades. MORE DOUBLE MAJORS NUS will be increasing the number of double majors to open up more career options for its graduates. It currently offers 94 double major and major-minor combinations and will add another 86 such programmes. NEW DEGREES A new concurrent degree combines NUS' Bachelor of Science and the Doctor of Veterinary Medicine offered by the University of Melbourne. Students can complete the programmes in 5-1/2 years. NUS is also offering a new joint degree in pharmaceutical science with the University of Dundee in Scotland. The programme is designed to provide students with knowledge and skills for careers in the pharmaceutical, biomedical and consumer healthcare sectors. NUS OVERSEAS COLLEGES The programme that sends students on internships to several entrepreneurial hubs in the world will be extended to Jakarta and Toronto. MORE BOND-FREE SCHOLARSHIPS NUS, which now offers 230 bond-free merit scholarships, will add another 200 scholarships in the new academic year. ",12.597732102220949

The reason for this is they design the program in such a way that you need to know how to code before enroll to the program. ICT SE and IS is very intensive, beginners will have a hard time to catch up. For example, one of our project is to write a web crawler and do data analysis and come out application(s) in C++, it must complete within 4 weeks. Those who have zero programming background will suffer very badly. The lecture slides only teach you how to sit, but project expect you to fly. We have other project running concurrently, including class test. Once project submission is up, next week (two days later) our first exam paper. ICT student with a different perspective here. Yes the director said that. Yes the deadlines are like that.  But, noone said you can't submit projects early. Also this is university. Anyone who expects projects to be scoped to only what is learnt in lectures needs a wake up call. Also, the fear mongering here is a little overdone. Its all about the aptitude for absorbing information. I know a guy from an unrelated diploma with 0 coding knowledge on track for first class while a 3.6 it diploma person is struggling to pass. I come from a decent secondary school. 80% of my class went to A levels. Majority dont even consider SIT. Those good enough to go to NTU SMU NUS SUTD will go there instead. The students in ICT right now are basically guinea pigs. Its a risk they dont have to take.  For those that don't do well enough probably don't like studying altogether and would rather go to sim for a faster degree or will choose to retake a levels. That leaves us with the ones that do badly for A levels and are desperate to get into a 'local uni' without wasting time. Its not surprising that these people end up getting rejected after being interviewed.

Totally agree with you that scholarship should not be awarded based on academic performance only, which I did mention in my earlier post. The primary objective of my earlier post aims to encourage individuals who are currently applying/appealing for admission and/or scholarship - through the sharing of my education journey and the challenges experienced as an individual with a disadvantaged background. Subsequently, the post also seeks to highlight the flaws in the basis of selection for the scholarship interview. Today, institutions are still using a uniform assessment method to evaluate people of diverse backgrounds. The assessment for academic potential is pretty straightforward - cGPA, awards, and other academic achievement obtained from other sources (e.g. competitions, courses, etc.). The tricky part lies in the assessment of non-academic components - institutions seek individuals with certain attributes, qualities, and skills (e.g. leadership, teamwork, entrepreneurship, integrity, sports achievement, etc.). And often, institutions only consider school-related activities and/or co-curricular activities as the samples for their assessment.  On a personal note, I believed that those attributes, qualities, and skillscould also beidentified and assessed through employment experience (e.g. customers' testimonials, appraisals by superiors, awards attained, etc.).  In general, institutions should also look beyond the school-related activities and co-curricular activities when assessing the non-academic components of individuals. Hence, granting more flexibility for underprivileged students whose non-academic profile were considered as "insubstantial" and thereby allowing  them to have the opportunity to share their stories. Ultimately, an interview is all we need.P.s. I'm glad that your hard work paid off, and congrats on securing that scholarship offered by a private company  (I missed the application deadline for private & government scholarship ) To be shortlisted for interview on the government scholarship with 3.5GPA, you must have some really outstanding non-academic achievements! Do you mind to share with us? And hello senior , assuming you are an SMU student (based on the GPA capped at 4.0). As an individual with similar experience, juggling between full-time work and study is really no joke, not to mention that you are doing it at the University-level and still managed to scored a decent grade. Mind to share what full-time job you work as? Do you study in the day, and work at night/after-school hours? Did you, perhaps, packed all modules into that few days so that you could work for the rest of the days in the week? Sincerely hope that you can share some tips with us/me Networking/cloud computing consultant.

Before your comments get lost in the sea of comments on this very active forum, let me reply to your rant/concerns. I just want to say that I get you. I totally do. Why? I was once in your position last year. Unknowingly fell into depression during the waiting period from April to May because I waited hopelessly for things that eventually (and obviously) did not come true... Exactly 1 year ago on this date (13 April 2017), I received a devastating offer from NTU — environmental engineering, and that was my last choice. It was supposed to be a celebration, that I received an offer, but it was the absolute last thing I wanted, since it wasn't my first choice, and something that I knew I couldn't accept doing (and was stupid enough to even place it in my choices, ah well).  Subsequently I got rejected by NUS and SMU, because I simply didn't make the cut... With a heavy heart I signed up (late) for private A levels, and as much as I hated the idea of having to retake, having to suffer... I had no choice. I really wanted to prove to myself that I CAN get into local uni. It didn't help when I'm from one of the top JCs, and my friends are moving on happily to overseas unis with unconditional offers, scholarships, or medicine, law, dentistry... you name it. I was utterly alone. And I felt like I was the only loser in my school (and also a disgrace to my school) who had to retake A levels, who couldn't really make the cut for local uni. In the end, ALL my appeals failed. What's new? Reality slapped me hard in the face, and it hurt like a bitch, of course. What could I do? I had to move on. I then spent some time correcting my mindset before I was actually more mentally stable for my exams. But I just have to tell you that you are really doing yourself a huge disfavour right now. Yes you are disappointed, you are not receiving news, everything seems oh so damn hopeless. But self pity will only kill you, as well as the people around you who love and care for you... do know that YOU are not the only one suffering, your family and friends are too! Everything seems bleak right now yes, but once you get that offer, everything will be merry and bright...  For me, I knew that I wanted to go to uni. I spent that one more year not just preparing for retake, but also redefining my goals and aspirations in my life. Also, building on my character. Depression no more! There were many sacrifices made, many times that I felt like hiding in a cave... but I overcame that and grew so much stronger. As long as you YEARN it, you will get it no matter what, because no one can stop you!! So don't even let the demons in your head stop you, please do not give in to depression. No one can help you except yourself. I suggest you try meditation and yoga, those things saved my ass (': And here I am back this year, legitly exactly one year later. I received my offer from NTU business...... It took one more year, but it was so worth it. Although my story might not be the most impressive one, but I've proved to everyone and most importantly myself that if I want something, I'm gonna make sure I get it, even if it means one year later. Because this is my future, and I am the captain of my ship of fate. I hope that you realise this too, be proud of who you are, of your battlescars, failures and experiences. All these will shape you into who you are — a better you. Chin up!! ",14.834825498793322

I heard from a senior in fass that 1 module in fass is about 1 lecture & 1 tutorial per week btw. The benefits of smu: 1. You get to interact and actively engage yourself during lessons. 2. More internship and exchange opportunities than nus. 3. Many students take double majors and more % taking double degree. 4. More specialisation tracks. 5. Higher employment and salary on average according to the employment survey. The downsides of smu: 1. Competition in smu is fierce. 2. Less campus life (in terms of hall etc) 3. The % of honours students there is lower than fass as it is harder to achieve honours in smu. 4. Less opportunities to make friends (Depends on your personality) The advantages of fass: 1. Lecture-tutorial style of learning, good for shy students who prefer mugging in a corner 2. Higher % of honours 3. Greater cohort size >> bell curve affects students less 3. You can take double majors too by DA or in the 2nd/3rd year 4. More campus life 5. Can stay in RC/hall etc. 6. For eg. econs is more academic and math inclined 7. World QS ranking The disadvantages of NUS: 1. Must find internships & exchange opportunities via the student (?) office. 2. Heavier and more modules esp for double major students (be prepared). I was offered double majors via DA, I counted 4 more modules for NUS than smu for the same double major combination. 3. More in depth and harder modules than smu (from my senior). 4. Hall/RC life may affect your academics. 5. Less specialisation tracks than smu.  Disclaimer ** What I think is subjective, I don’t mean to offend any NUS/SMU students reading this 😅 This is the summary of my ‘research’ haha xD. I am also deciding between nus and smu. Currently reading some year 1 stuff to see which one I like more I got SMU econs,  NUS FASS DMP and NBS offer tooWow your research is so detailed! Haha  Some things I would like to clarify for the benefit of everyone, which is based on my own knowledge and experience talking to friends across all 3 universities.  First and foremost, please take the employment surveys as a pinch of salt. Your salary won't be guaranteed to be higher just because you are enrolled in a particular university that is reported to have higher gross starting pay. Trust me,  when I was deciding on uni like you guys many years ago, I was affected by the graduate employment survey as well but then after years in uni and finally working,  I realised the survey might be misleading... Just so you know, most of these times when the graduates answer these surveys, the schools don't even check whether the pay you entered is true or not...How much you will get for your starting pay depends on your EXPERIENCE, your GRADES, your NEGOTIATION SKILLS, the ECONOMIC OUTLOOK at that POINT IN TIME,  the INDUSTRY and JOB SCOPE. Which uni honestly doesn't matter, cos all 3 local unis are considered on par to one another in the employers' eyes.  and it's just gross pay. There are other components in a salary package like bonuses and benefits which are not captured in the employment surveys. Some people may have a lower gross pay but may have higher bonuses and benefits (eg more days of leave) than someone with higher gross pay who may have less attractive bonuses and benefits. And many times, these surveys are not even representative of the whole student population as not all 100% of the graduating cohort would have completed the survey. Maybe it's just that small handful of students who did the survey and skewed the data?  regarding the point about students in nus being only able to source for internships from career office... That is not true at all. You can always self source (meaning you apply via websites like linkedin for eg by yourself) Oh and student exchange definitely must apply via student office regardless of whether is it nus ntu or smu... Cos all uni already have a list of overseas exchange partner universities that students can apply to then the student office will facilitate the process lor. The process is more or less the same across all 3 uni de.  And one more thing about nus I thought is worth mentioning, they have this NUS Overseas College (NOC) programme where you get to spend 1 year overseas studying and interning... You get to accumulate overseas work exp and clear modules like exchange as well. And the internships are paid. And there are many countries u can go to via this programme - Europe, Asia, USA. Do look it up. I kinda regretted not going 😭 cos it's such a valuable opportunity esp if u are passionate about entrepreneurship.Even if u are not its fine it's still great overseas exposure and it value adds to your resume! Oh and every school is competitive, not just SMU because regardless of which course or uni you go to, the bell curve is everywhere.  Choose your school based on the curriculum, the non academic opportunities available and the culture. Talk to seniors Or students who are studying in the universities and courses you have in mind to find out more. Talk to the recent students who have just graduated to find out more about the actual employment prospects and salary trends across the various unis and courses.  Hope this helps more people to come to a decision on which school to choose.",14.178989242136945

Agreed on the part for ICT1002 Programming Fundamental, Python is for beginners to learn as var in Python is loosely assign, don't have to care about memory allocation etc. Once student touch C will be another extreme. Memory allocation now is important, assigning var with wrong format and precision will cause C application to crash.

If you are totally new to programming, having ICT1001 supplement these knowledge such as SQL query statement. ICT1001 doesn't teach how to write stored procedure and other more advanced SQL statement such as left join, right join, union etc, while project if you know these trick, it can decrease the burden of writing inefficient codes. Also freeloader in ICT is another problem, playing taichi and act blur not contributing to project while others doing the project, they use the time to study for class test and exam.

Thanks whuttt wrote:  Good news for those borderline cases eyeing NUS " . . . . the plan to award up to 1.25 bonus points (equivalent of one H1 grade) to students applying for their first choice programme. The bonus points, applicable to programmes not requiring a pre-entry interview, will be added to the student’s University Admission Score. " http://news.nus.edu.sg/highlights/nu...on-initiatives NUS applicants to get bonus points for 1st-choice courses Passion for a field of study will count for admission to the National University of Singapore (NUS) from this year. Those applying for a place at NUS will be given 1.25 bonus points for their first choice - equivalent to going from C to B or B to A in an A-level H1 subject. This applies only to courses where entry is based purely on converting a student's grades into points, and not to courses such as medicine and law where students are assessed on their aptitude and interests through interviews. NUS senior deputy president and provost Ho Teck Hua, who announced the move at a press conference on Monday, said NUS analysis of admission data showed the bonus point can make a difference. "Let's say one student with 81 points applies for communications as his first choice, and another with 82 points applies to the same course as his second choice. With the 1.25 points, the student who lists the course as his first choice will get ahead of the person with 82 points," he said. On why NUS decided on the move, he said: "If you have done well and are passionate about a career in business or computing, for example, then we want to say to you that we support your passion." "We want to help you pursue your passion," he said, adding that students passionate about what they study tend to perform better. Professor Ho revealed that, currently, 65 per cent of students given a place in their first-choice course take up the offer, while only 45 per cent of those given their second-choice course do so. Noting NUS graduates' good job prospects, Prof Ho also announced that NUS will be increasing the number of double majors to increase career options for its graduates. "The nature of work is changing very rapidly, and we need to prepare students for a lifetime of diverse careers," he said. He said NUS, which currently offers 94 double major and major-minor combinations, will add another 86 such programmes. "Someone doing data science and entrepreneurship, for example, can go and work for a range of industries in data science, and also go and do a start-up." On top of the double majors, NUS also offers 71 double degrees, 33 joint degrees with partner universities and 24 concurrent degrees. Adding all this, currently 15 per cent of NUS students are trained in more than one discipline. Prof Ho said he hopes half of all NUS students will graduate with knowledge and skills in two different fields, so they will have more job offers to choose from. He also announced two new degree programmes for this year, one in pharmaceutical science and the other in veterinary science. Students taking up the 5 1/2-year concurrent veterinary degree programme will graduate with an NUS degree in life sciences and a Doctor of Veterinary Medicine from the University of Melbourne. NUS, which now offers 230 bond-free merit scholarships, will add 200 more scholarships for the new academic year. Ms Geraldine Tan, 19, welcomed the move by NUS and said it is important for young people to get into a field that excites them. She said: "I really want to study business and maybe go on an overseas college stint as I want to start a social enterprise. Business courses are hard to get into, so I am hoping the bonus points will help me get the edge." Hwa Chong Institution student Hannah Ganesh, 18, said increasing double degree options is good as students can diversify their learning and "challenge themselves".http://www.straitstimes.com/singapor...choice-courses NUS' new offerings BONUS POINTS FOR FIRST CHOICE Students applying to NUS will be given 1.25 bonus points for their first-choice course. This applies only to courses where entry is based purely on students' grades. MORE DOUBLE MAJORS NUS will be increasing the number of double majors to open up more career options for its graduates. It currently offers 94 double major and major-minor combinations and will add another 86 such programmes. NEW DEGREES A new concurrent degree combines NUS' Bachelor of Science and the Doctor of Veterinary Medicine offered by the University of Melbourne. Students can complete the programmes in 5-1/2 years. NUS is also offering a new joint degree in pharmaceutical science with the University of Dundee in Scotland. The programme is designed to provide students with knowledge and skills for careers in the pharmaceutical, biomedical and consumer healthcare sectors. NUS OVERSEAS COLLEGES The programme that sends students on internships to several entrepreneurial hubs in the world will be extended to Jakarta and Toronto.

Totally agree with you that scholarship should not be awarded based on academic performance only, which I did mention in my earlier post. The primary objective of my earlier post aims to encourage individuals who are currently applying/appealing for admission and/or scholarship - through the sharing of my education journey and the challenges experienced as an individual with a disadvantaged background. Subsequently, the post also seeks to highlight the flaws in the basis of selection for the scholarship interview. Today, institutions are still using a uniform assessment method to evaluate people of diverse backgrounds. The assessment for academic potential is pretty straightforward - cGPA, awards, and other academic achievement obtained from other sources (e.g. competitions, courses, etc.). The tricky part lies in the assessment of non-academic components - institutions seek individuals with certain attributes, qualities, and skills (e.g. leadership, teamwork, entrepreneurship, integrity, sports achievement, etc.). And often, institutions only consider school-related activities and/or co-curricular activities as the samples for their assessment.  On a personal note, I believed that those attributes, qualities, and skillscould also beidentified and assessed through employment experience (e.g. customers' testimonials, appraisals by superiors, awards attained, etc.).  In general, institutions should also look beyond the school-related activities and co-curricular activities when assessing the non-academic components of individuals. Hence, granting more flexibility for underprivileged students whose non-academic profile were considered as "insubstantial" and thereby allowing  them to have the opportunity to share their stories. Ultimately, an interview is all we need.P.s. I'm glad that your hard work paid off, and congrats on securing that scholarship offered by a private company  (I missed the application deadline for private & government scholarship ) To be shortlisted for interview on the government scholarship with 3.5GPA, you must have some really outstanding non-academic achievements! Do you mind to share with us? And hello senior , assuming you are an SMU student (based on the GPA capped at 4.0). As an individual with similar experience, juggling between full-time work and study is really no joke, not to mention that you are doing it at the University-level and still managed to scored a decent grade. Mind to share what full-time job you work as? Do you study in the day, and work at night/after-school hours? Did you, perhaps, packed all modules into that few days so that you could work for the rest of the days in the week?

Before your comments get lost in the sea of comments on this very active forum, let me reply to your rant/concerns. I just want to say that I get you. I totally do. Why? I was once in your position last year. Unknowingly fell into depression during the waiting period from April to May because I waited hopelessly for things that eventually (and obviously) did not come true... Exactly 1 year ago on this date (13 April 2017), I received a devastating offer from NTU — environmental engineering, and that was my last choice. It was supposed to be a celebration, that I received an offer, but it was the absolute last thing I wanted, since it wasn't my first choice, and something that I knew I couldn't accept doing (and was stupid enough to even place it in my choices, ah well).  Subsequently I got rejected by NUS and SMU, because I simply didn't make the cut... With a heavy heart I signed up (late) for private A levels, and as much as I hated the idea of having to retake, having to suffer... I had no choice. I really wanted to prove to myself that I CAN get into local uni. It didn't help when I'm from one of the top JCs, and my friends are moving on happily to overseas unis with unconditional offers, scholarships, or medicine, law, dentistry... you name it. I was utterly alone. And I felt like I was the only loser in my school (and also a disgrace to my school) who had to retake A levels, who couldn't really make the cut for local uni. In the end, ALL my appeals failed. What's new? Reality slapped me hard in the face, and it hurt like a bitch, of course. What could I do? I had to move on. I then spent some time correcting my mindset before I was actually more mentally stable for my exams. But I just have to tell you that you are really doing yourself a huge disfavour right now. Yes you are disappointed, you are not receiving news, everything seems oh so damn hopeless. But self pity will only kill you, as well as the people around you who love and care for you... do know that YOU are not the only one suffering, your family and friends are too! Everything seems bleak right now yes, but once you get that offer, everything will be merry and bright...  For me, I knew that I wanted to go to uni. I spent that one more year not just preparing for retake, but also redefining my goals and aspirations in my life. Also, building on my character. Depression no more! There were many sacrifices made, many times that I felt like hiding in a cave... but I overcame that and grew so much stronger. As long as you YEARN it, you will get it no matter what, because no one can stop you!! So don't even let the demons in your head stop you, please do not give in to depression. No one can help you except yourself. I suggest you try meditation and yoga, those things saved my ass (': And here I am back this year, legitly exactly one year later. I received my offer from NTU business...... It took one more year, but it was so worth it. Although my story might not be the most impressive one, but I've proved to everyone and most importantly myself that if I want something, I'm gonna make sure I get it, even if it means one year later. Because this is my future, and I am the captain of my ship of fate. I hope that you realise this too, be proud of who you are, of your battlescars, failures and experiences. All these will shape you into who you are — a better you. Chin up!! ",14.834825498793322

I heard from a senior in fass that 1 module in fass is about 1 lecture & 1 tutorial per week btw. The benefits of smu: 1. You get to interact and actively engage yourself during lessons. 2. More internship and exchange opportunities than nus. 3. Many students take double majors and more % taking double degree. 4. More specialisation tracks. 5. Higher employment and salary on average according to the employment survey. The downsides of smu: 1. Competition in smu is fierce. 2. Less campus life (in terms of hall etc) 3. The % of honours students there is lower than fass as it is harder to achieve honours in smu. 4. Less opportunities to make friends (Depends on your personality) The advantages of fass: 1. Lecture-tutorial style of learning, good for shy students who prefer mugging in a corner 2. Higher % of honours 3. Greater cohort size >> bell curve affects students less 3. You can take double majors too by DA or in the 2nd/3rd year 4. More campus life 5. Can stay in RC/hall etc. 6. For eg. econs is more academic and math inclined 7. World QS ranking The disadvantages of NUS: 1. Must find internships & exchange opportunities via the student (?) office. 2. Heavier and more modules esp for double major students (be prepared). I was offered double majors via DA, I counted 4 more modules for NUS than smu for the same double major combination. 3. More in depth and harder modules than smu (from my senior). 4. Hall/RC life may affect your academics. 5. Less specialisation tracks than smu.  Disclaimer ** What I think is subjective, I don’t mean to offend any NUS/SMU students reading this 😅 This is the summary of my ‘research’ haha xD. I am also deciding between nus and smu. Currently reading some year 1 stuff to see which one I like more I got SMU econs,  NUS FASS DMP and NBS offer tooWow your research is so detailed! Haha  Some things I would like to clarify for the benefit of everyone, which is based on my own knowledge and experience talking to friends across all 3 universities.  First and foremost, please take the employment surveys as a pinch of salt. Your salary won't be guaranteed to be higher just because you are enrolled in a particular university that is reported to have higher gross starting pay. Trust me,  when I was deciding on uni like you guys many years ago, I was affected by the graduate employment survey as well but then after years in uni and finally working,  I realised the survey might be misleading... Just so you know, most of these times when the graduates answer these surveys, the schools don't even check whether the pay you entered is true or not...How much you will get for your starting pay depends on your EXPERIENCE, your GRADES, your NEGOTIATION SKILLS, the ECONOMIC OUTLOOK at that POINT IN TIME,  the INDUSTRY and JOB SCOPE. Which uni honestly doesn't matter, cos all 3 local unis are considered on par to one another in the employers' eyes.  and it's just gross pay. There are other components in a salary package like bonuses and benefits which are not captured in the employment surveys. Some people may have a lower gross pay but may have higher bonuses and benefits (eg more days of leave) than someone with higher gross pay who may have less attractive bonuses and benefits. And many times, these surveys are not even representative of the whole student population as not all 100% of the graduating cohort would have completed the survey. Maybe it's just that small handful of students who did the survey and skewed the data?  regarding the point about students in nus being only able to source for internships from career office... That is not true at all. You can always self source (meaning you apply via websites like linkedin for eg by yourself) Oh and student exchange definitely must apply via student office regardless of whether is it nus ntu or smu... Cos all uni already have a list of overseas exchange partner universities that students can apply to then the student office will facilitate the process lor. The process is more or less the same across all 3 uni de.  And one more thing about nus I thought is worth mentioning, they have this NUS Overseas College (NOC) programme where you get to spend 1 year overseas studying and interning... You get to accumulate overseas work exp and clear modules like exchange as well. And the internships are paid. And there are many countries u can go to via this programme - Europe, Asia, USA. Do look it up. I kinda regretted not going 😭 cos it's such a valuable opportunity esp if u are passionate about entrepreneurship.Even if u are not its fine it's still great overseas exposure and it value adds to your resume! Oh and every school is competitive, not just SMU because regardless of which course or uni you go to, the bell curve is everywhere.  Choose your school based on the curriculum, the non academic opportunities available and the culture. Talk to seniors Or students who are studying in the universities and courses you have in mind to find out more. Talk to the recent students who have just graduated to find out more about the actual employment prospects and salary trends across the various unis and courses.  Hope this helps more people to come to a decision on which school to choose.",14.178989242136945

The professors themselves reiterate in the first lecture to tell us not to worry if you have no background because they will teach the basics to you. Agreed on the part for ICT1002 Programming Fundamental, Python is for beginners to learn as var in Python is loosely assign, don't have to care about memory allocation etc. Once student touch C will be another extreme. Memory allocation now is important, assigning var with wrong format and precision will cause C application to crash.

If you are unlucky that 2 of out of 4 teammates not contribute much, you will having the feeling of a sinking boat. Just a project in ICT1004 implement all this different language.  If you are totally new to programming, having ICT1001 supplement these knowledge such as SQL query statement. ICT1001 doesn't teach how to write stored procedure and other more advanced SQL statement such as left join, right join, union etc, while project if you know these trick, it can decrease the burden of writing inefficient codes. Also freeloader in ICT is another problem, playing taichi and act blur not contributing to project while others doing the project, they use the time to study for class test and exam.

Thanks whuttt wrote:  Good news for those borderline cases eyeing NUS " . . . . the plan to award up to 1.25 bonus points (equivalent of one H1 grade) to students applying for their first choice programme. The bonus points, applicable to programmes not requiring a pre-entry interview, will be added to the student’s University Admission Score. " http://news.nus.edu.sg/highlights/nu...on-initiatives NUS applicants to get bonus points for 1st-choice courses Passion for a field of study will count for admission to the National University of Singapore (NUS) from this year. Those applying for a place at NUS will be given 1.25 bonus points for their first choice - equivalent to going from C to B or B to A in an A-level H1 subject. This applies only to courses where entry is based purely on converting a student's grades into points, and not to courses such as medicine and law where students are assessed on their aptitude and interests through interviews. NUS senior deputy president and provost Ho Teck Hua, who announced the move at a press conference on Monday, said NUS analysis of admission data showed the bonus point can make a difference. "Let's say one student with 81 points applies for communications as his first choice, and another with 82 points applies to the same course as his second choice. With the 1.25 points, the student who lists the course as his first choice will get ahead of the person with 82 points," he said. On why NUS decided on the move, he said: "If you have done well and are passionate about a career in business or computing, for example, then we want to say to you that we support your passion." "We want to help you pursue your passion," he said, adding that students passionate about what they study tend to perform better. Professor Ho revealed that, currently, 65 per cent of students given a place in their first-choice course take up the offer, while only 45 per cent of those given their second-choice course do so. Noting NUS graduates' good job prospects, Prof Ho also announced that NUS will be increasing the number of double majors to increase career options for its graduates. "The nature of work is changing very rapidly, and we need to prepare students for a lifetime of diverse careers," he said. He said NUS, which currently offers 94 double major and major-minor combinations, will add another 86 such programmes. "Someone doing data science and entrepreneurship, for example, can go and work for a range of industries in data science, and also go and do a start-up." On top of the double majors, NUS also offers 71 double degrees, 33 joint degrees with partner universities and 24 concurrent degrees. Adding all this, currently 15 per cent of NUS students are trained in more than one discipline. Prof Ho said he hopes half of all NUS students will graduate with knowledge and skills in two different fields, so they will have more job offers to choose from. He also announced two new degree programmes for this year, one in pharmaceutical science and the other in veterinary science. Students taking up the 5 1/2-year concurrent veterinary degree programme will graduate with an NUS degree in life sciences and a Doctor of Veterinary Medicine from the University of Melbourne. NUS, which now offers 230 bond-free merit scholarships, will add 200 more scholarships for the new academic year. Ms Geraldine Tan, 19, welcomed the move by NUS and said it is important for young people to get into a field that excites them. She said: "I really want to study business and maybe go on an overseas college stint as I want to start a social enterprise. Business courses are hard to get into, so I am hoping the bonus points will help me get the edge." Hwa Chong Institution student Hannah Ganesh, 18, said increasing double degree options is good as students can diversify their learning and "challenge themselves".http://www.straitstimes.com/singapor...choice-courses NUS' new offerings BONUS POINTS FOR FIRST CHOICE Students applying to NUS will be given 1.25 bonus points for their first-choice course. This applies only to courses where entry is based purely on students' grades. MORE DOUBLE MAJORS NUS will be increasing the number of double majors to open up more career options for its graduates. It currently offers 94 double major and major-minor combinations and will add another 86 such programmes. NEW DEGREES A new concurrent degree combines NUS' Bachelor of Science and the Doctor of Veterinary Medicine offered by the University of Melbourne. Students can complete the programmes in 5-1/2 years. NUS is also offering a new joint degree in pharmaceutical science with the University of Dundee in Scotland. The programme is designed to provide students with knowledge and skills for careers in the pharmaceutical, biomedical and consumer healthcare sectors. NUS OVERSEAS COLLEGES The programme that sends students on internships to several entrepreneurial hubs in the world will be extended to Jakarta and Toronto.

Totally agree with you that scholarship should not be awarded based on academic performance only, which I did mention in my earlier post. The primary objective of my earlier post aims to encourage individuals who are currently applying/appealing for admission and/or scholarship - through the sharing of my education journey and the challenges experienced as an individual with a disadvantaged background. Subsequently, the post also seeks to highlight the flaws in the basis of selection for the scholarship interview. Today, institutions are still using a uniform assessment method to evaluate people of diverse backgrounds. The assessment for academic potential is pretty straightforward - cGPA, awards, and other academic achievement obtained from other sources (e.g. competitions, courses, etc.). The tricky part lies in the assessment of non-academic components - institutions seek individuals with certain attributes, qualities, and skills (e.g. leadership, teamwork, entrepreneurship, integrity, sports achievement, etc.). And often, institutions only consider school-related activities and/or co-curricular activities as the samples for their assessment.  On a personal note, I believed that those attributes, qualities, and skillscould also beidentified and assessed through employment experience (e.g. customers' testimonials, appraisals by superiors, awards attained, etc.).  In general, institutions should also look beyond the school-related activities and co-curricular activities when assessing the non-academic components of individuals. Hence, granting more flexibility for underprivileged students whose non-academic profile were considered as "insubstantial" and thereby allowing  them to have the opportunity to share their stories. Ultimately, an interview is all we need.P.s. I'm glad that your hard work paid off, and congrats on securing that scholarship offered by a private company  (I missed the application deadline for private & government scholarship ) To be shortlisted for interview on the government scholarship with 3.5GPA, you must have some really outstanding non-academic achievements! Do you mind to share with us? And hello senior , assuming you are an SMU student (based on the GPA capped at 4.0). As an individual with similar experience, juggling between full-time work and study is really no joke, not to mention that you are doing it at the University-level and still managed to scored a decent grade. Mind to share what full-time job you work as? Do you study in the day, and work at night/after-school hours? Did you, perhaps, packed all modules into that few days so that you could work for the rest of the days in the week?

You can say there's still time but I just can't take waiting up to 3 agonizing more months later. If anything, the only realistic thing in life that will ever happen is me writing that appeal letter. Before your comments get lost in the sea of comments on this very active forum, let me reply to your rant/concerns. I just want to say that I get you. I totally do. Why? I was once in your position last year. Unknowingly fell into depression during the waiting period from April to May because I waited hopelessly for things that eventually (and obviously) did not come true... Exactly 1 year ago on this date (13 April 2017), I received a devastating offer from NTU — environmental engineering, and that was my last choice. It was supposed to be a celebration, that I received an offer, but it was the absolute last thing I wanted, since it wasn't my first choice, and something that I knew I couldn't accept doing (and was stupid enough to even place it in my choices, ah well).  Subsequently I got rejected by NUS and SMU, because I simply didn't make the cut... With a heavy heart I signed up (late) for private A levels, and as much as I hated the idea of having to retake, having to suffer... I had no choice. I really wanted to prove to myself that I CAN get into local uni. It didn't help when I'm from one of the top JCs, and my friends are moving on happily to overseas unis with unconditional offers, scholarships, or medicine, law, dentistry... you name it. I was utterly alone. And I felt like I was the only loser in my school (and also a disgrace to my school) who had to retake A levels, who couldn't really make the cut for local uni. In the end, ALL my appeals failed. What's new? Reality slapped me hard in the face, and it hurt like a bitch, of course. What could I do? I had to move on. I then spent some time correcting my mindset before I was actually more mentally stable for my exams. But I just have to tell you that you are really doing yourself a huge disfavour right now. Yes you are disappointed, you are not receiving news, everything seems oh so damn hopeless. But self pity will only kill you, as well as the people around you who love and care for you... do know that YOU are not the only one suffering, your family and friends are too! Everything seems bleak right now yes, but once you get that offer, everything will be merry and bright...  For me, I knew that I wanted to go to uni. I spent that one more year not just preparing for retake, but also redefining my goals and aspirations in my life. Also, building on my character. Depression no more! There were many sacrifices made, many times that I felt like hiding in a cave... but I overcame that and grew so much stronger. As long as you YEARN it, you will get it no matter what, because no one can stop you!! So don't even let the demons in your head stop you, please do not give in to depression. No one can help you except yourself. I suggest you try meditation and yoga, those things saved my ass (': And here I am back this year, legitly exactly one year later. I received my offer from NTU business...... It took one more year, but it was so worth it. Although my story might not be the most impressive one, but I've proved to everyone and most importantly myself that if I want something, I'm gonna make sure I get it, even if it means one year later. Because this is my future, and I am the captain of my ship of fate. I hope that you realise this too, be proud of who you are, of your battlescars, failures and experiences. All these will shape you into who you are — a better you. Chin up!! ",14.834825498793322

I heard from a senior in fass that 1 module in fass is about 1 lecture & 1 tutorial per week btw. The benefits of smu: 1. You get to interact and actively engage yourself during lessons. 2. More internship and exchange opportunities than nus. 3. Many students take double majors and more % taking double degree. 4. More specialisation tracks. 5. Higher employment and salary on average according to the employment survey. The downsides of smu: 1. Competition in smu is fierce. 2. Less campus life (in terms of hall etc) 3. The % of honours students there is lower than fass as it is harder to achieve honours in smu. 4. Less opportunities to make friends (Depends on your personality) The advantages of fass: 1. Lecture-tutorial style of learning, good for shy students who prefer mugging in a corner 2. Higher % of honours 3. Greater cohort size >> bell curve affects students less 3. You can take double majors too by DA or in the 2nd/3rd year 4. More campus life 5. Can stay in RC/hall etc. 6. For eg. econs is more academic and math inclined 7. World QS ranking The disadvantages of NUS: 1. Must find internships & exchange opportunities via the student (?) office. 2. Heavier and more modules esp for double major students (be prepared). I was offered double majors via DA, I counted 4 more modules for NUS than smu for the same double major combination. 3. More in depth and harder modules than smu (from my senior). 4. Hall/RC life may affect your academics. 5. Less specialisation tracks than smu.  Disclaimer ** What I think is subjective, I don’t mean to offend any NUS/SMU students reading this 😅 This is the summary of my ‘research’ haha xD. I am also deciding between nus and smu. Currently reading some year 1 stuff to see which one I like more I got SMU econs,  NUS FASS DMP and NBS offer tooWow your research is so detailed! Haha  Some things I would like to clarify for the benefit of everyone, which is based on my own knowledge and experience talking to friends across all 3 universities.  First and foremost, please take the employment surveys as a pinch of salt. Your salary won't be guaranteed to be higher just because you are enrolled in a particular university that is reported to have higher gross starting pay. Trust me,  when I was deciding on uni like you guys many years ago, I was affected by the graduate employment survey as well but then after years in uni and finally working,  I realised the survey might be misleading... Just so you know, most of these times when the graduates answer these surveys, the schools don't even check whether the pay you entered is true or not...How much you will get for your starting pay depends on your EXPERIENCE, your GRADES, your NEGOTIATION SKILLS, the ECONOMIC OUTLOOK at that POINT IN TIME,  the INDUSTRY and JOB SCOPE. Which uni honestly doesn't matter, cos all 3 local unis are considered on par to one another in the employers' eyes.  and it's just gross pay. There are other components in a salary package like bonuses and benefits which are not captured in the employment surveys. Some people may have a lower gross pay but may have higher bonuses and benefits (eg more days of leave) than someone with higher gross pay who may have less attractive bonuses and benefits. And many times, these surveys are not even representative of the whole student population as not all 100% of the graduating cohort would have completed the survey. Maybe it's just that small handful of students who did the survey and skewed the data?  regarding the point about students in nus being only able to source for internships from career office... That is not true at all. You can always self source (meaning you apply via websites like linkedin for eg by yourself) Oh and student exchange definitely must apply via student office regardless of whether is it nus ntu or smu... Cos all uni already have a list of overseas exchange partner universities that students can apply to then the student office will facilitate the process lor. The process is more or less the same across all 3 uni de.  And one more thing about nus I thought is worth mentioning, they have this NUS Overseas College (NOC) programme where you get to spend 1 year overseas studying and interning... You get to accumulate overseas work exp and clear modules like exchange as well. And the internships are paid. And there are many countries u can go to via this programme - Europe, Asia, USA. Do look it up. I kinda regretted not going 😭 cos it's such a valuable opportunity esp if u are passionate about entrepreneurship.Even if u are not its fine it's still great overseas exposure and it value adds to your resume! Oh and every school is competitive, not just SMU because regardless of which course or uni you go to, the bell curve is everywhere.  Choose your school based on the curriculum, the non academic opportunities available and the culture. Talk to seniors Or students who are studying in the universities and courses you have in mind to find out more. Talk to the recent students who have just graduated to find out more about the actual employment prospects and salary trends across the various unis and courses.  Hope this helps more people to come to a decision on which school to choose.",14.178989242136945

The professors themselves reiterate in the first lecture to tell us not to worry if you have no background because they will teach the basics to you. Agreed on the part for ICT1002 Programming Fundamental, Python is for beginners to learn as var in Python is loosely assign, don't have to care about memory allocation etc. Once student touch C will be another extreme. Memory allocation now is important, assigning var with wrong format and precision will cause C application to crash.

If you are unlucky that 2 of out of 4 teammates not contribute much, you will having the feeling of a sinking boat. Just a project in ICT1004 implement all this different language.  If you are totally new to programming, having ICT1001 supplement these knowledge such as SQL query statement. ICT1001 doesn't teach how to write stored procedure and other more advanced SQL statement such as left join, right join, union etc, while project if you know these trick, it can decrease the burden of writing inefficient codes. Also freeloader in ICT is another problem, playing taichi and act blur not contributing to project while others doing the project, they use the time to study for class test and exam.

Thanks whuttt wrote:  Good news for those borderline cases eyeing NUS " . . . . the plan to award up to 1.25 bonus points (equivalent of one H1 grade) to students applying for their first choice programme. The bonus points, applicable to programmes not requiring a pre-entry interview, will be added to the student’s University Admission Score. " http://news.nus.edu.sg/highlights/nu...on-initiatives NUS applicants to get bonus points for 1st-choice courses Passion for a field of study will count for admission to the National University of Singapore (NUS) from this year. Those applying for a place at NUS will be given 1.25 bonus points for their first choice - equivalent to going from C to B or B to A in an A-level H1 subject. This applies only to courses where entry is based purely on converting a student's grades into points, and not to courses such as medicine and law where students are assessed on their aptitude and interests through interviews. NUS senior deputy president and provost Ho Teck Hua, who announced the move at a press conference on Monday, said NUS analysis of admission data showed the bonus point can make a difference. "Let's say one student with 81 points applies for communications as his first choice, and another with 82 points applies to the same course as his second choice. With the 1.25 points, the student who lists the course as his first choice will get ahead of the person with 82 points," he said. On why NUS decided on the move, he said: "If you have done well and are passionate about a career in business or computing, for example, then we want to say to you that we support your passion." "We want to help you pursue your passion," he said, adding that students passionate about what they study tend to perform better. Professor Ho revealed that, currently, 65 per cent of students given a place in their first-choice course take up the offer, while only 45 per cent of those given their second-choice course do so. Noting NUS graduates' good job prospects, Prof Ho also announced that NUS will be increasing the number of double majors to increase career options for its graduates. "The nature of work is changing very rapidly, and we need to prepare students for a lifetime of diverse careers," he said. He said NUS, which currently offers 94 double major and major-minor combinations, will add another 86 such programmes. "Someone doing data science and entrepreneurship, for example, can go and work for a range of industries in data science, and also go and do a start-up." On top of the double majors, NUS also offers 71 double degrees, 33 joint degrees with partner universities and 24 concurrent degrees. Adding all this, currently 15 per cent of NUS students are trained in more than one discipline. Prof Ho said he hopes half of all NUS students will graduate with knowledge and skills in two different fields, so they will have more job offers to choose from. He also announced two new degree programmes for this year, one in pharmaceutical science and the other in veterinary science. Students taking up the 5 1/2-year concurrent veterinary degree programme will graduate with an NUS degree in life sciences and a Doctor of Veterinary Medicine from the University of Melbourne. NUS, which now offers 230 bond-free merit scholarships, will add 200 more scholarships for the new academic year. Ms Geraldine Tan, 19, welcomed the move by NUS and said it is important for young people to get into a field that excites them. She said: "I really want to study business and maybe go on an overseas college stint as I want to start a social enterprise. Business courses are hard to get into, so I am hoping the bonus points will help me get the edge." Hwa Chong Institution student Hannah Ganesh, 18, said increasing double degree options is good as students can diversify their learning and "challenge themselves".http://www.straitstimes.com/singapor...choice-courses NUS' new offerings BONUS POINTS FOR FIRST CHOICE Students applying to NUS will be given 1.25 bonus points for their first-choice course.

It currently offers 94 double major and major-minor combinations and will add another 86 such programmes. NEW DEGREES A new concurrent degree combines NUS' Bachelor of Science and the Doctor of Veterinary Medicine offered by the University of Melbourne. Students can complete the programmes in 5-1/2 years. NUS is also offering a new joint degree in pharmaceutical science with the University of Dundee in Scotland. The programme is designed to provide students with knowledge and skills for careers in the pharmaceutical, biomedical and consumer healthcare sectors. NUS OVERSEAS COLLEGES The programme that sends students on internships to several entrepreneurial hubs in the world will be extended to Jakarta and Toronto.

Totally agree with you that scholarship should not be awarded based on academic performance only, which I did mention in my earlier post. The primary objective of my earlier post aims to encourage individuals who are currently applying/appealing for admission and/or scholarship - through the sharing of my education journey and the challenges experienced as an individual with a disadvantaged background. Subsequently, the post also seeks to highlight the flaws in the basis of selection for the scholarship interview. Today, institutions are still using a uniform assessment method to evaluate people of diverse backgrounds. The assessment for academic potential is pretty straightforward - cGPA, awards, and other academic achievement obtained from other sources (e.g. competitions, courses, etc.). The tricky part lies in the assessment of non-academic components - institutions seek individuals with certain attributes, qualities, and skills (e.g. leadership, teamwork, entrepreneurship, integrity, sports achievement, etc.). And often, institutions only consider school-related activities and/or co-curricular activities as the samples for their assessment.  On a personal note, I believed that those attributes, qualities, and skillscould also beidentified and assessed through employment experience (e.g. customers' testimonials, appraisals by superiors, awards attained, etc.).  In general, institutions should also look beyond the school-related activities and co-curricular activities when assessing the non-academic components of individuals. Hence, granting more flexibility for underprivileged students whose non-academic profile were considered as "insubstantial" and thereby allowing  them to have the opportunity to share their stories. Ultimately, an interview is all we need.P.s. I'm glad that your hard work paid off, and congrats on securing that scholarship offered by a private company  (I missed the application deadline for private & government scholarship ) To be shortlisted for interview on the government scholarship with 3.5GPA, you must have some really outstanding non-academic achievements! Do you mind to share with us? And hello senior , assuming you are an SMU student (based on the GPA capped at 4.0). As an individual with similar experience, juggling between full-time work and study is really no joke, not to mention that you are doing it at the University-level and still managed to scored a decent grade. Mind to share what full-time job you work as? Do you study in the day, and work at night/after-school hours? Did you, perhaps, packed all modules into that few days so that you could work for the rest of the days in the week? Sincerely hope that you can share some tips with us/me Networking/cloud computing consultant.

Coming from a disadvantaged background, I spent most of my time working to facilitate personal living expenses as well as to contribute to the family's finances. And with most of the time spent on work (e.g. after-school hours, weekends, and vacation periods), my investment in non-academic activities (e.g. CCA, competitions, etc.) was limited to 8 hours per week and would often have to give up on activities such as YEP and OIP due to the cost and time involved. Therefore, my non-academic profile was considered to be "insubstantial" in comparison with other individuals who had the resources to be a full-time student. Whilst there is nothing wrong with awarding scholarships primarily on academic achievement, the current selection criteria and system may be further skewed against lower-income households, as their children may have less in the areas of co-curricular activities, leadership track record, etc, because of their limited financial resources. This may further stack the odds against the lower-income, who have fewer resources to access tuition, enrichment programmes, learning aids, etc. The irony of how institutions used a uniform assessment method to evaluate people of diverse backgrounds - the subtle ways colleges discriminate against poor students  Ultimately, life is fair because the world is unfair to everyone  Heng (lucky) still can apply for financial aid  Woah!

And with most of the time spent on work (e.g. after-school hours, weekends, and vacation periods), my investment in non-academic activities (e.g. CCA, competitions, etc.) was limited to 8 hours per week and would often have to give up on activities such as YEP and OIP due to the cost and time involved. Therefore, my non-academic profile was considered to be "insubstantial" in comparison with other individuals who had the resources to be a full-time student. Whilst there is nothing wrong with awarding scholarships primarily on academic achievement, the current selection criteria and system may be further skewed against lower-income households, as their children may have less in the areas of co-curricular activities, leadership track record, etc, because of their limited financial resources. This may further stack the odds against the lower-income, who have fewer resources to access tuition, enrichment programmes, learning aids, etc. The irony of how institutions used a uniform assessment method to evaluate people of diverse backgrounds - the subtle ways colleges discriminate against poor students  Ultimately, life is fair because the world is unfair to everyone  Heng (lucky) still can apply for financial aid Little Angry Potato wrote:  3.97.

SMU rejected me or on waiting list now. Prepared so much in the topic but apparently not on the dress code or speaking enough like an ang moh. I was the only one that came in jeans and sneakers while everyone else were wearing formal. Is that overdress or what's to be expected? (I don't get why the email even said smart casual, but I just followed the email...) NTU and NUS completely ignoring me forever. I've gotten so depressed I'm no longer depressed. Perhaps this is one way of curing yourself of depression: where everything becomes a delusion and nothing in life matters anymore. It sucks that everything to form a judgment on someone can just be based on a single event on a single day and nothing else, but well, that's life. You can say there's still time but I just can't take waiting up to 3 agonizing more months later. If anything, the only realistic thing in life that will ever happen is me writing that appeal letter. Before your comments get lost in the sea of comments on this very active forum, let me reply to your rant/concerns. I just want to say that I get you. I totally do. Why? I was once in your position last year. Unknowingly fell into depression during the waiting period from April to May because I waited hopelessly for things that eventually (and obviously) did not come true... Exactly 1 year ago on this date (13 April 2017), I received a devastating offer from NTU — environmental engineering, and that was my last choice. It was supposed to be a celebration, that I received an offer, but it was the absolute last thing I wanted, since it wasn't my first choice, and something that I knew I couldn't accept doing (and was stupid enough to even place it in my choices, ah well).  Subsequently I got rejected by NUS and SMU, because I simply didn't make the cut... With a heavy heart I signed up (late) for private A levels, and as much as I hated the idea of having to retake, having to suffer... I had no choice. I really wanted to prove to myself that I CAN get into local uni. It didn't help when I'm from one of the top JCs, and my friends are moving on happily to overseas unis with unconditional offers, scholarships, or medicine, law, dentistry... you name it. I was utterly alone. And I felt like I was the only loser in my school (and also a disgrace to my school) who had to retake A levels, who couldn't really make the cut for local uni. In the end, ALL my appeals failed. What's new? Reality slapped me hard in the face, and it hurt like a bitch, of course. What could I do? I had to move on. I then spent some time correcting my mindset before I was actually more mentally stable for my exams. But I just have to tell you that you are really doing yourself a huge disfavour right now. Yes you are disappointed, you are not receiving news, everything seems oh so damn hopeless. But self pity will only kill you, as well as the people around you who love and care for you... do know that YOU are not the only one suffering, your family and friends are too! Everything seems bleak right now yes, but once you get that offer, everything will be merry and bright...  For me, I knew that I wanted to go to uni. I spent that one more year not just preparing for retake, but also redefining my goals and aspirations in my life. Also, building on my character. Depression no more! There were many sacrifices made, many times that I felt like hiding in a cave... but I overcame that and grew so much stronger. As long as you YEARN it, you will get it no matter what, because no one can stop you!! So don't even let the demons in your head stop you, please do not give in to depression. No one can help you except yourself. I suggest you try meditation and yoga, those things saved my ass (': And here I am back this year, legitly exactly one year later. I received my offer from NTU business...... It took one more year, but it was so worth it. Although my story might not be the most impressive one, but I've proved to everyone and most importantly myself that if I want something, I'm gonna make sure I get it, even if it means one year later. Because this is my future, and I am the captain of my ship of fate. I hope that you realise this too, be proud of who you are, of your battlescars, failures and experiences. All these will shape you into who you are — a better you. Chin up!! ",14.834825498793322

I heard from a senior in fass that 1 module in fass is about 1 lecture & 1 tutorial per week btw. The benefits of smu: 1. You get to interact and actively engage yourself during lessons. 2. More internship and exchange opportunities than nus. 3. Many students take double majors and more % taking double degree. 4. More specialisation tracks. 5. Higher employment and salary on average according to the employment survey. The downsides of smu: 1. Competition in smu is fierce. 2. Less campus life (in terms of hall etc) 3. The % of honours students there is lower than fass as it is harder to achieve honours in smu. 4. Less opportunities to make friends (Depends on your personality) The advantages of fass: 1. Lecture-tutorial style of learning, good for shy students who prefer mugging in a corner 2. Higher % of honours 3. Greater cohort size >> bell curve affects students less 3. You can take double majors too by DA or in the 2nd/3rd year 4. More campus life 5. Can stay in RC/hall etc. 6. For eg. econs is more academic and math inclined 7. World QS ranking The disadvantages of NUS: 1. Must find internships & exchange opportunities via the student (?) office. 2. Heavier and more modules esp for double major students (be prepared). I was offered double majors via DA, I counted 4 more modules for NUS than smu for the same double major combination. 3. More in depth and harder modules than smu (from my senior). 4. Hall/RC life may affect your academics. 5. Less specialisation tracks than smu.  Disclaimer ** What I think is subjective, I don’t mean to offend any NUS/SMU students reading this 😅 This is the summary of my ‘research’ haha xD. I am also deciding between nus and smu. Currently reading some year 1 stuff to see which one I like more I got SMU econs,  NUS FASS DMP and NBS offer tooWow your research is so detailed! Haha  Some things I would like to clarify for the benefit of everyone, which is based on my own knowledge and experience talking to friends across all 3 universities.  First and foremost, please take the employment surveys as a pinch of salt. Your salary won't be guaranteed to be higher just because you are enrolled in a particular university that is reported to have higher gross starting pay. Trust me,  when I was deciding on uni like you guys many years ago, I was affected by the graduate employment survey as well but then after years in uni and finally working,  I realised the survey might be misleading... Just so you know, most of these times when the graduates answer these surveys, the schools don't even check whether the pay you entered is true or not...How much you will get for your starting pay depends on your EXPERIENCE, your GRADES, your NEGOTIATION SKILLS, the ECONOMIC OUTLOOK at that POINT IN TIME,  the INDUSTRY and JOB SCOPE. Which uni honestly doesn't matter, cos all 3 local unis are considered on par to one another in the employers' eyes.  and it's just gross pay. There are other components in a salary package like bonuses and benefits which are not captured in the employment surveys. Some people may have a lower gross pay but may have higher bonuses and benefits (eg more days of leave) than someone with higher gross pay who may have less attractive bonuses and benefits. And many times, these surveys are not even representative of the whole student population as not all 100% of the graduating cohort would have completed the survey. Maybe it's just that small handful of students who did the survey and skewed the data?  regarding the point about students in nus being only able to source for internships from career office... That is not true at all. You can always self source (meaning you apply via websites like linkedin for eg by yourself) Oh and student exchange definitely must apply via student office regardless of whether is it nus ntu or smu... Cos all uni already have a list of overseas exchange partner universities that students can apply to then the student office will facilitate the process lor. The process is more or less the same across all 3 uni de.  And one more thing about nus I thought is worth mentioning, they have this NUS Overseas College (NOC) programme where you get to spend 1 year overseas studying and interning... You get to accumulate overseas work exp and clear modules like exchange as well. And the internships are paid. And there are many countries u can go to via this programme - Europe, Asia, USA. Do look it up. I kinda regretted not going 😭 cos it's such a valuable opportunity esp if u are passionate about entrepreneurship.Even if u are not its fine it's still great overseas exposure and it value adds to your resume! Oh and every school is competitive, not just SMU because regardless of which course or uni you go to, the bell curve is everywhere.  Choose your school based on the curriculum, the non academic opportunities available and the culture. Talk to seniors Or students who are studying in the universities and courses you have in mind to find out more. Talk to the recent students who have just graduated to find out more about the actual employment prospects and salary trends across the various unis and courses.  Hope this helps more people to come to a decision on which school to choose.",14.178989242136945

The professors themselves reiterate in the first lecture to tell us not to worry if you have no background because they will teach the basics to you. Agreed on the part for ICT1002 Programming Fundamental, Python is for beginners to learn as var in Python is loosely assign, don't have to care about memory allocation etc. Once student touch C will be another extreme. Memory allocation now is important, assigning var with wrong format and precision will cause C application to crash.

If you are totally new to programming, having ICT1001 supplement these knowledge such as SQL query statement. ICT1001 doesn't teach how to write stored procedure and other more advanced SQL statement such as left join, right join, union etc, while project if you know these trick, it can decrease the burden of writing inefficient codes.

The bonus points, applicable to programmes not requiring a pre-entry interview, will be added to the student’s University Admission Score. " http://news.nus.edu.sg/highlights/nu...on-initiatives NUS applicants to get bonus points for 1st-choice courses Passion for a field of study will count for admission to the National University of Singapore (NUS) from this year. Those applying for a place at NUS will be given 1.25 bonus points for their first choice - equivalent to going from C to B or B to A in an A-level H1 subject. This applies only to courses where entry is based purely on converting a student's grades into points, and not to courses such as medicine and law where students are assessed on their aptitude and interests through interviews. NUS senior deputy president and provost Ho Teck Hua, who announced the move at a press conference on Monday, said NUS analysis of admission data showed the bonus point can make a difference. "Let's say one student with 81 points applies for communications as his first choice, and another with 82 points applies to the same course as his second choice. With the 1.25 points, the student who lists the course as his first choice will get ahead of the person with 82 points," he said. On why NUS decided on the move, he said: "If you have done well and are passionate about a career in business or computing, for example, then we want to say to you that we support your passion." "We want to help you pursue your passion," he said, adding that students passionate about what they study tend to perform better. Professor Ho revealed that, currently, 65 per cent of students given a place in their first-choice course take up the offer, while only 45 per cent of those given their second-choice course do so. Noting NUS graduates' good job prospects, Prof Ho also announced that NUS will be increasing the number of double majors to increase career options for its graduates. "The nature of work is changing very rapidly, and we need to prepare students for a lifetime of diverse careers," he said. He said NUS, which currently offers 94 double major and major-minor combinations, will add another 86 such programmes. "Someone doing data science and entrepreneurship, for example, can go and work for a range of industries in data science, and also go and do a start-up." On top of the double majors, NUS also offers 71 double degrees, 33 joint degrees with partner universities and 24 concurrent degrees. Adding all this, currently 15 per cent of NUS students are trained in more than one discipline. Prof Ho said he hopes half of all NUS students will graduate with knowledge and skills in two different fields, so they will have more job offers to choose from. He also announced two new degree programmes for this year, one in pharmaceutical science and the other in veterinary science. Students taking up the 5 1/2-year concurrent veterinary degree programme will graduate with an NUS degree in life sciences and a Doctor of Veterinary Medicine from the University of Melbourne. NUS, which now offers 230 bond-free merit scholarships, will add 200 more scholarships for the new academic year. Ms Geraldine Tan, 19, welcomed the move by NUS and said it is important for young people to get into a field that excites them. She said: "I really want to study business and maybe go on an overseas college stint as I want to start a social enterprise. Business courses are hard to get into, so I am hoping the bonus points will help me get the edge." Hwa Chong Institution student Hannah Ganesh, 18, said increasing double degree options is good as students can diversify their learning and "challenge themselves".http://www.straitstimes.com/singapor...choice-courses NUS' new offerings BONUS POINTS FOR FIRST CHOICE Students applying to NUS will be given 1.25 bonus points for their first-choice course.

NEW DEGREES A new concurrent degree combines NUS' Bachelor of Science and the Doctor of Veterinary Medicine offered by the University of Melbourne. Students can complete the programmes in 5-1/2 years. NUS is also offering a new joint degree in pharmaceutical science with the University of Dundee in Scotland. The programme is designed to provide students with knowledge and skills for careers in the pharmaceutical, biomedical and consumer healthcare sectors.

Totally agree with you that scholarship should not be awarded based on academic performance only, which I did mention in my earlier post. The primary objective of my earlier post aims to encourage individuals who are currently applying/appealing for admission and/or scholarship - through the sharing of my education journey and the challenges experienced as an individual with a disadvantaged background. Subsequently, the post also seeks to highlight the flaws in the basis of selection for the scholarship interview. Today, institutions are still using a uniform assessment method to evaluate people of diverse backgrounds. The assessment for academic potential is pretty straightforward - cGPA, awards, and other academic achievement obtained from other sources (e.g. competitions, courses, etc.). The tricky part lies in the assessment of non-academic components - institutions seek individuals with certain attributes, qualities, and skills (e.g. leadership, teamwork, entrepreneurship, integrity, sports achievement, etc.). And often, institutions only consider school-related activities and/or co-curricular activities as the samples for their assessment.  On a personal note, I believed that those attributes, qualities, and skillscould also beidentified and assessed through employment experience (e.g. customers' testimonials, appraisals by superiors, awards attained, etc.).  In general, institutions should also look beyond the school-related activities and co-curricular activities when assessing the non-academic components of individuals. Hence, granting more flexibility for underprivileged students whose non-academic profile were considered as "insubstantial" and thereby allowing  them to have the opportunity to share their stories. Ultimately, an interview is all we need.P.s. I'm glad that your hard work paid off, and congrats on securing that scholarship offered by a private company  (I missed the application deadline for private & government scholarship ) To be shortlisted for interview on the government scholarship with 3.5GPA, you must have some really outstanding non-academic achievements! Do you mind to share with us? And hello senior , assuming you are an SMU student (based on the GPA capped at 4.0). As an individual with similar experience, juggling between full-time work and study is really no joke, not to mention that you are doing it at the University-level and still managed to scored a decent grade. Mind to share what full-time job you work as? Do you study in the day, and work at night/after-school hours? Did you, perhaps, packed all modules into that few days so that you could work for the rest of the days in the week?

I know its tough, but instead of feeling sorry for yourself, channel that energy into something positive, productive. You got rejected for business or whatever right. Move on, start thinking what you CAN do instead of leaving things up to fate and worrying over things you cant control. If business is your end goal, start thinking of alternatives; for example maybe taking economica or an arts course but majoring in business and then perhaps appealing for transfer etc, or writing that appeal letter. You can make life alot harder for yourself by focusing on the negative stuff, or to make an excuse for why things didnt go your way. Learn from them, its a choice, YOUR choice.

Before your comments get lost in the sea of comments on this very active forum, let me reply to your rant/concerns. I just want to say that I get you. I totally do. Why? I was once in your position last year. Unknowingly fell into depression during the waiting period from April to May because I waited hopelessly for things that eventually (and obviously) did not come true... Exactly 1 year ago on this date (13 April 2017), I received a devastating offer from NTU — environmental engineering, and that was my last choice. It was supposed to be a celebration, that I received an offer, but it was the absolute last thing I wanted, since it wasn't my first choice, and something that I knew I couldn't accept doing (and was stupid enough to even place it in my choices, ah well).  Subsequently I got rejected by NUS and SMU, because I simply didn't make the cut... With a heavy heart I signed up (late) for private A levels, and as much as I hated the idea of having to retake, having to suffer... I had no choice. I really wanted to prove to myself that I CAN get into local uni. It didn't help when I'm from one of the top JCs, and my friends are moving on happily to overseas unis with unconditional offers, scholarships, or medicine, law, dentistry... you name it. I was utterly alone. And I felt like I was the only loser in my school (and also a disgrace to my school) who had to retake A levels, who couldn't really make the cut for local uni. In the end, ALL my appeals failed. What's new? Reality slapped me hard in the face, and it hurt like a bitch, of course. What could I do? I had to move on. I then spent some time correcting my mindset before I was actually more mentally stable for my exams. But I just have to tell you that you are really doing yourself a huge disfavour right now. Yes you are disappointed, you are not receiving news, everything seems oh so damn hopeless. But self pity will only kill you, as well as the people around you who love and care for you... do know that YOU are not the only one suffering, your family and friends are too! Everything seems bleak right now yes, but once you get that offer, everything will be merry and bright...  For me, I knew that I wanted to go to uni. I spent that one more year not just preparing for retake, but also redefining my goals and aspirations in my life. Also, building on my character. Depression no more! There were many sacrifices made, many times that I felt like hiding in a cave... but I overcame that and grew so much stronger. As long as you YEARN it, you will get it no matter what, because no one can stop you!! So don't even let the demons in your head stop you, please do not give in to depression. No one can help you except yourself. I suggest you try meditation and yoga, those things saved my ass (': And here I am back this year, legitly exactly one year later. I received my offer from NTU business...... It took one more year, but it was so worth it. Although my story might not be the most impressive one, but I've proved to everyone and most importantly myself that if I want something, I'm gonna make sure I get it, even if it means one year later. Because this is my future, and I am the captain of my ship of fate. I hope that you realise this too, be proud of who you are, of your battlescars, failures and experiences. All these will shape you into who you are — a better you. Chin up!! ",14.834825498793322

I heard from a senior in fass that 1 module in fass is about 1 lecture & 1 tutorial per week btw. The benefits of smu: 1. You get to interact and actively engage yourself during lessons. 2. More internship and exchange opportunities than nus. 3. Many students take double majors and more % taking double degree. 4. More specialisation tracks. 5. Higher employment and salary on average according to the employment survey. The downsides of smu: 1. Competition in smu is fierce. 2. Less campus life (in terms of hall etc) 3. The % of honours students there is lower than fass as it is harder to achieve honours in smu. 4. Less opportunities to make friends (Depends on your personality) The advantages of fass: 1. Lecture-tutorial style of learning, good for shy students who prefer mugging in a corner 2. Higher % of honours 3. Greater cohort size >> bell curve affects students less 3. You can take double majors too by DA or in the 2nd/3rd year 4. More campus life 5. Can stay in RC/hall etc. 6. For eg. econs is more academic and math inclined 7. World QS ranking The disadvantages of NUS: 1. Must find internships & exchange opportunities via the student (?) office. 2. Heavier and more modules esp for double major students (be prepared). I was offered double majors via DA, I counted 4 more modules for NUS than smu for the same double major combination. 3. More in depth and harder modules than smu (from my senior). 4. Hall/RC life may affect your academics. 5. Less specialisation tracks than smu.  Disclaimer ** What I think is subjective, I don’t mean to offend any NUS/SMU students reading this 😅 This is the summary of my ‘research’ haha xD. I am also deciding between nus and smu. Currently reading some year 1 stuff to see which one I like more I got SMU econs,  NUS FASS DMP and NBS offer tooWow your research is so detailed! Haha  Some things I would like to clarify for the benefit of everyone, which is based on my own knowledge and experience talking to friends across all 3 universities.  First and foremost, please take the employment surveys as a pinch of salt. Your salary won't be guaranteed to be higher just because you are enrolled in a particular university that is reported to have higher gross starting pay. Trust me,  when I was deciding on uni like you guys many years ago, I was affected by the graduate employment survey as well but then after years in uni and finally working,  I realised the survey might be misleading... Just so you know, most of these times when the graduates answer these surveys, the schools don't even check whether the pay you entered is true or not...How much you will get for your starting pay depends on your EXPERIENCE, your GRADES, your NEGOTIATION SKILLS, the ECONOMIC OUTLOOK at that POINT IN TIME,  the INDUSTRY and JOB SCOPE. Which uni honestly doesn't matter, cos all 3 local unis are considered on par to one another in the employers' eyes.  and it's just gross pay. There are other components in a salary package like bonuses and benefits which are not captured in the employment surveys. Some people may have a lower gross pay but may have higher bonuses and benefits (eg more days of leave) than someone with higher gross pay who may have less attractive bonuses and benefits. And many times, these surveys are not even representative of the whole student population as not all 100% of the graduating cohort would have completed the survey. Maybe it's just that small handful of students who did the survey and skewed the data?  regarding the point about students in nus being only able to source for internships from career office... That is not true at all. You can always self source (meaning you apply via websites like linkedin for eg by yourself) Oh and student exchange definitely must apply via student office regardless of whether is it nus ntu or smu... Cos all uni already have a list of overseas exchange partner universities that students can apply to then the student office will facilitate the process lor. The process is more or less the same across all 3 uni de.  And one more thing about nus I thought is worth mentioning, they have this NUS Overseas College (NOC) programme where you get to spend 1 year overseas studying and interning... You get to accumulate overseas work exp and clear modules like exchange as well. And the internships are paid. And there are many countries u can go to via this programme - Europe, Asia, USA. Do look it up. I kinda regretted not going 😭 cos it's such a valuable opportunity esp if u are passionate about entrepreneurship.Even if u are not its fine it's still great overseas exposure and it value adds to your resume! Oh and every school is competitive, not just SMU because regardless of which course or uni you go to, the bell curve is everywhere.  Choose your school based on the curriculum, the non academic opportunities available and the culture. Talk to seniors Or students who are studying in the universities and courses you have in mind to find out more. Talk to the recent students who have just graduated to find out more about the actual employment prospects and salary trends across the various unis and courses.  Hope this helps more people to come to a decision on which school to choose.",14.178989242136945

Agreed on the part for ICT1002 Programming Fundamental, Python is for beginners to learn as var in Python is loosely assign, don't have to care about memory allocation etc. Once student touch C will be another extreme. Memory allocation now is important, assigning var with wrong format and precision will cause C application to crash.

If you are totally new to programming, having ICT1001 supplement these knowledge such as SQL query statement. ICT1001 doesn't teach how to write stored procedure and other more advanced SQL statement such as left join, right join, union etc, while project if you know these trick, it can decrease the burden of writing inefficient codes.

The bonus points, applicable to programmes not requiring a pre-entry interview, will be added to the student’s University Admission Score. " http://news.nus.edu.sg/highlights/nu...on-initiatives NUS applicants to get bonus points for 1st-choice courses Passion for a field of study will count for admission to the National University of Singapore (NUS) from this year. Those applying for a place at NUS will be given 1.25 bonus points for their first choice - equivalent to going from C to B or B to A in an A-level H1 subject. This applies only to courses where entry is based purely on converting a student's grades into points, and not to courses such as medicine and law where students are assessed on their aptitude and interests through interviews. NUS senior deputy president and provost Ho Teck Hua, who announced the move at a press conference on Monday, said NUS analysis of admission data showed the bonus point can make a difference. "Let's say one student with 81 points applies for communications as his first choice, and another with 82 points applies to the same course as his second choice. With the 1.25 points, the student who lists the course as his first choice will get ahead of the person with 82 points," he said. On why NUS decided on the move, he said: "If you have done well and are passionate about a career in business or computing, for example, then we want to say to you that we support your passion." "We want to help you pursue your passion," he said, adding that students passionate about what they study tend to perform better. Professor Ho revealed that, currently, 65 per cent of students given a place in their first-choice course take up the offer, while only 45 per cent of those given their second-choice course do so. Noting NUS graduates' good job prospects, Prof Ho also announced that NUS will be increasing the number of double majors to increase career options for its graduates. "The nature of work is changing very rapidly, and we need to prepare students for a lifetime of diverse careers," he said. He said NUS, which currently offers 94 double major and major-minor combinations, will add another 86 such programmes. "Someone doing data science and entrepreneurship, for example, can go and work for a range of industries in data science, and also go and do a start-up." On top of the double majors, NUS also offers 71 double degrees, 33 joint degrees with partner universities and 24 concurrent degrees. Adding all this, currently 15 per cent of NUS students are trained in more than one discipline. Prof Ho said he hopes half of all NUS students will graduate with knowledge and skills in two different fields, so they will have more job offers to choose from. He also announced two new degree programmes for this year, one in pharmaceutical science and the other in veterinary science. Students taking up the 5 1/2-year concurrent veterinary degree programme will graduate with an NUS degree in life sciences and a Doctor of Veterinary Medicine from the University of Melbourne. NUS, which now offers 230 bond-free merit scholarships, will add 200 more scholarships for the new academic year. Ms Geraldine Tan, 19, welcomed the move by NUS and said it is important for young people to get into a field that excites them. She said: "I really want to study business and maybe go on an overseas college stint as I want to start a social enterprise. Business courses are hard to get into, so I am hoping the bonus points will help me get the edge." Hwa Chong Institution student Hannah Ganesh, 18, said increasing double degree options is good as students can diversify their learning and "challenge themselves".http://www.straitstimes.com/singapor...choice-courses NUS' new offerings BONUS POINTS FOR FIRST CHOICE Students applying to NUS will be given 1.25 bonus points for their first-choice course. This applies only to courses where entry is based purely on students' grades. MORE DOUBLE MAJORS NUS will be increasing the number of double majors to open up more career options for its graduates. It currently offers 94 double major and major-minor combinations and will add another 86 such programmes. NEW DEGREES A new concurrent degree combines NUS' Bachelor of Science and the Doctor of Veterinary Medicine offered by the University of Melbourne. Students can complete the programmes in 5-1/2 years. NUS is also offering a new joint degree in pharmaceutical science with the University of Dundee in Scotland. The programme is designed to provide students with knowledge and skills for careers in the pharmaceutical, biomedical and consumer healthcare sectors.

Totally agree with you that scholarship should not be awarded based on academic performance only, which I did mention in my earlier post. The primary objective of my earlier post aims to encourage individuals who are currently applying/appealing for admission and/or scholarship - through the sharing of my education journey and the challenges experienced as an individual with a disadvantaged background. Subsequently, the post also seeks to highlight the flaws in the basis of selection for the scholarship interview. Today, institutions are still using a uniform assessment method to evaluate people of diverse backgrounds. The assessment for academic potential is pretty straightforward - cGPA, awards, and other academic achievement obtained from other sources (e.g. competitions, courses, etc.). The tricky part lies in the assessment of non-academic components - institutions seek individuals with certain attributes, qualities, and skills (e.g. leadership, teamwork, entrepreneurship, integrity, sports achievement, etc.). And often, institutions only consider school-related activities and/or co-curricular activities as the samples for their assessment.  On a personal note, I believed that those attributes, qualities, and skillscould also beidentified and assessed through employment experience (e.g. customers' testimonials, appraisals by superiors, awards attained, etc.).  In general, institutions should also look beyond the school-related activities and co-curricular activities when assessing the non-academic components of individuals. Hence, granting more flexibility for underprivileged students whose non-academic profile were considered as "insubstantial" and thereby allowing  them to have the opportunity to share their stories. Ultimately, an interview is all we need.P.s. I'm glad that your hard work paid off, and congrats on securing that scholarship offered by a private company  (I missed the application deadline for private & government scholarship ) To be shortlisted for interview on the government scholarship with 3.5GPA, you must have some really outstanding non-academic achievements! Do you mind to share with us? And hello senior , assuming you are an SMU student (based on the GPA capped at 4.0). As an individual with similar experience, juggling between full-time work and study is really no joke, not to mention that you are doing it at the University-level and still managed to scored a decent grade. Mind to share what full-time job you work as? Do you study in the day, and work at night/after-school hours? Did you, perhaps, packed all modules into that few days so that you could work for the rest of the days in the week? Sincerely hope that you can share some tips with us/me Networking/cloud computing consultant. And if you can get some really well-known individual in the industry to write recommendation letter would really be helpful.

If business is your end goal, start thinking of alternatives; for example maybe taking economica or an arts course but majoring in business and then perhaps appealing for transfer etc, or writing that appeal letter. You can make life alot harder for yourself by focusing on the negative stuff, or to make an excuse for why things didnt go your way. Learn from them, its a choice, YOUR choice.

Before your comments get lost in the sea of comments on this very active forum, let me reply to your rant/concerns. I just want to say that I get you. I totally do. Why? I was once in your position last year. Unknowingly fell into depression during the waiting period from April to May because I waited hopelessly for things that eventually (and obviously) did not come true... Exactly 1 year ago on this date (13 April 2017), I received a devastating offer from NTU — environmental engineering, and that was my last choice. It was supposed to be a celebration, that I received an offer, but it was the absolute last thing I wanted, since it wasn't my first choice, and something that I knew I couldn't accept doing (and was stupid enough to even place it in my choices, ah well).  Subsequently I got rejected by NUS and SMU, because I simply didn't make the cut... With a heavy heart I signed up (late) for private A levels, and as much as I hated the idea of having to retake, having to suffer... I had no choice. I really wanted to prove to myself that I CAN get into local uni. It didn't help when I'm from one of the top JCs, and my friends are moving on happily to overseas unis with unconditional offers, scholarships, or medicine, law, dentistry... you name it. I was utterly alone. And I felt like I was the only loser in my school (and also a disgrace to my school) who had to retake A levels, who couldn't really make the cut for local uni. In the end, ALL my appeals failed. What's new? Reality slapped me hard in the face, and it hurt like a bitch, of course. What could I do? I had to move on. I then spent some time correcting my mindset before I was actually more mentally stable for my exams. But I just have to tell you that you are really doing yourself a huge disfavour right now. Yes you are disappointed, you are not receiving news, everything seems oh so damn hopeless. But self pity will only kill you, as well as the people around you who love and care for you... do know that YOU are not the only one suffering, your family and friends are too! Everything seems bleak right now yes, but once you get that offer, everything will be merry and bright...  For me, I knew that I wanted to go to uni. I spent that one more year not just preparing for retake, but also redefining my goals and aspirations in my life. Also, building on my character. Depression no more! There were many sacrifices made, many times that I felt like hiding in a cave... but I overcame that and grew so much stronger. As long as you YEARN it, you will get it no matter what, because no one can stop you!! So don't even let the demons in your head stop you, please do not give in to depression. No one can help you except yourself. I suggest you try meditation and yoga, those things saved my ass (': And here I am back this year, legitly exactly one year later. I received my offer from NTU business...... It took one more year, but it was so worth it. Although my story might not be the most impressive one, but I've proved to everyone and most importantly myself that if I want something, I'm gonna make sure I get it, even if it means one year later. Because this is my future, and I am the captain of my ship of fate. I hope that you realise this too, be proud of who you are, of your battlescars, failures and experiences. All these will shape you into who you are — a better you. Chin up!! ",14.834825498793322

I heard from a senior in fass that 1 module in fass is about 1 lecture & 1 tutorial per week btw. The benefits of smu: 1. You get to interact and actively engage yourself during lessons. 2. More internship and exchange opportunities than nus. 3. Many students take double majors and more % taking double degree. 4. More specialisation tracks. 5. Higher employment and salary on average according to the employment survey. The downsides of smu: 1. Competition in smu is fierce. 2. Less campus life (in terms of hall etc) 3. The % of honours students there is lower than fass as it is harder to achieve honours in smu. 4. Less opportunities to make friends (Depends on your personality) The advantages of fass: 1. Lecture-tutorial style of learning, good for shy students who prefer mugging in a corner 2. Higher % of honours 3. Greater cohort size >> bell curve affects students less 3. You can take double majors too by DA or in the 2nd/3rd year 4. More campus life 5. Can stay in RC/hall etc. 6. For eg. econs is more academic and math inclined 7. World QS ranking The disadvantages of NUS: 1. Must find internships & exchange opportunities via the student (?) office. 2. Heavier and more modules esp for double major students (be prepared). I was offered double majors via DA, I counted 4 more modules for NUS than smu for the same double major combination. 3. More in depth and harder modules than smu (from my senior). 4. Hall/RC life may affect your academics. 5. Less specialisation tracks than smu.  Disclaimer ** What I think is subjective, I don’t mean to offend any NUS/SMU students reading this 😅 This is the summary of my ‘research’ haha xD. I am also deciding between nus and smu. Currently reading some year 1 stuff to see which one I like more I got SMU econs,  NUS FASS DMP and NBS offer tooWow your research is so detailed! Haha  Some things I would like to clarify for the benefit of everyone, which is based on my own knowledge and experience talking to friends across all 3 universities.  First and foremost, please take the employment surveys as a pinch of salt. Your salary won't be guaranteed to be higher just because you are enrolled in a particular university that is reported to have higher gross starting pay. Trust me,  when I was deciding on uni like you guys many years ago, I was affected by the graduate employment survey as well but then after years in uni and finally working,  I realised the survey might be misleading... Just so you know, most of these times when the graduates answer these surveys, the schools don't even check whether the pay you entered is true or not...How much you will get for your starting pay depends on your EXPERIENCE, your GRADES, your NEGOTIATION SKILLS, the ECONOMIC OUTLOOK at that POINT IN TIME,  the INDUSTRY and JOB SCOPE. Which uni honestly doesn't matter, cos all 3 local unis are considered on par to one another in the employers' eyes.  and it's just gross pay. There are other components in a salary package like bonuses and benefits which are not captured in the employment surveys. Some people may have a lower gross pay but may have higher bonuses and benefits (eg more days of leave) than someone with higher gross pay who may have less attractive bonuses and benefits. And many times, these surveys are not even representative of the whole student population as not all 100% of the graduating cohort would have completed the survey. Maybe it's just that small handful of students who did the survey and skewed the data?  regarding the point about students in nus being only able to source for internships from career office... That is not true at all. You can always self source (meaning you apply via websites like linkedin for eg by yourself) Oh and student exchange definitely must apply via student office regardless of whether is it nus ntu or smu... Cos all uni already have a list of overseas exchange partner universities that students can apply to then the student office will facilitate the process lor. The process is more or less the same across all 3 uni de.  And one more thing about nus I thought is worth mentioning, they have this NUS Overseas College (NOC) programme where you get to spend 1 year overseas studying and interning... You get to accumulate overseas work exp and clear modules like exchange as well. And the internships are paid. And there are many countries u can go to via this programme - Europe, Asia, USA. Do look it up. I kinda regretted not going 😭 cos it's such a valuable opportunity esp if u are passionate about entrepreneurship.Even if u are not its fine it's still great overseas exposure and it value adds to your resume! Oh and every school is competitive, not just SMU because regardless of which course or uni you go to, the bell curve is everywhere.  Choose your school based on the curriculum, the non academic opportunities available and the culture. Talk to seniors Or students who are studying in the universities and courses you have in mind to find out more. Talk to the recent students who have just graduated to find out more about the actual employment prospects and salary trends across the various unis and courses.  Hope this helps more people to come to a decision on which school to choose.",14.178989242136945

Yes the director said that. Yes the deadlines are like that.  But, noone said you can't submit projects early. Also this is university. Anyone who expects projects to be scoped to only what is learnt in lectures needs a wake up call. Also, the fear mongering here is a little overdone. Its all about the aptitude for absorbing information. I know a guy from an unrelated diploma with 0 coding knowledge on track for first class while a 3.6 it diploma person is struggling to pass. I come from a decent secondary school. 80% of my class went to A levels. Majority dont even consider SIT. Those good enough to go to NTU SMU NUS SUTD will go there instead. The students in ICT right now are basically guinea pigs. Its a risk they dont have to take.  For those that don't do well enough probably don't like studying altogether and would rather go to sim for a faster degree or will choose to retake a levels. That leaves us with the ones that do badly for A levels and are desperate to get into a 'local uni' without wasting time. Its not surprising that these people end up getting rejected after being interviewed. Edit: One thing that I need to mention is the program is in NO WAY designed that you NEED to know how to code before coming. Saying so is discrediting the professors that work hard to design the program.  The ramp up is fast I admit, but thats the nature of computer science ask anyone in nus/ntu comp sci or smu is, they will tell you the same thing. The first semester subject starts the knowledge train from SCRATCH. If you don't believe me, ask the famous yanying/guyz92 to send you the first few lectures for 1002, which module title is literally programming fundamentals.  I challenge anyone who has seen that to tell me that its not meant for someone with 0 background in coding. The professors themselves reiterate in the first lecture to tell us not to worry if you have no background because they will teach the basics to you. Agreed on the part for ICT1002 Programming Fundamental, Python is for beginners to learn as var in Python is loosely assign, don't have to care about memory allocation etc. Once student touch C will be another extreme. Memory allocation now is important, assigning var with wrong format and precision will cause C application to crash. For ICT1004, given 4 weeks to create a scheduling system in PHP, SQL, CSS3,HTML5 following the semantic requirements, JavaScript/jQuery. If you are unlucky that 2 of out of 4 teammates not contribute much, you will having the feeling of a sinking boat. Just a project in ICT1004 implement all this different language.  If you are totally new to programming, having ICT1001 supplement these knowledge such as SQL query statement. ICT1001 doesn't teach how to write stored procedure and other more advanced SQL statement such as left join, right join, union etc, while project if you know these trick, it can decrease the burden of writing inefficient codes. Also freeloader in ICT is another problem, playing taichi and act blur not contributing to project while others doing the project, they use the time to study for class test and exam. Also known as "being carried". During exam for the first trimester, some wrote C code in PHP question, PHP code in Python question, Python code in JavaScript. You will have the confusion especially when you do not have the IDE to highlight code error.",13.706856187467574

Thanks whuttt wrote:  Good news for those borderline cases eyeing NUS " . . . . the plan to award up to 1.25 bonus points (equivalent of one H1 grade) to students applying for their first choice programme. The bonus points, applicable to programmes not requiring a pre-entry interview, will be added to the student’s University Admission Score. " http://news.nus.edu.sg/highlights/nu...on-initiatives NUS applicants to get bonus points for 1st-choice courses Passion for a field of study will count for admission to the National University of Singapore (NUS) from this year. Those applying for a place at NUS will be given 1.25 bonus points for their first choice - equivalent to going from C to B or B to A in an A-level H1 subject. This applies only to courses where entry is based purely on converting a student's grades into points, and not to courses such as medicine and law where students are assessed on their aptitude and interests through interviews. NUS senior deputy president and provost Ho Teck Hua, who announced the move at a press conference on Monday, said NUS analysis of admission data showed the bonus point can make a difference. "Let's say one student with 81 points applies for communications as his first choice, and another with 82 points applies to the same course as his second choice. With the 1.25 points, the student who lists the course as his first choice will get ahead of the person with 82 points," he said. On why NUS decided on the move, he said: "If you have done well and are passionate about a career in business or computing, for example, then we want to say to you that we support your passion." "We want to help you pursue your passion," he said, adding that students passionate about what they study tend to perform better. Professor Ho revealed that, currently, 65 per cent of students given a place in their first-choice course take up the offer, while only 45 per cent of those given their second-choice course do so. Noting NUS graduates' good job prospects, Prof Ho also announced that NUS will be increasing the number of double majors to increase career options for its graduates. "The nature of work is changing very rapidly, and we need to prepare students for a lifetime of diverse careers," he said. He said NUS, which currently offers 94 double major and major-minor combinations, will add another 86 such programmes. "Someone doing data science and entrepreneurship, for example, can go and work for a range of industries in data science, and also go and do a start-up." On top of the double majors, NUS also offers 71 double degrees, 33 joint degrees with partner universities and 24 concurrent degrees. Adding all this, currently 15 per cent of NUS students are trained in more than one discipline. Prof Ho said he hopes half of all NUS students will graduate with knowledge and skills in two different fields, so they will have more job offers to choose from. He also announced two new degree programmes for this year, one in pharmaceutical science and the other in veterinary science. Students taking up the 5 1/2-year concurrent veterinary degree programme will graduate with an NUS degree in life sciences and a Doctor of Veterinary Medicine from the University of Melbourne. NUS, which now offers 230 bond-free merit scholarships, will add 200 more scholarships for the new academic year. Ms Geraldine Tan, 19, welcomed the move by NUS and said it is important for young people to get into a field that excites them. She said: "I really want to study business and maybe go on an overseas college stint as I want to start a social enterprise. Business courses are hard to get into, so I am hoping the bonus points will help me get the edge." Hwa Chong Institution student Hannah Ganesh, 18, said increasing double degree options is good as students can diversify their learning and "challenge themselves".http://www.straitstimes.com/singapor...choice-courses NUS' new offerings BONUS POINTS FOR FIRST CHOICE Students applying to NUS will be given 1.25 bonus points for their first-choice course. This applies only to courses where entry is based purely on students' grades. MORE DOUBLE MAJORS NUS will be increasing the number of double majors to open up more career options for its graduates. It currently offers 94 double major and major-minor combinations and will add another 86 such programmes. NEW DEGREES A new concurrent degree combines NUS' Bachelor of Science and the Doctor of Veterinary Medicine offered by the University of Melbourne. Students can complete the programmes in 5-1/2 years. NUS is also offering a new joint degree in pharmaceutical science with the University of Dundee in Scotland. The programme is designed to provide students with knowledge and skills for careers in the pharmaceutical, biomedical and consumer healthcare sectors.

The reason for this is they design the program in such a way that you need to know how to code before enroll to the program. ICT SE and IS is very intensive, beginners will have a hard time to catch up. For example, one of our project is to write a web crawler and do data analysis and come out application(s) in C++, it must complete within 4 weeks. Those who have zero programming background will suffer very badly. The lecture slides only teach you how to sit, but project expect you to fly. We have other project running concurrently, including class test. Once project submission is up, next week (two days later) our first exam paper. ICT student with a different perspective here. Yes the director said that. Yes the deadlines are like that.  But, noone said you can't submit projects early. Also this is university. Anyone who expects projects to be scoped to only what is learnt in lectures needs a wake up call. Also, the fear mongering here is a little overdone. Its all about the aptitude for absorbing information. I know a guy from an unrelated diploma with 0 coding knowledge on track for first class while a 3.6 it diploma person is struggling to pass. I come from a decent secondary school. 80% of my class went to A levels. Majority dont even consider SIT. Those good enough to go to NTU SMU NUS SUTD will go there instead. The students in ICT right now are basically guinea pigs. Its a risk they dont have to take.  For those that don't do well enough probably don't like studying altogether and would rather go to sim for a faster degree or will choose to retake a levels. That leaves us with the ones that do badly for A levels and are desperate to get into a 'local uni' without wasting time. Its not surprising that these people end up getting rejected after being interviewed. Edit: One thing that I need to mention is the program is in NO WAY designed that you NEED to know how to code before coming. Saying so is discrediting the professors that work hard to design the program.  The ramp up is fast I admit, but thats the nature of computer science ask anyone in nus/ntu comp sci or smu is, they will tell you the same thing. The first semester subject starts the knowledge train from SCRATCH.

Totally agree with you that scholarship should not be awarded based on academic performance only, which I did mention in my earlier post. The primary objective of my earlier post aims to encourage individuals who are currently applying/appealing for admission and/or scholarship - through the sharing of my education journey and the challenges experienced as an individual with a disadvantaged background. Subsequently, the post also seeks to highlight the flaws in the basis of selection for the scholarship interview. Today, institutions are still using a uniform assessment method to evaluate people of diverse backgrounds. The assessment for academic potential is pretty straightforward - cGPA, awards, and other academic achievement obtained from other sources (e.g. competitions, courses, etc.). The tricky part lies in the assessment of non-academic components - institutions seek individuals with certain attributes, qualities, and skills (e.g. leadership, teamwork, entrepreneurship, integrity, sports achievement, etc.). And often, institutions only consider school-related activities and/or co-curricular activities as the samples for their assessment.  On a personal note, I believed that those attributes, qualities, and skillscould also beidentified and assessed through employment experience (e.g. customers' testimonials, appraisals by superiors, awards attained, etc.).  In general, institutions should also look beyond the school-related activities and co-curricular activities when assessing the non-academic components of individuals. Hence, granting more flexibility for underprivileged students whose non-academic profile were considered as "insubstantial" and thereby allowing  them to have the opportunity to share their stories. Ultimately, an interview is all we need.P.s. I'm glad that your hard work paid off, and congrats on securing that scholarship offered by a private company  (I missed the application deadline for private & government scholarship ) To be shortlisted for interview on the government scholarship with 3.5GPA, you must have some really outstanding non-academic achievements! Do you mind to share with us? And hello senior , assuming you are an SMU student (based on the GPA capped at 4.0). As an individual with similar experience, juggling between full-time work and study is really no joke, not to mention that you are doing it at the University-level and still managed to scored a decent grade. Mind to share what full-time job you work as? Do you study in the day, and work at night/after-school hours? Did you, perhaps, packed all modules into that few days so that you could work for the rest of the days in the week?

Before your comments get lost in the sea of comments on this very active forum, let me reply to your rant/concerns. I just want to say that I get you. I totally do. Why? I was once in your position last year. Unknowingly fell into depression during the waiting period from April to May because I waited hopelessly for things that eventually (and obviously) did not come true... Exactly 1 year ago on this date (13 April 2017), I received a devastating offer from NTU — environmental engineering, and that was my last choice. It was supposed to be a celebration, that I received an offer, but it was the absolute last thing I wanted, since it wasn't my first choice, and something that I knew I couldn't accept doing (and was stupid enough to even place it in my choices, ah well).  Subsequently I got rejected by NUS and SMU, because I simply didn't make the cut... With a heavy heart I signed up (late) for private A levels, and as much as I hated the idea of having to retake, having to suffer... I had no choice. I really wanted to prove to myself that I CAN get into local uni. It didn't help when I'm from one of the top JCs, and my friends are moving on happily to overseas unis with unconditional offers, scholarships, or medicine, law, dentistry... you name it. I was utterly alone. And I felt like I was the only loser in my school (and also a disgrace to my school) who had to retake A levels, who couldn't really make the cut for local uni. In the end, ALL my appeals failed. What's new? Reality slapped me hard in the face, and it hurt like a bitch, of course. What could I do? I had to move on. I then spent some time correcting my mindset before I was actually more mentally stable for my exams. But I just have to tell you that you are really doing yourself a huge disfavour right now. Yes you are disappointed, you are not receiving news, everything seems oh so damn hopeless. But self pity will only kill you, as well as the people around you who love and care for you... do know that YOU are not the only one suffering, your family and friends are too! Everything seems bleak right now yes, but once you get that offer, everything will be merry and bright...  For me, I knew that I wanted to go to uni. I spent that one more year not just preparing for retake, but also redefining my goals and aspirations in my life. Also, building on my character. Depression no more! There were many sacrifices made, many times that I felt like hiding in a cave... but I overcame that and grew so much stronger. As long as you YEARN it, you will get it no matter what, because no one can stop you!! So don't even let the demons in your head stop you, please do not give in to depression. No one can help you except yourself. I suggest you try meditation and yoga, those things saved my ass (': And here I am back this year, legitly exactly one year later. I received my offer from NTU business...... It took one more year, but it was so worth it. Although my story might not be the most impressive one, but I've proved to everyone and most importantly myself that if I want something, I'm gonna make sure I get it, even if it means one year later. Because this is my future, and I am the captain of my ship of fate. I hope that you realise this too, be proud of who you are, of your battlescars, failures and experiences. All these will shape you into who you are — a better you. Chin up!! ",14.834200248463434

I heard from a senior in fass that 1 module in fass is about 1 lecture & 1 tutorial per week btw. The benefits of smu: 1. You get to interact and actively engage yourself during lessons. 2. More internship and exchange opportunities than nus. 3. Many students take double majors and more % taking double degree. 4. More specialisation tracks. 5. Higher employment and salary on average according to the employment survey. The downsides of smu: 1. Competition in smu is fierce. 2. Less campus life (in terms of hall etc) 3. The % of honours students there is lower than fass as it is harder to achieve honours in smu. 4. Less opportunities to make friends (Depends on your personality) The advantages of fass: 1. Lecture-tutorial style of learning, good for shy students who prefer mugging in a corner 2. Higher % of honours 3. Greater cohort size >> bell curve affects students less 3. You can take double majors too by DA or in the 2nd/3rd year 4. More campus life 5. Can stay in RC/hall etc. 6. For eg. econs is more academic and math inclined 7. World QS ranking The disadvantages of NUS: 1. Must find internships & exchange opportunities via the student (?) office. 2. Heavier and more modules esp for double major students (be prepared). I was offered double majors via DA, I counted 4 more modules for NUS than smu for the same double major combination. 3. More in depth and harder modules than smu (from my senior). 4. Hall/RC life may affect your academics. 5. Less specialisation tracks than smu.  Disclaimer ** What I think is subjective, I don’t mean to offend any NUS/SMU students reading this 😅 This is the summary of my ‘research’ haha xD. I am also deciding between nus and smu. Currently reading some year 1 stuff to see which one I like more I got SMU econs,  NUS FASS DMP and NBS offer tooWow your research is so detailed! Haha  Some things I would like to clarify for the benefit of everyone, which is based on my own knowledge and experience talking to friends across all 3 universities.  First and foremost, please take the employment surveys as a pinch of salt. Your salary won't be guaranteed to be higher just because you are enrolled in a particular university that is reported to have higher gross starting pay. Trust me,  when I was deciding on uni like you guys many years ago, I was affected by the graduate employment survey as well but then after years in uni and finally working,  I realised the survey might be misleading... Just so you know, most of these times when the graduates answer these surveys, the schools don't even check whether the pay you entered is true or not...How much you will get for your starting pay depends on your EXPERIENCE, your GRADES, your NEGOTIATION SKILLS, the ECONOMIC OUTLOOK at that POINT IN TIME,  the INDUSTRY and JOB SCOPE. Which uni honestly doesn't matter, cos all 3 local unis are considered on par to one another in the employers' eyes.  and it's just gross pay. There are other components in a salary package like bonuses and benefits which are not captured in the employment surveys. Some people may have a lower gross pay but may have higher bonuses and benefits (eg more days of leave) than someone with higher gross pay who may have less attractive bonuses and benefits. And many times, these surveys are not even representative of the whole student population as not all 100% of the graduating cohort would have completed the survey. Maybe it's just that small handful of students who did the survey and skewed the data?  regarding the point about students in nus being only able to source for internships from career office... That is not true at all. You can always self source (meaning you apply via websites like linkedin for eg by yourself) Oh and student exchange definitely must apply via student office regardless of whether is it nus ntu or smu... Cos all uni already have a list of overseas exchange partner universities that students can apply to then the student office will facilitate the process lor. The process is more or less the same across all 3 uni de.  And one more thing about nus I thought is worth mentioning, they have this NUS Overseas College (NOC) programme where you get to spend 1 year overseas studying and interning... You get to accumulate overseas work exp and clear modules like exchange as well. And the internships are paid. And there are many countries u can go to via this programme - Europe, Asia, USA. Do look it up. I kinda regretted not going 😭 cos it's such a valuable opportunity esp if u are passionate about entrepreneurship.Even if u are not its fine it's still great overseas exposure and it value adds to your resume! Oh and every school is competitive, not just SMU because regardless of which course or uni you go to, the bell curve is everywhere.  Choose your school based on the curriculum, the non academic opportunities available and the culture. Talk to seniors Or students who are studying in the universities and courses you have in mind to find out more. Talk to the recent students who have just graduated to find out more about the actual employment prospects and salary trends across the various unis and courses.  Hope this helps more people to come to a decision on which school to choose.",14.178645173830716

ICT1001 doesn't teach how to write stored procedure and other more advanced SQL statement such as left join, right join, union etc, while project if you know these trick, it can decrease the burden of writing inefficient codes.

NUS senior deputy president and provost Ho Teck Hua, who announced the move at a press conference on Monday, said NUS analysis of admission data showed the bonus point can make a difference. "Let's say one student with 81 points applies for communications as his first choice, and another with 82 points applies to the same course as his second choice. With the 1.25 points, the student who lists the course as his first choice will get ahead of the person with 82 points," he said. On why NUS decided on the move, he said: "If you have done well and are passionate about a career in business or computing, for example, then we want to say to you that we support your passion." "We want to help you pursue your passion," he said, adding that students passionate about what they study tend to perform better. Professor Ho revealed that, currently, 65 per cent of students given a place in their first-choice course take up the offer, while only 45 per cent of those given their second-choice course do so. Noting NUS graduates' good job prospects, Prof Ho also announced that NUS will be increasing the number of double majors to increase career options for its graduates. "The nature of work is changing very rapidly, and we need to prepare students for a lifetime of diverse careers," he said. He said NUS, which currently offers 94 double major and major-minor combinations, will add another 86 such programmes. "Someone doing data science and entrepreneurship, for example, can go and work for a range of industries in data science, and also go and do a start-up." On top of the double majors, NUS also offers 71 double degrees, 33 joint degrees with partner universities and 24 concurrent degrees. Adding all this, currently 15 per cent of NUS students are trained in more than one discipline. Prof Ho said he hopes half of all NUS students will graduate with knowledge and skills in two different fields, so they will have more job offers to choose from. He also announced two new degree programmes for this year, one in pharmaceutical science and the other in veterinary science. Students taking up the 5 1/2-year concurrent veterinary degree programme will graduate with an NUS degree in life sciences and a Doctor of Veterinary Medicine from the University of Melbourne. NUS, which now offers 230 bond-free merit scholarships, will add 200 more scholarships for the new academic year. Ms Geraldine Tan, 19, welcomed the move by NUS and said it is important for young people to get into a field that excites them. She said: "I really want to study business and maybe go on an overseas college stint as I want to start a social enterprise. Business courses are hard to get into, so I am hoping the bonus points will help me get the edge." Hwa Chong Institution student Hannah Ganesh, 18, said increasing double degree options is good as students can diversify their learning and "challenge themselves".http://www.straitstimes.com/singapor...choice-courses NUS' new offerings BONUS POINTS FOR FIRST CHOICE Students applying to NUS will be given 1.25 bonus points for their first-choice course. This applies only to courses where entry is based purely on students' grades. MORE DOUBLE MAJORS NUS will be increasing the number of double majors to open up more career options for its graduates. It currently offers 94 double major and major-minor combinations and will add another 86 such programmes. NEW DEGREES A new concurrent degree combines NUS' Bachelor of Science and the Doctor of Veterinary Medicine offered by the University of Melbourne. Students can complete the programmes in 5-1/2 years. NUS is also offering a new joint degree in pharmaceutical science with the University of Dundee in Scotland. The programme is designed to provide students with knowledge and skills for careers in the pharmaceutical, biomedical and consumer healthcare sectors. NUS OVERSEAS COLLEGES The programme that sends students on internships to several entrepreneurial hubs in the world will be extended to Jakarta and Toronto. MORE BOND-FREE SCHOLARSHIPS NUS, which now offers 230 bond-free merit scholarships, will add another 200 scholarships in the new academic year. ",12.612603106503585

The reason for this is they design the program in such a way that you need to know how to code before enroll to the program. ICT SE and IS is very intensive, beginners will have a hard time to catch up. For example, one of our project is to write a web crawler and do data analysis and come out application(s) in C++, it must complete within 4 weeks. Those who have zero programming background will suffer very badly. The lecture slides only teach you how to sit, but project expect you to fly. We have other project running concurrently, including class test. Once project submission is up, next week (two days later) our first exam paper. ICT student with a different perspective here. Yes the director said that. Yes the deadlines are like that.  But, noone said you can't submit projects early. Also this is university. Anyone who expects projects to be scoped to only what is learnt in lectures needs a wake up call. Also, the fear mongering here is a little overdone. Its all about the aptitude for absorbing information. I know a guy from an unrelated diploma with 0 coding knowledge on track for first class while a 3.6 it diploma person is struggling to pass. I come from a decent secondary school. 80% of my class went to A levels. Majority dont even consider SIT. Those good enough to go to NTU SMU NUS SUTD will go there instead. The students in ICT right now are basically guinea pigs. Its a risk they dont have to take.  For those that don't do well enough probably don't like studying altogether and would rather go to sim for a faster degree or will choose to retake a levels. That leaves us with the ones that do badly for A levels and are desperate to get into a 'local uni' without wasting time. Its not surprising that these people end up getting rejected after being interviewed. Edit: One thing that I need to mention is the program is in NO WAY designed that you NEED to know how to code before coming. Saying so is discrediting the professors that work hard to design the program.  The ramp up is fast I admit, but thats the nature of computer science ask anyone in nus/ntu comp sci or smu is, they will tell you the same thing. The first semester subject starts the knowledge train from SCRATCH. If you don't believe me, ask the famous yanying/guyz92 to send you the first few lectures for 1002, which module title is literally programming fundamentals.  I challenge anyone who has seen that to tell me that its not meant for someone with 0 background in coding. The professors themselves reiterate in the first lecture to tell us not to worry if you have no background because they will teach the basics to you.",12.605030164051893

Totally agree with you that scholarship should not be awarded based on academic performance only, which I did mention in my earlier post. The primary objective of my earlier post aims to encourage individuals who are currently applying/appealing for admission and/or scholarship - through the sharing of my education journey and the challenges experienced as an individual with a disadvantaged background. Subsequently, the post also seeks to highlight the flaws in the basis of selection for the scholarship interview. Today, institutions are still using a uniform assessment method to evaluate people of diverse backgrounds. The assessment for academic potential is pretty straightforward - cGPA, awards, and other academic achievement obtained from other sources (e.g. competitions, courses, etc.). The tricky part lies in the assessment of non-academic components - institutions seek individuals with certain attributes, qualities, and skills (e.g. leadership, teamwork, entrepreneurship, integrity, sports achievement, etc.). And often, institutions only consider school-related activities and/or co-curricular activities as the samples for their assessment.  On a personal note, I believed that those attributes, qualities, and skillscould also beidentified and assessed through employment experience (e.g. customers' testimonials, appraisals by superiors, awards attained, etc.).  In general, institutions should also look beyond the school-related activities and co-curricular activities when assessing the non-academic components of individuals. Hence, granting more flexibility for underprivileged students whose non-academic profile were considered as "insubstantial" and thereby allowing  them to have the opportunity to share their stories. Ultimately, an interview is all we need.P.s. I'm glad that your hard work paid off, and congrats on securing that scholarship offered by a private company  (I missed the application deadline for private & government scholarship ) To be shortlisted for interview on the government scholarship with 3.5GPA, you must have some really outstanding non-academic achievements! Do you mind to share with us? And hello senior , assuming you are an SMU student (based on the GPA capped at 4.0). As an individual with similar experience, juggling between full-time work and study is really no joke, not to mention that you are doing it at the University-level and still managed to scored a decent grade. Mind to share what full-time job you work as? Do you study in the day, and work at night/after-school hours? Did you, perhaps, packed all modules into that few days so that you could work for the rest of the days in the week? Sincerely hope that you can share some tips with us/me Networking/cloud computing consultant.

Before your comments get lost in the sea of comments on this very active forum, let me reply to your rant/concerns. I just want to say that I get you. I totally do. Why? I was once in your position last year. Unknowingly fell into depression during the waiting period from April to May because I waited hopelessly for things that eventually (and obviously) did not come true... Exactly 1 year ago on this date (13 April 2017), I received a devastating offer from NTU — environmental engineering, and that was my last choice. It was supposed to be a celebration, that I received an offer, but it was the absolute last thing I wanted, since it wasn't my first choice, and something that I knew I couldn't accept doing (and was stupid enough to even place it in my choices, ah well).  Subsequently I got rejected by NUS and SMU, because I simply didn't make the cut... With a heavy heart I signed up (late) for private A levels, and as much as I hated the idea of having to retake, having to suffer... I had no choice. I really wanted to prove to myself that I CAN get into local uni. It didn't help when I'm from one of the top JCs, and my friends are moving on happily to overseas unis with unconditional offers, scholarships, or medicine, law, dentistry... you name it. I was utterly alone. And I felt like I was the only loser in my school (and also a disgrace to my school) who had to retake A levels, who couldn't really make the cut for local uni. In the end, ALL my appeals failed. What's new? Reality slapped me hard in the face, and it hurt like a bitch, of course. What could I do? I had to move on. I then spent some time correcting my mindset before I was actually more mentally stable for my exams. But I just have to tell you that you are really doing yourself a huge disfavour right now. Yes you are disappointed, you are not receiving news, everything seems oh so damn hopeless. But self pity will only kill you, as well as the people around you who love and care for you... do know that YOU are not the only one suffering, your family and friends are too! Everything seems bleak right now yes, but once you get that offer, everything will be merry and bright...  For me, I knew that I wanted to go to uni. I spent that one more year not just preparing for retake, but also redefining my goals and aspirations in my life. Also, building on my character. Depression no more! There were many sacrifices made, many times that I felt like hiding in a cave... but I overcame that and grew so much stronger. As long as you YEARN it, you will get it no matter what, because no one can stop you!! So don't even let the demons in your head stop you, please do not give in to depression. No one can help you except yourself. I suggest you try meditation and yoga, those things saved my ass (': And here I am back this year, legitly exactly one year later. I received my offer from NTU business...... It took one more year, but it was so worth it. Although my story might not be the most impressive one, but I've proved to everyone and most importantly myself that if I want something, I'm gonna make sure I get it, even if it means one year later. Because this is my future, and I am the captain of my ship of fate. I hope that you realise this too, be proud of who you are, of your battlescars, failures and experiences. All these will shape you into who you are — a better you. Chin up!! ",14.834825498793322

I heard from a senior in fass that 1 module in fass is about 1 lecture & 1 tutorial per week btw. The benefits of smu: 1. You get to interact and actively engage yourself during lessons. 2. More internship and exchange opportunities than nus. 3. Many students take double majors and more % taking double degree. 4. More specialisation tracks. 5. Higher employment and salary on average according to the employment survey. The downsides of smu: 1. Competition in smu is fierce. 2. Less campus life (in terms of hall etc) 3. The % of honours students there is lower than fass as it is harder to achieve honours in smu. 4. Less opportunities to make friends (Depends on your personality) The advantages of fass: 1. Lecture-tutorial style of learning, good for shy students who prefer mugging in a corner 2. Higher % of honours 3. Greater cohort size >> bell curve affects students less 3. You can take double majors too by DA or in the 2nd/3rd year 4. More campus life 5. Can stay in RC/hall etc. 6. For eg. econs is more academic and math inclined 7. World QS ranking The disadvantages of NUS: 1. Must find internships & exchange opportunities via the student (?) office. 2. Heavier and more modules esp for double major students (be prepared). I was offered double majors via DA, I counted 4 more modules for NUS than smu for the same double major combination. 3. More in depth and harder modules than smu (from my senior). 4. Hall/RC life may affect your academics. 5. Less specialisation tracks than smu.  Disclaimer ** What I think is subjective, I don’t mean to offend any NUS/SMU students reading this 😅 This is the summary of my ‘research’ haha xD. I am also deciding between nus and smu. Currently reading some year 1 stuff to see which one I like more I got SMU econs,  NUS FASS DMP and NBS offer tooWow your research is so detailed! Haha  Some things I would like to clarify for the benefit of everyone, which is based on my own knowledge and experience talking to friends across all 3 universities.  First and foremost, please take the employment surveys as a pinch of salt. Your salary won't be guaranteed to be higher just because you are enrolled in a particular university that is reported to have higher gross starting pay. Trust me,  when I was deciding on uni like you guys many years ago, I was affected by the graduate employment survey as well but then after years in uni and finally working,  I realised the survey might be misleading... Just so you know, most of these times when the graduates answer these surveys, the schools don't even check whether the pay you entered is true or not...How much you will get for your starting pay depends on your EXPERIENCE, your GRADES, your NEGOTIATION SKILLS, the ECONOMIC OUTLOOK at that POINT IN TIME,  the INDUSTRY and JOB SCOPE. Which uni honestly doesn't matter, cos all 3 local unis are considered on par to one another in the employers' eyes.  and it's just gross pay. There are other components in a salary package like bonuses and benefits which are not captured in the employment surveys. Some people may have a lower gross pay but may have higher bonuses and benefits (eg more days of leave) than someone with higher gross pay who may have less attractive bonuses and benefits. And many times, these surveys are not even representative of the whole student population as not all 100% of the graduating cohort would have completed the survey. Maybe it's just that small handful of students who did the survey and skewed the data?  regarding the point about students in nus being only able to source for internships from career office... That is not true at all. You can always self source (meaning you apply via websites like linkedin for eg by yourself) Oh and student exchange definitely must apply via student office regardless of whether is it nus ntu or smu... Cos all uni already have a list of overseas exchange partner universities that students can apply to then the student office will facilitate the process lor. The process is more or less the same across all 3 uni de.  And one more thing about nus I thought is worth mentioning, they have this NUS Overseas College (NOC) programme where you get to spend 1 year overseas studying and interning... You get to accumulate overseas work exp and clear modules like exchange as well. And the internships are paid. And there are many countries u can go to via this programme - Europe, Asia, USA. Do look it up. I kinda regretted not going 😭 cos it's such a valuable opportunity esp if u are passionate about entrepreneurship.Even if u are not its fine it's still great overseas exposure and it value adds to your resume! Oh and every school is competitive, not just SMU because regardless of which course or uni you go to, the bell curve is everywhere.  Choose your school based on the curriculum, the non academic opportunities available and the culture. Talk to seniors Or students who are studying in the universities and courses you have in mind to find out more. Talk to the recent students who have just graduated to find out more about the actual employment prospects and salary trends across the various unis and courses.  Hope this helps more people to come to a decision on which school to choose.",14.178989242136945

I come from a decent secondary school. 80% of my class went to A levels. Majority dont even consider SIT. Those good enough to go to NTU SMU NUS SUTD will go there instead. The students in ICT right now are basically guinea pigs. Its a risk they dont have to take.  For those that don't do well enough probably don't like studying altogether and would rather go to sim for a faster degree or will choose to retake a levels. That leaves us with the ones that do badly for A levels and are desperate to get into a 'local uni' without wasting time. Its not surprising that these people end up getting rejected after being interviewed. Edit: One thing that I need to mention is the program is in NO WAY designed that you NEED to know how to code before coming. Saying so is discrediting the professors that work hard to design the program.  The ramp up is fast I admit, but thats the nature of computer science ask anyone in nus/ntu comp sci or smu is, they will tell you the same thing. The first semester subject starts the knowledge train from SCRATCH. If you don't believe me, ask the famous yanying/guyz92 to send you the first few lectures for 1002, which module title is literally programming fundamentals.  I challenge anyone who has seen that to tell me that its not meant for someone with 0 background in coding. The professors themselves reiterate in the first lecture to tell us not to worry if you have no background because they will teach the basics to you. Agreed on the part for ICT1002 Programming Fundamental, Python is for beginners to learn as var in Python is loosely assign, don't have to care about memory allocation etc. Once student touch C will be another extreme. Memory allocation now is important, assigning var with wrong format and precision will cause C application to crash. For ICT1004, given 4 weeks to create a scheduling system in PHP, SQL, CSS3,HTML5 following the semantic requirements, JavaScript/jQuery. If you are unlucky that 2 of out of 4 teammates not contribute much, you will having the feeling of a sinking boat. Just a project in ICT1004 implement all this different language.  If you are totally new to programming, having ICT1001 supplement these knowledge such as SQL query statement. ICT1001 doesn't teach how to write stored procedure and other more advanced SQL statement such as left join, right join, union etc, while project if you know these trick, it can decrease the burden of writing inefficient codes. Also freeloader in ICT is another problem, playing taichi and act blur not contributing to project while others doing the project, they use the time to study for class test and exam. Also known as "being carried". During exam for the first trimester, some wrote C code in PHP question, PHP code in Python question, Python code in JavaScript.

Thanks whuttt wrote:  Good news for those borderline cases eyeing NUS " . . . . the plan to award up to 1.25 bonus points (equivalent of one H1 grade) to students applying for their first choice programme. The bonus points, applicable to programmes not requiring a pre-entry interview, will be added to the student’s University Admission Score. " http://news.nus.edu.sg/highlights/nu...on-initiatives NUS applicants to get bonus points for 1st-choice courses Passion for a field of study will count for admission to the National University of Singapore (NUS) from this year. Those applying for a place at NUS will be given 1.25 bonus points for their first choice - equivalent to going from C to B or B to A in an A-level H1 subject. This applies only to courses where entry is based purely on converting a student's grades into points, and not to courses such as medicine and law where students are assessed on their aptitude and interests through interviews. NUS senior deputy president and provost Ho Teck Hua, who announced the move at a press conference on Monday, said NUS analysis of admission data showed the bonus point can make a difference. "Let's say one student with 81 points applies for communications as his first choice, and another with 82 points applies to the same course as his second choice. With the 1.25 points, the student who lists the course as his first choice will get ahead of the person with 82 points," he said. On why NUS decided on the move, he said: "If you have done well and are passionate about a career in business or computing, for example, then we want to say to you that we support your passion." "We want to help you pursue your passion," he said, adding that students passionate about what they study tend to perform better. Professor Ho revealed that, currently, 65 per cent of students given a place in their first-choice course take up the offer, while only 45 per cent of those given their second-choice course do so. Noting NUS graduates' good job prospects, Prof Ho also announced that NUS will be increasing the number of double majors to increase career options for its graduates. "The nature of work is changing very rapidly, and we need to prepare students for a lifetime of diverse careers," he said. He said NUS, which currently offers 94 double major and major-minor combinations, will add another 86 such programmes. "Someone doing data science and entrepreneurship, for example, can go and work for a range of industries in data science, and also go and do a start-up." On top of the double majors, NUS also offers 71 double degrees, 33 joint degrees with partner universities and 24 concurrent degrees. Adding all this, currently 15 per cent of NUS students are trained in more than one discipline. Prof Ho said he hopes half of all NUS students will graduate with knowledge and skills in two different fields, so they will have more job offers to choose from. He also announced two new degree programmes for this year, one in pharmaceutical science and the other in veterinary science. Students taking up the 5 1/2-year concurrent veterinary degree programme will graduate with an NUS degree in life sciences and a Doctor of Veterinary Medicine from the University of Melbourne. NUS, which now offers 230 bond-free merit scholarships, will add 200 more scholarships for the new academic year. Ms Geraldine Tan, 19, welcomed the move by NUS and said it is important for young people to get into a field that excites them. She said: "I really want to study business and maybe go on an overseas college stint as I want to start a social enterprise. Business courses are hard to get into, so I am hoping the bonus points will help me get the edge." Hwa Chong Institution student Hannah Ganesh, 18, said increasing double degree options is good as students can diversify their learning and "challenge themselves".http://www.straitstimes.com/singapor...choice-courses NUS' new offerings BONUS POINTS FOR FIRST CHOICE Students applying to NUS will be given 1.25 bonus points for their first-choice course. This applies only to courses where entry is based purely on students' grades. MORE DOUBLE MAJORS NUS will be increasing the number of double majors to open up more career options for its graduates. It currently offers 94 double major and major-minor combinations and will add another 86 such programmes. NEW DEGREES A new concurrent degree combines NUS' Bachelor of Science and the Doctor of Veterinary Medicine offered by the University of Melbourne. Students can complete the programmes in 5-1/2 years. NUS is also offering a new joint degree in pharmaceutical science with the University of Dundee in Scotland. The programme is designed to provide students with knowledge and skills for careers in the pharmaceutical, biomedical and consumer healthcare sectors. NUS OVERSEAS COLLEGES The programme that sends students on internships to several entrepreneurial hubs in the world will be extended to Jakarta and Toronto. MORE BOND-FREE SCHOLARSHIPS NUS, which now offers 230 bond-free merit scholarships, will add another 200 scholarships in the new academic year. ",12.61357862747964

Totally agree with you that scholarship should not be awarded based on academic performance only, which I did mention in my earlier post. The primary objective of my earlier post aims to encourage individuals who are currently applying/appealing for admission and/or scholarship - through the sharing of my education journey and the challenges experienced as an individual with a disadvantaged background. Subsequently, the post also seeks to highlight the flaws in the basis of selection for the scholarship interview. Today, institutions are still using a uniform assessment method to evaluate people of diverse backgrounds. The assessment for academic potential is pretty straightforward - cGPA, awards, and other academic achievement obtained from other sources (e.g. competitions, courses, etc.). The tricky part lies in the assessment of non-academic components - institutions seek individuals with certain attributes, qualities, and skills (e.g. leadership, teamwork, entrepreneurship, integrity, sports achievement, etc.). And often, institutions only consider school-related activities and/or co-curricular activities as the samples for their assessment.  On a personal note, I believed that those attributes, qualities, and skillscould also beidentified and assessed through employment experience (e.g. customers' testimonials, appraisals by superiors, awards attained, etc.).  In general, institutions should also look beyond the school-related activities and co-curricular activities when assessing the non-academic components of individuals. Hence, granting more flexibility for underprivileged students whose non-academic profile were considered as "insubstantial" and thereby allowing  them to have the opportunity to share their stories. Ultimately, an interview is all we need.P.s. I'm glad that your hard work paid off, and congrats on securing that scholarship offered by a private company  (I missed the application deadline for private & government scholarship ) To be shortlisted for interview on the government scholarship with 3.5GPA, you must have some really outstanding non-academic achievements! Do you mind to share with us? And hello senior , assuming you are an SMU student (based on the GPA capped at 4.0). As an individual with similar experience, juggling between full-time work and study is really no joke, not to mention that you are doing it at the University-level and still managed to scored a decent grade. Mind to share what full-time job you work as? Do you study in the day, and work at night/after-school hours? Did you, perhaps, packed all modules into that few days so that you could work for the rest of the days in the week? Sincerely hope that you can share some tips with us/me Networking/cloud computing consultant.

Before your comments get lost in the sea of comments on this very active forum, let me reply to your rant/concerns. I just want to say that I get you. I totally do. Why? I was once in your position last year. Unknowingly fell into depression during the waiting period from April to May because I waited hopelessly for things that eventually (and obviously) did not come true... Exactly 1 year ago on this date (13 April 2017), I received a devastating offer from NTU — environmental engineering, and that was my last choice. It was supposed to be a celebration, that I received an offer, but it was the absolute last thing I wanted, since it wasn't my first choice, and something that I knew I couldn't accept doing (and was stupid enough to even place it in my choices, ah well).  Subsequently I got rejected by NUS and SMU, because I simply didn't make the cut... With a heavy heart I signed up (late) for private A levels, and as much as I hated the idea of having to retake, having to suffer... I had no choice. I really wanted to prove to myself that I CAN get into local uni. It didn't help when I'm from one of the top JCs, and my friends are moving on happily to overseas unis with unconditional offers, scholarships, or medicine, law, dentistry... you name it. I was utterly alone. And I felt like I was the only loser in my school (and also a disgrace to my school) who had to retake A levels, who couldn't really make the cut for local uni. In the end, ALL my appeals failed. What's new? Reality slapped me hard in the face, and it hurt like a bitch, of course. What could I do? I had to move on. I then spent some time correcting my mindset before I was actually more mentally stable for my exams. But I just have to tell you that you are really doing yourself a huge disfavour right now. Yes you are disappointed, you are not receiving news, everything seems oh so damn hopeless. But self pity will only kill you, as well as the people around you who love and care for you... do know that YOU are not the only one suffering, your family and friends are too! Everything seems bleak right now yes, but once you get that offer, everything will be merry and bright...  For me, I knew that I wanted to go to uni. I spent that one more year not just preparing for retake, but also redefining my goals and aspirations in my life. Also, building on my character. Depression no more! There were many sacrifices made, many times that I felt like hiding in a cave... but I overcame that and grew so much stronger. As long as you YEARN it, you will get it no matter what, because no one can stop you!! So don't even let the demons in your head stop you, please do not give in to depression. No one can help you except yourself. I suggest you try meditation and yoga, those things saved my ass (': And here I am back this year, legitly exactly one year later. I received my offer from NTU business...... It took one more year, but it was so worth it. Although my story might not be the most impressive one, but I've proved to everyone and most importantly myself that if I want something, I'm gonna make sure I get it, even if it means one year later. Because this is my future, and I am the captain of my ship of fate. I hope that you realise this too, be proud of who you are, of your battlescars, failures and experiences. All these will shape you into who you are — a better you. Chin up!! ",14.834825498793322

More internship and exchange opportunities than nus. 3. Many students take double majors and more % taking double degree. 4. More specialisation tracks. 5.

Lecture-tutorial style of learning, good for shy students who prefer mugging in a corner 2. Higher % of honours 3. Greater cohort size >> bell curve affects students less 3. You can take double majors too by DA or in the 2nd/3rd year 4. More campus life 5. Can stay in RC/hall etc. 6. For eg. econs is more academic and math inclined 7. World QS ranking The disadvantages of NUS: 1. Must find internships & exchange opportunities via the student (?) office. 2. Heavier and more modules esp for double major students (be prepared). I was offered double majors via DA, I counted 4 more modules for NUS than smu for the same double major combination. 3. More in depth and harder modules than smu (from my senior). 4. Hall/RC life may affect your academics. 5. Less specialisation tracks than smu.  Disclaimer ** What I think is subjective, I don’t mean to offend any NUS/SMU students reading this 😅 This is the summary of my ‘research’ haha xD. I am also deciding between nus and smu. Currently reading some year 1 stuff to see which one I like more I got SMU econs,  NUS FASS DMP and NBS offer tooWow your research is so detailed! Haha  Some things I would like to clarify for the benefit of everyone, which is based on my own knowledge and experience talking to friends across all 3 universities.  First and foremost, please take the employment surveys as a pinch of salt. Your salary won't be guaranteed to be higher just because you are enrolled in a particular university that is reported to have higher gross starting pay. Trust me,  when I was deciding on uni like you guys many years ago, I was affected by the graduate employment survey as well but then after years in uni and finally working,  I realised the survey might be misleading... Just so you know, most of these times when the graduates answer these surveys, the schools don't even check whether the pay you entered is true or not...How much you will get for your starting pay depends on your EXPERIENCE, your GRADES, your NEGOTIATION SKILLS, the ECONOMIC OUTLOOK at that POINT IN TIME,  the INDUSTRY and JOB SCOPE. Which uni honestly doesn't matter, cos all 3 local unis are considered on par to one another in the employers' eyes.  and it's just gross pay. There are other components in a salary package like bonuses and benefits which are not captured in the employment surveys. Some people may have a lower gross pay but may have higher bonuses and benefits (eg more days of leave) than someone with higher gross pay who may have less attractive bonuses and benefits. And many times, these surveys are not even representative of the whole student population as not all 100% of the graduating cohort would have completed the survey. Maybe it's just that small handful of students who did the survey and skewed the data?  regarding the point about students in nus being only able to source for internships from career office... That is not true at all. You can always self source (meaning you apply via websites like linkedin for eg by yourself) Oh and student exchange definitely must apply via student office regardless of whether is it nus ntu or smu... Cos all uni already have a list of overseas exchange partner universities that students can apply to then the student office will facilitate the process lor. The process is more or less the same across all 3 uni de.  And one more thing about nus I thought is worth mentioning, they have this NUS Overseas College (NOC) programme where you get to spend 1 year overseas studying and interning... You get to accumulate overseas work exp and clear modules like exchange as well. And the internships are paid. And there are many countries u can go to via this programme - Europe, Asia, USA. Do look it up. I kinda regretted not going 😭 cos it's such a valuable opportunity esp if u are passionate about entrepreneurship.Even if u are not its fine it's still great overseas exposure and it value adds to your resume! Oh and every school is competitive, not just SMU because regardless of which course or uni you go to, the bell curve is everywhere.  Choose your school based on the curriculum, the non academic opportunities available and the culture. Talk to seniors Or students who are studying in the universities and courses you have in mind to find out more. Talk to the recent students who have just graduated to find out more about the actual employment prospects and salary trends across the various unis and courses.  Hope this helps more people to come to a decision on which school to choose.",14.178989242136945

The professors themselves reiterate in the first lecture to tell us not to worry if you have no background because they will teach the basics to you. Agreed on the part for ICT1002 Programming Fundamental, Python is for beginners to learn as var in Python is loosely assign, don't have to care about memory allocation etc. Once student touch C will be another extreme. Memory allocation now is important, assigning var with wrong format and precision will cause C application to crash.

If you are unlucky that 2 of out of 4 teammates not contribute much, you will having the feeling of a sinking boat. Just a project in ICT1004 implement all this different language.  If you are totally new to programming, having ICT1001 supplement these knowledge such as SQL query statement. ICT1001 doesn't teach how to write stored procedure and other more advanced SQL statement such as left join, right join, union etc, while project if you know these trick, it can decrease the burden of writing inefficient codes. Also freeloader in ICT is another problem, playing taichi and act blur not contributing to project while others doing the project, they use the time to study for class test and exam.

Thanks whuttt wrote:  Good news for those borderline cases eyeing NUS " . . . . the plan to award up to 1.25 bonus points (equivalent of one H1 grade) to students applying for their first choice programme. The bonus points, applicable to programmes not requiring a pre-entry interview, will be added to the student’s University Admission Score. " http://news.nus.edu.sg/highlights/nu...on-initiatives NUS applicants to get bonus points for 1st-choice courses Passion for a field of study will count for admission to the National University of Singapore (NUS) from this year. Those applying for a place at NUS will be given 1.25 bonus points for their first choice - equivalent to going from C to B or B to A in an A-level H1 subject. This applies only to courses where entry is based purely on converting a student's grades into points, and not to courses such as medicine and law where students are assessed on their aptitude and interests through interviews. NUS senior deputy president and provost Ho Teck Hua, who announced the move at a press conference on Monday, said NUS analysis of admission data showed the bonus point can make a difference. "Let's say one student with 81 points applies for communications as his first choice, and another with 82 points applies to the same course as his second choice. With the 1.25 points, the student who lists the course as his first choice will get ahead of the person with 82 points," he said. On why NUS decided on the move, he said: "If you have done well and are passionate about a career in business or computing, for example, then we want to say to you that we support your passion." "We want to help you pursue your passion," he said, adding that students passionate about what they study tend to perform better. Professor Ho revealed that, currently, 65 per cent of students given a place in their first-choice course take up the offer, while only 45 per cent of those given their second-choice course do so. Noting NUS graduates' good job prospects, Prof Ho also announced that NUS will be increasing the number of double majors to increase career options for its graduates. "The nature of work is changing very rapidly, and we need to prepare students for a lifetime of diverse careers," he said. He said NUS, which currently offers 94 double major and major-minor combinations, will add another 86 such programmes. "Someone doing data science and entrepreneurship, for example, can go and work for a range of industries in data science, and also go and do a start-up." On top of the double majors, NUS also offers 71 double degrees, 33 joint degrees with partner universities and 24 concurrent degrees. Adding all this, currently 15 per cent of NUS students are trained in more than one discipline. Prof Ho said he hopes half of all NUS students will graduate with knowledge and skills in two different fields, so they will have more job offers to choose from. He also announced two new degree programmes for this year, one in pharmaceutical science and the other in veterinary science. Students taking up the 5 1/2-year concurrent veterinary degree programme will graduate with an NUS degree in life sciences and a Doctor of Veterinary Medicine from the University of Melbourne. NUS, which now offers 230 bond-free merit scholarships, will add 200 more scholarships for the new academic year. Ms Geraldine Tan, 19, welcomed the move by NUS and said it is important for young people to get into a field that excites them. She said: "I really want to study business and maybe go on an overseas college stint as I want to start a social enterprise. Business courses are hard to get into, so I am hoping the bonus points will help me get the edge." Hwa Chong Institution student Hannah Ganesh, 18, said increasing double degree options is good as students can diversify their learning and "challenge themselves".http://www.straitstimes.com/singapor...choice-courses NUS' new offerings BONUS POINTS FOR FIRST CHOICE Students applying to NUS will be given 1.25 bonus points for their first-choice course. This applies only to courses where entry is based purely on students' grades. MORE DOUBLE MAJORS NUS will be increasing the number of double majors to open up more career options for its graduates. It currently offers 94 double major and major-minor combinations and will add another 86 such programmes. NEW DEGREES A new concurrent degree combines NUS' Bachelor of Science and the Doctor of Veterinary Medicine offered by the University of Melbourne. Students can complete the programmes in 5-1/2 years. NUS is also offering a new joint degree in pharmaceutical science with the University of Dundee in Scotland. The programme is designed to provide students with knowledge and skills for careers in the pharmaceutical, biomedical and consumer healthcare sectors. NUS OVERSEAS COLLEGES The programme that sends students on internships to several entrepreneurial hubs in the world will be extended to Jakarta and Toronto.

Totally agree with you that scholarship should not be awarded based on academic performance only, which I did mention in my earlier post. The primary objective of my earlier post aims to encourage individuals who are currently applying/appealing for admission and/or scholarship - through the sharing of my education journey and the challenges experienced as an individual with a disadvantaged background. Subsequently, the post also seeks to highlight the flaws in the basis of selection for the scholarship interview. Today, institutions are still using a uniform assessment method to evaluate people of diverse backgrounds. The assessment for academic potential is pretty straightforward - cGPA, awards, and other academic achievement obtained from other sources (e.g. competitions, courses, etc.). The tricky part lies in the assessment of non-academic components - institutions seek individuals with certain attributes, qualities, and skills (e.g. leadership, teamwork, entrepreneurship, integrity, sports achievement, etc.). And often, institutions only consider school-related activities and/or co-curricular activities as the samples for their assessment.  On a personal note, I believed that those attributes, qualities, and skillscould also beidentified and assessed through employment experience (e.g. customers' testimonials, appraisals by superiors, awards attained, etc.).  In general, institutions should also look beyond the school-related activities and co-curricular activities when assessing the non-academic components of individuals. Hence, granting more flexibility for underprivileged students whose non-academic profile were considered as "insubstantial" and thereby allowing  them to have the opportunity to share their stories. Ultimately, an interview is all we need.P.s. I'm glad that your hard work paid off, and congrats on securing that scholarship offered by a private company  (I missed the application deadline for private & government scholarship ) To be shortlisted for interview on the government scholarship with 3.5GPA, you must have some really outstanding non-academic achievements! Do you mind to share with us? And hello senior , assuming you are an SMU student (based on the GPA capped at 4.0). As an individual with similar experience, juggling between full-time work and study is really no joke, not to mention that you are doing it at the University-level and still managed to scored a decent grade. Mind to share what full-time job you work as? Do you study in the day, and work at night/after-school hours? Did you, perhaps, packed all modules into that few days so that you could work for the rest of the days in the week? Sincerely hope that you can share some tips with us/me Networking/cloud computing consultant.

Subsequently I got rejected by NUS and SMU, because I simply didn't make the cut... With a heavy heart I signed up (late) for private A levels, and as much as I hated the idea of having to retake, having to suffer... I had no choice. I really wanted to prove to myself that I CAN get into local uni. It didn't help when I'm from one of the top JCs, and my friends are moving on happily to overseas unis with unconditional offers, scholarships, or medicine, law, dentistry... you name it. I was utterly alone. And I felt like I was the only loser in my school (and also a disgrace to my school) who had to retake A levels, who couldn't really make the cut for local uni. In the end, ALL my appeals failed. What's new? Reality slapped me hard in the face, and it hurt like a bitch, of course. What could I do? I had to move on. I then spent some time correcting my mindset before I was actually more mentally stable for my exams. But I just have to tell you that you are really doing yourself a huge disfavour right now. Yes you are disappointed, you are not receiving news, everything seems oh so damn hopeless. But self pity will only kill you, as well as the people around you who love and care for you... do know that YOU are not the only one suffering, your family and friends are too! Everything seems bleak right now yes, but once you get that offer, everything will be merry and bright...  For me, I knew that I wanted to go to uni. I spent that one more year not just preparing for retake, but also redefining my goals and aspirations in my life. Also, building on my character. Depression no more! There were many sacrifices made, many times that I felt like hiding in a cave... but I overcame that and grew so much stronger. As long as you YEARN it, you will get it no matter what, because no one can stop you!! So don't even let the demons in your head stop you, please do not give in to depression. No one can help you except yourself. I suggest you try meditation and yoga, those things saved my ass (': And here I am back this year, legitly exactly one year later. I received my offer from NTU business...... It took one more year, but it was so worth it. Although my story might not be the most impressive one, but I've proved to everyone and most importantly myself that if I want something, I'm gonna make sure I get it, even if it means one year later. Because this is my future, and I am the captain of my ship of fate. I hope that you realise this too, be proud of who you are, of your battlescars, failures and experiences. All these will shape you into who you are — a better you. Chin up!! ",14.834825498793322

I heard from a senior in fass that 1 module in fass is about 1 lecture & 1 tutorial per week btw. The benefits of smu: 1. You get to interact and actively engage yourself during lessons. 2. More internship and exchange opportunities than nus. 3. Many students take double majors and more % taking double degree. 4. More specialisation tracks. 5. Higher employment and salary on average according to the employment survey. The downsides of smu: 1. Competition in smu is fierce. 2. Less campus life (in terms of hall etc) 3. The % of honours students there is lower than fass as it is harder to achieve honours in smu. 4. Less opportunities to make friends (Depends on your personality) The advantages of fass: 1. Lecture-tutorial style of learning, good for shy students who prefer mugging in a corner 2. Higher % of honours 3. Greater cohort size >> bell curve affects students less 3. You can take double majors too by DA or in the 2nd/3rd year 4. More campus life 5. Can stay in RC/hall etc. 6. For eg. econs is more academic and math inclined 7. World QS ranking The disadvantages of NUS: 1. Must find internships & exchange opportunities via the student (?) office. 2. Heavier and more modules esp for double major students (be prepared). I was offered double majors via DA, I counted 4 more modules for NUS than smu for the same double major combination. 3. More in depth and harder modules than smu (from my senior). 4. Hall/RC life may affect your academics. 5. Less specialisation tracks than smu.  Disclaimer ** What I think is subjective, I don’t mean to offend any NUS/SMU students reading this 😅 This is the summary of my ‘research’ haha xD. I am also deciding between nus and smu. Currently reading some year 1 stuff to see which one I like more I got SMU econs,  NUS FASS DMP and NBS offer tooWow your research is so detailed! Haha  Some things I would like to clarify for the benefit of everyone, which is based on my own knowledge and experience talking to friends across all 3 universities.  First and foremost, please take the employment surveys as a pinch of salt. Your salary won't be guaranteed to be higher just because you are enrolled in a particular university that is reported to have higher gross starting pay. Trust me,  when I was deciding on uni like you guys many years ago, I was affected by the graduate employment survey as well but then after years in uni and finally working,  I realised the survey might be misleading... Just so you know, most of these times when the graduates answer these surveys, the schools don't even check whether the pay you entered is true or not...How much you will get for your starting pay depends on your EXPERIENCE, your GRADES, your NEGOTIATION SKILLS, the ECONOMIC OUTLOOK at that POINT IN TIME,  the INDUSTRY and JOB SCOPE. Which uni honestly doesn't matter, cos all 3 local unis are considered on par to one another in the employers' eyes.  and it's just gross pay. There are other components in a salary package like bonuses and benefits which are not captured in the employment surveys. Some people may have a lower gross pay but may have higher bonuses and benefits (eg more days of leave) than someone with higher gross pay who may have less attractive bonuses and benefits. And many times, these surveys are not even representative of the whole student population as not all 100% of the graduating cohort would have completed the survey. Maybe it's just that small handful of students who did the survey and skewed the data?  regarding the point about students in nus being only able to source for internships from career office... That is not true at all. You can always self source (meaning you apply via websites like linkedin for eg by yourself) Oh and student exchange definitely must apply via student office regardless of whether is it nus ntu or smu... Cos all uni already have a list of overseas exchange partner universities that students can apply to then the student office will facilitate the process lor. The process is more or less the same across all 3 uni de.  And one more thing about nus I thought is worth mentioning, they have this NUS Overseas College (NOC) programme where you get to spend 1 year overseas studying and interning... You get to accumulate overseas work exp and clear modules like exchange as well. And the internships are paid. And there are many countries u can go to via this programme - Europe, Asia, USA. Do look it up. I kinda regretted not going 😭 cos it's such a valuable opportunity esp if u are passionate about entrepreneurship.Even if u are not its fine it's still great overseas exposure and it value adds to your resume! Oh and every school is competitive, not just SMU because regardless of which course or uni you go to, the bell curve is everywhere.  Choose your school based on the curriculum, the non academic opportunities available and the culture. Talk to seniors Or students who are studying in the universities and courses you have in mind to find out more. Talk to the recent students who have just graduated to find out more about the actual employment prospects and salary trends across the various unis and courses.  Hope this helps more people to come to a decision on which school to choose.",14.178989242136945

I challenge anyone who has seen that to tell me that its not meant for someone with 0 background in coding. The professors themselves reiterate in the first lecture to tell us not to worry if you have no background because they will teach the basics to you. Agreed on the part for ICT1002 Programming Fundamental, Python is for beginners to learn as var in Python is loosely assign, don't have to care about memory allocation etc. Once student touch C will be another extreme. Memory allocation now is important, assigning var with wrong format and precision will cause C application to crash.

If you are unlucky that 2 of out of 4 teammates not contribute much, you will having the feeling of a sinking boat. Just a project in ICT1004 implement all this different language.  If you are totally new to programming, having ICT1001 supplement these knowledge such as SQL query statement. ICT1001 doesn't teach how to write stored procedure and other more advanced SQL statement such as left join, right join, union etc, while project if you know these trick, it can decrease the burden of writing inefficient codes. Also freeloader in ICT is another problem, playing taichi and act blur not contributing to project while others doing the project, they use the time to study for class test and exam. Also known as "being carried". During exam for the first trimester, some wrote C code in PHP question, PHP code in Python question, Python code in JavaScript.

Thanks whuttt wrote:  Good news for those borderline cases eyeing NUS " . . . . the plan to award up to 1.25 bonus points (equivalent of one H1 grade) to students applying for their first choice programme. The bonus points, applicable to programmes not requiring a pre-entry interview, will be added to the student’s University Admission Score. " http://news.nus.edu.sg/highlights/nu...on-initiatives NUS applicants to get bonus points for 1st-choice courses Passion for a field of study will count for admission to the National University of Singapore (NUS) from this year. Those applying for a place at NUS will be given 1.25 bonus points for their first choice - equivalent to going from C to B or B to A in an A-level H1 subject. This applies only to courses where entry is based purely on converting a student's grades into points, and not to courses such as medicine and law where students are assessed on their aptitude and interests through interviews. NUS senior deputy president and provost Ho Teck Hua, who announced the move at a press conference on Monday, said NUS analysis of admission data showed the bonus point can make a difference. "Let's say one student with 81 points applies for communications as his first choice, and another with 82 points applies to the same course as his second choice. With the 1.25 points, the student who lists the course as his first choice will get ahead of the person with 82 points," he said. On why NUS decided on the move, he said: "If you have done well and are passionate about a career in business or computing, for example, then we want to say to you that we support your passion." "We want to help you pursue your passion," he said, adding that students passionate about what they study tend to perform better. Professor Ho revealed that, currently, 65 per cent of students given a place in their first-choice course take up the offer, while only 45 per cent of those given their second-choice course do so. Noting NUS graduates' good job prospects, Prof Ho also announced that NUS will be increasing the number of double majors to increase career options for its graduates. "The nature of work is changing very rapidly, and we need to prepare students for a lifetime of diverse careers," he said. He said NUS, which currently offers 94 double major and major-minor combinations, will add another 86 such programmes. "Someone doing data science and entrepreneurship, for example, can go and work for a range of industries in data science, and also go and do a start-up." On top of the double majors, NUS also offers 71 double degrees, 33 joint degrees with partner universities and 24 concurrent degrees. Adding all this, currently 15 per cent of NUS students are trained in more than one discipline. Prof Ho said he hopes half of all NUS students will graduate with knowledge and skills in two different fields, so they will have more job offers to choose from. He also announced two new degree programmes for this year, one in pharmaceutical science and the other in veterinary science. Students taking up the 5 1/2-year concurrent veterinary degree programme will graduate with an NUS degree in life sciences and a Doctor of Veterinary Medicine from the University of Melbourne. NUS, which now offers 230 bond-free merit scholarships, will add 200 more scholarships for the new academic year. Ms Geraldine Tan, 19, welcomed the move by NUS and said it is important for young people to get into a field that excites them. She said: "I really want to study business and maybe go on an overseas college stint as I want to start a social enterprise. Business courses are hard to get into, so I am hoping the bonus points will help me get the edge." Hwa Chong Institution student Hannah Ganesh, 18, said increasing double degree options is good as students can diversify their learning and "challenge themselves".http://www.straitstimes.com/singapor...choice-courses NUS' new offerings BONUS POINTS FOR FIRST CHOICE Students applying to NUS will be given 1.25 bonus points for their first-choice course. This applies only to courses where entry is based purely on students' grades. MORE DOUBLE MAJORS NUS will be increasing the number of double majors to open up more career options for its graduates. It currently offers 94 double major and major-minor combinations and will add another 86 such programmes. NEW DEGREES A new concurrent degree combines NUS' Bachelor of Science and the Doctor of Veterinary Medicine offered by the University of Melbourne. Students can complete the programmes in 5-1/2 years. NUS is also offering a new joint degree in pharmaceutical science with the University of Dundee in Scotland. The programme is designed to provide students with knowledge and skills for careers in the pharmaceutical, biomedical and consumer healthcare sectors. NUS OVERSEAS COLLEGES The programme that sends students on internships to several entrepreneurial hubs in the world will be extended to Jakarta and Toronto.

Totally agree with you that scholarship should not be awarded based on academic performance only, which I did mention in my earlier post. The primary objective of my earlier post aims to encourage individuals who are currently applying/appealing for admission and/or scholarship - through the sharing of my education journey and the challenges experienced as an individual with a disadvantaged background. Subsequently, the post also seeks to highlight the flaws in the basis of selection for the scholarship interview. Today, institutions are still using a uniform assessment method to evaluate people of diverse backgrounds. The assessment for academic potential is pretty straightforward - cGPA, awards, and other academic achievement obtained from other sources (e.g. competitions, courses, etc.). The tricky part lies in the assessment of non-academic components - institutions seek individuals with certain attributes, qualities, and skills (e.g. leadership, teamwork, entrepreneurship, integrity, sports achievement, etc.). And often, institutions only consider school-related activities and/or co-curricular activities as the samples for their assessment.  On a personal note, I believed that those attributes, qualities, and skillscould also beidentified and assessed through employment experience (e.g. customers' testimonials, appraisals by superiors, awards attained, etc.).  In general, institutions should also look beyond the school-related activities and co-curricular activities when assessing the non-academic components of individuals. Hence, granting more flexibility for underprivileged students whose non-academic profile were considered as "insubstantial" and thereby allowing  them to have the opportunity to share their stories. Ultimately, an interview is all we need.P.s. I'm glad that your hard work paid off, and congrats on securing that scholarship offered by a private company  (I missed the application deadline for private & government scholarship ) To be shortlisted for interview on the government scholarship with 3.5GPA, you must have some really outstanding non-academic achievements! Do you mind to share with us? And hello senior , assuming you are an SMU student (based on the GPA capped at 4.0). As an individual with similar experience, juggling between full-time work and study is really no joke, not to mention that you are doing it at the University-level and still managed to scored a decent grade. Mind to share what full-time job you work as? Do you study in the day, and work at night/after-school hours? Did you, perhaps, packed all modules into that few days so that you could work for the rest of the days in the week?

(I don't get why the email even said smart casual, but I just followed the email...) NTU and NUS completely ignoring me forever. I've gotten so depressed I'm no longer depressed. Perhaps this is one way of curing yourself of depression: where everything becomes a delusion and nothing in life matters anymore. It sucks that everything to form a judgment on someone can just be based on a single event on a single day and nothing else, but well, that's life. You can say there's still time but I just can't take waiting up to 3 agonizing more months later. If anything, the only realistic thing in life that will ever happen is me writing that appeal letter. Before your comments get lost in the sea of comments on this very active forum, let me reply to your rant/concerns. I just want to say that I get you. I totally do. Why? I was once in your position last year. Unknowingly fell into depression during the waiting period from April to May because I waited hopelessly for things that eventually (and obviously) did not come true... Exactly 1 year ago on this date (13 April 2017), I received a devastating offer from NTU — environmental engineering, and that was my last choice. It was supposed to be a celebration, that I received an offer, but it was the absolute last thing I wanted, since it wasn't my first choice, and something that I knew I couldn't accept doing (and was stupid enough to even place it in my choices, ah well).  Subsequently I got rejected by NUS and SMU, because I simply didn't make the cut... With a heavy heart I signed up (late) for private A levels, and as much as I hated the idea of having to retake, having to suffer... I had no choice. I really wanted to prove to myself that I CAN get into local uni. It didn't help when I'm from one of the top JCs, and my friends are moving on happily to overseas unis with unconditional offers, scholarships, or medicine, law, dentistry... you name it. I was utterly alone. And I felt like I was the only loser in my school (and also a disgrace to my school) who had to retake A levels, who couldn't really make the cut for local uni. In the end, ALL my appeals failed. What's new? Reality slapped me hard in the face, and it hurt like a bitch, of course. What could I do? I had to move on. I then spent some time correcting my mindset before I was actually more mentally stable for my exams. But I just have to tell you that you are really doing yourself a huge disfavour right now. Yes you are disappointed, you are not receiving news, everything seems oh so damn hopeless. But self pity will only kill you, as well as the people around you who love and care for you... do know that YOU are not the only one suffering, your family and friends are too! Everything seems bleak right now yes, but once you get that offer, everything will be merry and bright...  For me, I knew that I wanted to go to uni. I spent that one more year not just preparing for retake, but also redefining my goals and aspirations in my life. Also, building on my character. Depression no more! There were many sacrifices made, many times that I felt like hiding in a cave... but I overcame that and grew so much stronger. As long as you YEARN it, you will get it no matter what, because no one can stop you!! So don't even let the demons in your head stop you, please do not give in to depression. No one can help you except yourself. I suggest you try meditation and yoga, those things saved my ass (': And here I am back this year, legitly exactly one year later. I received my offer from NTU business...... It took one more year, but it was so worth it. Although my story might not be the most impressive one, but I've proved to everyone and most importantly myself that if I want something, I'm gonna make sure I get it, even if it means one year later. Because this is my future, and I am the captain of my ship of fate. I hope that you realise this too, be proud of who you are, of your battlescars, failures and experiences. All these will shape you into who you are — a better you. Chin up!! ",14.834825498793322

I heard from a senior in fass that 1 module in fass is about 1 lecture & 1 tutorial per week btw. The benefits of smu: 1. You get to interact and actively engage yourself during lessons. 2. More internship and exchange opportunities than nus. 3. Many students take double majors and more % taking double degree. 4. More specialisation tracks. 5. Higher employment and salary on average according to the employment survey. The downsides of smu: 1. Competition in smu is fierce. 2. Less campus life (in terms of hall etc) 3. The % of honours students there is lower than fass as it is harder to achieve honours in smu. 4. Less opportunities to make friends (Depends on your personality) The advantages of fass: 1. Lecture-tutorial style of learning, good for shy students who prefer mugging in a corner 2. Higher % of honours 3. Greater cohort size >> bell curve affects students less 3. You can take double majors too by DA or in the 2nd/3rd year 4. More campus life 5. Can stay in RC/hall etc. 6. For eg. econs is more academic and math inclined 7. World QS ranking The disadvantages of NUS: 1. Must find internships & exchange opportunities via the student (?) office. 2. Heavier and more modules esp for double major students (be prepared). I was offered double majors via DA, I counted 4 more modules for NUS than smu for the same double major combination. 3. More in depth and harder modules than smu (from my senior). 4. Hall/RC life may affect your academics. 5. Less specialisation tracks than smu.  Disclaimer ** What I think is subjective, I don’t mean to offend any NUS/SMU students reading this 😅 This is the summary of my ‘research’ haha xD. I am also deciding between nus and smu. Currently reading some year 1 stuff to see which one I like more I got SMU econs,  NUS FASS DMP and NBS offer tooWow your research is so detailed! Haha  Some things I would like to clarify for the benefit of everyone, which is based on my own knowledge and experience talking to friends across all 3 universities.  First and foremost, please take the employment surveys as a pinch of salt. Your salary won't be guaranteed to be higher just because you are enrolled in a particular university that is reported to have higher gross starting pay. Trust me,  when I was deciding on uni like you guys many years ago, I was affected by the graduate employment survey as well but then after years in uni and finally working,  I realised the survey might be misleading... Just so you know, most of these times when the graduates answer these surveys, the schools don't even check whether the pay you entered is true or not...How much you will get for your starting pay depends on your EXPERIENCE, your GRADES, your NEGOTIATION SKILLS, the ECONOMIC OUTLOOK at that POINT IN TIME,  the INDUSTRY and JOB SCOPE. Which uni honestly doesn't matter, cos all 3 local unis are considered on par to one another in the employers' eyes.  and it's just gross pay. There are other components in a salary package like bonuses and benefits which are not captured in the employment surveys. Some people may have a lower gross pay but may have higher bonuses and benefits (eg more days of leave) than someone with higher gross pay who may have less attractive bonuses and benefits. And many times, these surveys are not even representative of the whole student population as not all 100% of the graduating cohort would have completed the survey. Maybe it's just that small handful of students who did the survey and skewed the data?  regarding the point about students in nus being only able to source for internships from career office... That is not true at all. You can always self source (meaning you apply via websites like linkedin for eg by yourself) Oh and student exchange definitely must apply via student office regardless of whether is it nus ntu or smu... Cos all uni already have a list of overseas exchange partner universities that students can apply to then the student office will facilitate the process lor. The process is more or less the same across all 3 uni de.  And one more thing about nus I thought is worth mentioning, they have this NUS Overseas College (NOC) programme where you get to spend 1 year overseas studying and interning... You get to accumulate overseas work exp and clear modules like exchange as well. And the internships are paid. And there are many countries u can go to via this programme - Europe, Asia, USA. Do look it up. I kinda regretted not going 😭 cos it's such a valuable opportunity esp if u are passionate about entrepreneurship.Even if u are not its fine it's still great overseas exposure and it value adds to your resume! Oh and every school is competitive, not just SMU because regardless of which course or uni you go to, the bell curve is everywhere.  Choose your school based on the curriculum, the non academic opportunities available and the culture. Talk to seniors Or students who are studying in the universities and courses you have in mind to find out more. Talk to the recent students who have just graduated to find out more about the actual employment prospects and salary trends across the various unis and courses.  Hope this helps more people to come to a decision on which school to choose.",14.178989242136945

The professors themselves reiterate in the first lecture to tell us not to worry if you have no background because they will teach the basics to you. Agreed on the part for ICT1002 Programming Fundamental, Python is for beginners to learn as var in Python is loosely assign, don't have to care about memory allocation etc. Once student touch C will be another extreme. Memory allocation now is important, assigning var with wrong format and precision will cause C application to crash.

If you are unlucky that 2 of out of 4 teammates not contribute much, you will having the feeling of a sinking boat. Just a project in ICT1004 implement all this different language.  If you are totally new to programming, having ICT1001 supplement these knowledge such as SQL query statement. ICT1001 doesn't teach how to write stored procedure and other more advanced SQL statement such as left join, right join, union etc, while project if you know these trick, it can decrease the burden of writing inefficient codes. Also freeloader in ICT is another problem, playing taichi and act blur not contributing to project while others doing the project, they use the time to study for class test and exam. Also known as "being carried". During exam for the first trimester, some wrote C code in PHP question, PHP code in Python question, Python code in JavaScript.

Thanks whuttt wrote:  Good news for those borderline cases eyeing NUS " . . . . the plan to award up to 1.25 bonus points (equivalent of one H1 grade) to students applying for their first choice programme. The bonus points, applicable to programmes not requiring a pre-entry interview, will be added to the student’s University Admission Score. " http://news.nus.edu.sg/highlights/nu...on-initiatives NUS applicants to get bonus points for 1st-choice courses Passion for a field of study will count for admission to the National University of Singapore (NUS) from this year. Those applying for a place at NUS will be given 1.25 bonus points for their first choice - equivalent to going from C to B or B to A in an A-level H1 subject. This applies only to courses where entry is based purely on converting a student's grades into points, and not to courses such as medicine and law where students are assessed on their aptitude and interests through interviews. NUS senior deputy president and provost Ho Teck Hua, who announced the move at a press conference on Monday, said NUS analysis of admission data showed the bonus point can make a difference. "Let's say one student with 81 points applies for communications as his first choice, and another with 82 points applies to the same course as his second choice. With the 1.25 points, the student who lists the course as his first choice will get ahead of the person with 82 points," he said. On why NUS decided on the move, he said: "If you have done well and are passionate about a career in business or computing, for example, then we want to say to you that we support your passion." "We want to help you pursue your passion," he said, adding that students passionate about what they study tend to perform better. Professor Ho revealed that, currently, 65 per cent of students given a place in their first-choice course take up the offer, while only 45 per cent of those given their second-choice course do so. Noting NUS graduates' good job prospects, Prof Ho also announced that NUS will be increasing the number of double majors to increase career options for its graduates. "The nature of work is changing very rapidly, and we need to prepare students for a lifetime of diverse careers," he said. He said NUS, which currently offers 94 double major and major-minor combinations, will add another 86 such programmes. "Someone doing data science and entrepreneurship, for example, can go and work for a range of industries in data science, and also go and do a start-up." On top of the double majors, NUS also offers 71 double degrees, 33 joint degrees with partner universities and 24 concurrent degrees. Adding all this, currently 15 per cent of NUS students are trained in more than one discipline. Prof Ho said he hopes half of all NUS students will graduate with knowledge and skills in two different fields, so they will have more job offers to choose from. He also announced two new degree programmes for this year, one in pharmaceutical science and the other in veterinary science. Students taking up the 5 1/2-year concurrent veterinary degree programme will graduate with an NUS degree in life sciences and a Doctor of Veterinary Medicine from the University of Melbourne. NUS, which now offers 230 bond-free merit scholarships, will add 200 more scholarships for the new academic year. Ms Geraldine Tan, 19, welcomed the move by NUS and said it is important for young people to get into a field that excites them. She said: "I really want to study business and maybe go on an overseas college stint as I want to start a social enterprise. Business courses are hard to get into, so I am hoping the bonus points will help me get the edge." Hwa Chong Institution student Hannah Ganesh, 18, said increasing double degree options is good as students can diversify their learning and "challenge themselves".http://www.straitstimes.com/singapor...choice-courses NUS' new offerings BONUS POINTS FOR FIRST CHOICE Students applying to NUS will be given 1.25 bonus points for their first-choice course. This applies only to courses where entry is based purely on students' grades. MORE DOUBLE MAJORS NUS will be increasing the number of double majors to open up more career options for its graduates. It currently offers 94 double major and major-minor combinations and will add another 86 such programmes. NEW DEGREES A new concurrent degree combines NUS' Bachelor of Science and the Doctor of Veterinary Medicine offered by the University of Melbourne. Students can complete the programmes in 5-1/2 years. NUS is also offering a new joint degree in pharmaceutical science with the University of Dundee in Scotland. The programme is designed to provide students with knowledge and skills for careers in the pharmaceutical, biomedical and consumer healthcare sectors. NUS OVERSEAS COLLEGES The programme that sends students on internships to several entrepreneurial hubs in the world will be extended to Jakarta and Toronto.

Totally agree with you that scholarship should not be awarded based on academic performance only, which I did mention in my earlier post. The primary objective of my earlier post aims to encourage individuals who are currently applying/appealing for admission and/or scholarship - through the sharing of my education journey and the challenges experienced as an individual with a disadvantaged background. Subsequently, the post also seeks to highlight the flaws in the basis of selection for the scholarship interview. Today, institutions are still using a uniform assessment method to evaluate people of diverse backgrounds. The assessment for academic potential is pretty straightforward - cGPA, awards, and other academic achievement obtained from other sources (e.g. competitions, courses, etc.). The tricky part lies in the assessment of non-academic components - institutions seek individuals with certain attributes, qualities, and skills (e.g. leadership, teamwork, entrepreneurship, integrity, sports achievement, etc.). And often, institutions only consider school-related activities and/or co-curricular activities as the samples for their assessment.  On a personal note, I believed that those attributes, qualities, and skillscould also beidentified and assessed through employment experience (e.g. customers' testimonials, appraisals by superiors, awards attained, etc.).  In general, institutions should also look beyond the school-related activities and co-curricular activities when assessing the non-academic components of individuals. Hence, granting more flexibility for underprivileged students whose non-academic profile were considered as "insubstantial" and thereby allowing  them to have the opportunity to share their stories. Ultimately, an interview is all we need.P.s. I'm glad that your hard work paid off, and congrats on securing that scholarship offered by a private company  (I missed the application deadline for private & government scholarship ) To be shortlisted for interview on the government scholarship with 3.5GPA, you must have some really outstanding non-academic achievements! Do you mind to share with us? And hello senior , assuming you are an SMU student (based on the GPA capped at 4.0). As an individual with similar experience, juggling between full-time work and study is really no joke, not to mention that you are doing it at the University-level and still managed to scored a decent grade. Mind to share what full-time job you work as? Do you study in the day, and work at night/after-school hours? Did you, perhaps, packed all modules into that few days so that you could work for the rest of the days in the week? Sincerely hope that you can share some tips with us/me Networking/cloud computing consultant. And if you can get some really well-known individual in the industry to write recommendation letter would really be helpful.

Coming from a disadvantaged background, I spent most of my time working to facilitate personal living expenses as well as to contribute to the family's finances. And with most of the time spent on work (e.g. after-school hours, weekends, and vacation periods), my investment in non-academic activities (e.g. CCA, competitions, etc.) was limited to 8 hours per week and would often have to give up on activities such as YEP and OIP due to the cost and time involved. Therefore, my non-academic profile was considered to be "insubstantial" in comparison with other individuals who had the resources to be a full-time student. Whilst there is nothing wrong with awarding scholarships primarily on academic achievement, the current selection criteria and system may be further skewed against lower-income households, as their children may have less in the areas of co-curricular activities, leadership track record, etc, because of their limited financial resources. This may further stack the odds against the lower-income, who have fewer resources to access tuition, enrichment programmes, learning aids, etc. The irony of how institutions used a uniform assessment method to evaluate people of diverse backgrounds - the subtle ways colleges discriminate against poor students  Ultimately, life is fair because the world is unfair to everyone  Heng (lucky) still can apply for financial aid  Woah!

If business is your end goal, start thinking of alternatives; for example maybe taking economica or an arts course but majoring in business and then perhaps appealing for transfer etc, or writing that appeal letter. You can make life alot harder for yourself by focusing on the negative stuff, or to make an excuse for why things didnt go your way. Learn from them, its a choice, YOUR choice. Dont victimize yourself, learn from them and be the best version of yourself. Wisdom is knowing what you CAN control and what you CANT control",11.887772861124832

Coming from a disadvantaged background, I spent most of my time working to facilitate personal living expenses as well as to contribute to the family's finances. And with most of the time spent on work (e.g. after-school hours, weekends, and vacation periods), my investment in non-academic activities (e.g. CCA, competitions, etc.) was limited to 8 hours per week and would often have to give up on activities such as YEP and OIP due to the cost and time involved. Therefore, my non-academic profile was considered to be "insubstantial" in comparison with other individuals who had the resources to be a full-time student. Whilst there is nothing wrong with awarding scholarships primarily on academic achievement, the current selection criteria and system may be further skewed against lower-income households, as their children may have less in the areas of co-curricular activities, leadership track record, etc, because of their limited financial resources. This may further stack the odds against the lower-income, who have fewer resources to access tuition, enrichment programmes, learning aids, etc. The irony of how institutions used a uniform assessment method to evaluate people of diverse backgrounds - the subtle ways colleges discriminate against poor students  Ultimately, life is fair because the world is unfair to everyone  Heng (lucky) still can apply for financial aid Little Angry Potato wrote:  3.97.

SMU rejected me or on waiting list now. Prepared so much in the topic but apparently not on the dress code or speaking enough like an ang moh. I was the only one that came in jeans and sneakers while everyone else were wearing formal. Is that overdress or what's to be expected? (I don't get why the email even said smart casual, but I just followed the email...) NTU and NUS completely ignoring me forever. I've gotten so depressed I'm no longer depressed. Perhaps this is one way of curing yourself of depression: where everything becomes a delusion and nothing in life matters anymore. It sucks that everything to form a judgment on someone can just be based on a single event on a single day and nothing else, but well, that's life. You can say there's still time but I just can't take waiting up to 3 agonizing more months later. If anything, the only realistic thing in life that will ever happen is me writing that appeal letter. Before your comments get lost in the sea of comments on this very active forum, let me reply to your rant/concerns. I just want to say that I get you. I totally do. Why? I was once in your position last year. Unknowingly fell into depression during the waiting period from April to May because I waited hopelessly for things that eventually (and obviously) did not come true... Exactly 1 year ago on this date (13 April 2017), I received a devastating offer from NTU — environmental engineering, and that was my last choice. It was supposed to be a celebration, that I received an offer, but it was the absolute last thing I wanted, since it wasn't my first choice, and something that I knew I couldn't accept doing (and was stupid enough to even place it in my choices, ah well).  Subsequently I got rejected by NUS and SMU, because I simply didn't make the cut... With a heavy heart I signed up (late) for private A levels, and as much as I hated the idea of having to retake, having to suffer... I had no choice. I really wanted to prove to myself that I CAN get into local uni. It didn't help when I'm from one of the top JCs, and my friends are moving on happily to overseas unis with unconditional offers, scholarships, or medicine, law, dentistry... you name it. I was utterly alone. And I felt like I was the only loser in my school (and also a disgrace to my school) who had to retake A levels, who couldn't really make the cut for local uni. In the end, ALL my appeals failed. What's new? Reality slapped me hard in the face, and it hurt like a bitch, of course. What could I do? I had to move on. I then spent some time correcting my mindset before I was actually more mentally stable for my exams. But I just have to tell you that you are really doing yourself a huge disfavour right now. Yes you are disappointed, you are not receiving news, everything seems oh so damn hopeless. But self pity will only kill you, as well as the people around you who love and care for you... do know that YOU are not the only one suffering, your family and friends are too! Everything seems bleak right now yes, but once you get that offer, everything will be merry and bright...  For me, I knew that I wanted to go to uni. I spent that one more year not just preparing for retake, but also redefining my goals and aspirations in my life. Also, building on my character. Depression no more! There were many sacrifices made, many times that I felt like hiding in a cave... but I overcame that and grew so much stronger. As long as you YEARN it, you will get it no matter what, because no one can stop you!! So don't even let the demons in your head stop you, please do not give in to depression. No one can help you except yourself. I suggest you try meditation and yoga, those things saved my ass (': And here I am back this year, legitly exactly one year later. I received my offer from NTU business...... It took one more year, but it was so worth it. Although my story might not be the most impressive one, but I've proved to everyone and most importantly myself that if I want something, I'm gonna make sure I get it, even if it means one year later. Because this is my future, and I am the captain of my ship of fate. I hope that you realise this too, be proud of who you are, of your battlescars, failures and experiences. All these will shape you into who you are — a better you. Chin up!! ",14.834825498793322

I heard from a senior in fass that 1 module in fass is about 1 lecture & 1 tutorial per week btw. The benefits of smu: 1. You get to interact and actively engage yourself during lessons. 2. More internship and exchange opportunities than nus. 3. Many students take double majors and more % taking double degree. 4. More specialisation tracks. 5. Higher employment and salary on average according to the employment survey. The downsides of smu: 1. Competition in smu is fierce. 2. Less campus life (in terms of hall etc) 3. The % of honours students there is lower than fass as it is harder to achieve honours in smu. 4. Less opportunities to make friends (Depends on your personality) The advantages of fass: 1. Lecture-tutorial style of learning, good for shy students who prefer mugging in a corner 2. Higher % of honours 3. Greater cohort size >> bell curve affects students less 3. You can take double majors too by DA or in the 2nd/3rd year 4. More campus life 5. Can stay in RC/hall etc. 6. For eg. econs is more academic and math inclined 7. World QS ranking The disadvantages of NUS: 1. Must find internships & exchange opportunities via the student (?) office. 2. Heavier and more modules esp for double major students (be prepared). I was offered double majors via DA, I counted 4 more modules for NUS than smu for the same double major combination. 3. More in depth and harder modules than smu (from my senior). 4. Hall/RC life may affect your academics. 5. Less specialisation tracks than smu.  Disclaimer ** What I think is subjective, I don’t mean to offend any NUS/SMU students reading this 😅 This is the summary of my ‘research’ haha xD. I am also deciding between nus and smu. Currently reading some year 1 stuff to see which one I like more I got SMU econs,  NUS FASS DMP and NBS offer tooWow your research is so detailed! Haha  Some things I would like to clarify for the benefit of everyone, which is based on my own knowledge and experience talking to friends across all 3 universities.  First and foremost, please take the employment surveys as a pinch of salt. Your salary won't be guaranteed to be higher just because you are enrolled in a particular university that is reported to have higher gross starting pay. Trust me,  when I was deciding on uni like you guys many years ago, I was affected by the graduate employment survey as well but then after years in uni and finally working,  I realised the survey might be misleading... Just so you know, most of these times when the graduates answer these surveys, the schools don't even check whether the pay you entered is true or not...How much you will get for your starting pay depends on your EXPERIENCE, your GRADES, your NEGOTIATION SKILLS, the ECONOMIC OUTLOOK at that POINT IN TIME,  the INDUSTRY and JOB SCOPE. Which uni honestly doesn't matter, cos all 3 local unis are considered on par to one another in the employers' eyes.  and it's just gross pay. There are other components in a salary package like bonuses and benefits which are not captured in the employment surveys. Some people may have a lower gross pay but may have higher bonuses and benefits (eg more days of leave) than someone with higher gross pay who may have less attractive bonuses and benefits. And many times, these surveys are not even representative of the whole student population as not all 100% of the graduating cohort would have completed the survey. Maybe it's just that small handful of students who did the survey and skewed the data?  regarding the point about students in nus being only able to source for internships from career office... That is not true at all. You can always self source (meaning you apply via websites like linkedin for eg by yourself) Oh and student exchange definitely must apply via student office regardless of whether is it nus ntu or smu... Cos all uni already have a list of overseas exchange partner universities that students can apply to then the student office will facilitate the process lor. The process is more or less the same across all 3 uni de.  And one more thing about nus I thought is worth mentioning, they have this NUS Overseas College (NOC) programme where you get to spend 1 year overseas studying and interning... You get to accumulate overseas work exp and clear modules like exchange as well. And the internships are paid. And there are many countries u can go to via this programme - Europe, Asia, USA. Do look it up. I kinda regretted not going 😭 cos it's such a valuable opportunity esp if u are passionate about entrepreneurship.Even if u are not its fine it's still great overseas exposure and it value adds to your resume! Oh and every school is competitive, not just SMU because regardless of which course or uni you go to, the bell curve is everywhere.  Choose your school based on the curriculum, the non academic opportunities available and the culture. Talk to seniors Or students who are studying in the universities and courses you have in mind to find out more. Talk to the recent students who have just graduated to find out more about the actual employment prospects and salary trends across the various unis and courses.  Hope this helps more people to come to a decision on which school to choose.",14.178989242136945

Agreed on the part for ICT1002 Programming Fundamental, Python is for beginners to learn as var in Python is loosely assign, don't have to care about memory allocation etc. Once student touch C will be another extreme. Memory allocation now is important, assigning var with wrong format and precision will cause C application to crash.

ICT1001 doesn't teach how to write stored procedure and other more advanced SQL statement such as left join, right join, union etc, while project if you know these trick, it can decrease the burden of writing inefficient codes.

The bonus points, applicable to programmes not requiring a pre-entry interview, will be added to the student’s University Admission Score. " http://news.nus.edu.sg/highlights/nu...on-initiatives NUS applicants to get bonus points for 1st-choice courses Passion for a field of study will count for admission to the National University of Singapore (NUS) from this year. Those applying for a place at NUS will be given 1.25 bonus points for their first choice - equivalent to going from C to B or B to A in an A-level H1 subject. This applies only to courses where entry is based purely on converting a student's grades into points, and not to courses such as medicine and law where students are assessed on their aptitude and interests through interviews. NUS senior deputy president and provost Ho Teck Hua, who announced the move at a press conference on Monday, said NUS analysis of admission data showed the bonus point can make a difference. "Let's say one student with 81 points applies for communications as his first choice, and another with 82 points applies to the same course as his second choice. With the 1.25 points, the student who lists the course as his first choice will get ahead of the person with 82 points," he said. On why NUS decided on the move, he said: "If you have done well and are passionate about a career in business or computing, for example, then we want to say to you that we support your passion." "We want to help you pursue your passion," he said, adding that students passionate about what they study tend to perform better. Professor Ho revealed that, currently, 65 per cent of students given a place in their first-choice course take up the offer, while only 45 per cent of those given their second-choice course do so. Noting NUS graduates' good job prospects, Prof Ho also announced that NUS will be increasing the number of double majors to increase career options for its graduates. "The nature of work is changing very rapidly, and we need to prepare students for a lifetime of diverse careers," he said. He said NUS, which currently offers 94 double major and major-minor combinations, will add another 86 such programmes. "Someone doing data science and entrepreneurship, for example, can go and work for a range of industries in data science, and also go and do a start-up." On top of the double majors, NUS also offers 71 double degrees, 33 joint degrees with partner universities and 24 concurrent degrees. Adding all this, currently 15 per cent of NUS students are trained in more than one discipline. Prof Ho said he hopes half of all NUS students will graduate with knowledge and skills in two different fields, so they will have more job offers to choose from. He also announced two new degree programmes for this year, one in pharmaceutical science and the other in veterinary science. Students taking up the 5 1/2-year concurrent veterinary degree programme will graduate with an NUS degree in life sciences and a Doctor of Veterinary Medicine from the University of Melbourne. NUS, which now offers 230 bond-free merit scholarships, will add 200 more scholarships for the new academic year. Ms Geraldine Tan, 19, welcomed the move by NUS and said it is important for young people to get into a field that excites them. She said: "I really want to study business and maybe go on an overseas college stint as I want to start a social enterprise. Business courses are hard to get into, so I am hoping the bonus points will help me get the edge." Hwa Chong Institution student Hannah Ganesh, 18, said increasing double degree options is good as students can diversify their learning and "challenge themselves".http://www.straitstimes.com/singapor...choice-courses NUS' new offerings BONUS POINTS FOR FIRST CHOICE Students applying to NUS will be given 1.25 bonus points for their first-choice course.

NEW DEGREES A new concurrent degree combines NUS' Bachelor of Science and the Doctor of Veterinary Medicine offered by the University of Melbourne. Students can complete the programmes in 5-1/2 years. NUS is also offering a new joint degree in pharmaceutical science with the University of Dundee in Scotland. The programme is designed to provide students with knowledge and skills for careers in the pharmaceutical, biomedical and consumer healthcare sectors.

Totally agree with you that scholarship should not be awarded based on academic performance only, which I did mention in my earlier post. The primary objective of my earlier post aims to encourage individuals who are currently applying/appealing for admission and/or scholarship - through the sharing of my education journey and the challenges experienced as an individual with a disadvantaged background. Subsequently, the post also seeks to highlight the flaws in the basis of selection for the scholarship interview. Today, institutions are still using a uniform assessment method to evaluate people of diverse backgrounds. The assessment for academic potential is pretty straightforward - cGPA, awards, and other academic achievement obtained from other sources (e.g. competitions, courses, etc.). The tricky part lies in the assessment of non-academic components - institutions seek individuals with certain attributes, qualities, and skills (e.g. leadership, teamwork, entrepreneurship, integrity, sports achievement, etc.). And often, institutions only consider school-related activities and/or co-curricular activities as the samples for their assessment.  On a personal note, I believed that those attributes, qualities, and skillscould also beidentified and assessed through employment experience (e.g. customers' testimonials, appraisals by superiors, awards attained, etc.).  In general, institutions should also look beyond the school-related activities and co-curricular activities when assessing the non-academic components of individuals. Hence, granting more flexibility for underprivileged students whose non-academic profile were considered as "insubstantial" and thereby allowing  them to have the opportunity to share their stories. Ultimately, an interview is all we need.P.s. I'm glad that your hard work paid off, and congrats on securing that scholarship offered by a private company  (I missed the application deadline for private & government scholarship ) To be shortlisted for interview on the government scholarship with 3.5GPA, you must have some really outstanding non-academic achievements! Do you mind to share with us? And hello senior , assuming you are an SMU student (based on the GPA capped at 4.0).

Move on, start thinking what you CAN do instead of leaving things up to fate and worrying over things you cant control. If business is your end goal, start thinking of alternatives; for example maybe taking economica or an arts course but majoring in business and then perhaps appealing for transfer etc, or writing that appeal letter. You can make life alot harder for yourself by focusing on the negative stuff, or to make an excuse for why things didnt go your way. Learn from them, its a choice, YOUR choice.

Before your comments get lost in the sea of comments on this very active forum, let me reply to your rant/concerns. I just want to say that I get you. I totally do. Why? I was once in your position last year. Unknowingly fell into depression during the waiting period from April to May because I waited hopelessly for things that eventually (and obviously) did not come true... Exactly 1 year ago on this date (13 April 2017), I received a devastating offer from NTU — environmental engineering, and that was my last choice. It was supposed to be a celebration, that I received an offer, but it was the absolute last thing I wanted, since it wasn't my first choice, and something that I knew I couldn't accept doing (and was stupid enough to even place it in my choices, ah well).  Subsequently I got rejected by NUS and SMU, because I simply didn't make the cut... With a heavy heart I signed up (late) for private A levels, and as much as I hated the idea of having to retake, having to suffer... I had no choice. I really wanted to prove to myself that I CAN get into local uni. It didn't help when I'm from one of the top JCs, and my friends are moving on happily to overseas unis with unconditional offers, scholarships, or medicine, law, dentistry... you name it. I was utterly alone. And I felt like I was the only loser in my school (and also a disgrace to my school) who had to retake A levels, who couldn't really make the cut for local uni. In the end, ALL my appeals failed. What's new? Reality slapped me hard in the face, and it hurt like a bitch, of course. What could I do? I had to move on. I then spent some time correcting my mindset before I was actually more mentally stable for my exams. But I just have to tell you that you are really doing yourself a huge disfavour right now. Yes you are disappointed, you are not receiving news, everything seems oh so damn hopeless. But self pity will only kill you, as well as the people around you who love and care for you... do know that YOU are not the only one suffering, your family and friends are too! Everything seems bleak right now yes, but once you get that offer, everything will be merry and bright...  For me, I knew that I wanted to go to uni. I spent that one more year not just preparing for retake, but also redefining my goals and aspirations in my life. Also, building on my character. Depression no more! There were many sacrifices made, many times that I felt like hiding in a cave... but I overcame that and grew so much stronger. As long as you YEARN it, you will get it no matter what, because no one can stop you!! So don't even let the demons in your head stop you, please do not give in to depression. No one can help you except yourself. I suggest you try meditation and yoga, those things saved my ass (': And here I am back this year, legitly exactly one year later. I received my offer from NTU business...... It took one more year, but it was so worth it. Although my story might not be the most impressive one, but I've proved to everyone and most importantly myself that if I want something, I'm gonna make sure I get it, even if it means one year later. Because this is my future, and I am the captain of my ship of fate. I hope that you realise this too, be proud of who you are, of your battlescars, failures and experiences. All these will shape you into who you are — a better you. Chin up!! ",14.834825498793322

I heard from a senior in fass that 1 module in fass is about 1 lecture & 1 tutorial per week btw. The benefits of smu: 1. You get to interact and actively engage yourself during lessons. 2. More internship and exchange opportunities than nus. 3. Many students take double majors and more % taking double degree. 4. More specialisation tracks. 5. Higher employment and salary on average according to the employment survey. The downsides of smu: 1. Competition in smu is fierce. 2. Less campus life (in terms of hall etc) 3. The % of honours students there is lower than fass as it is harder to achieve honours in smu. 4. Less opportunities to make friends (Depends on your personality) The advantages of fass: 1. Lecture-tutorial style of learning, good for shy students who prefer mugging in a corner 2. Higher % of honours 3. Greater cohort size >> bell curve affects students less 3. You can take double majors too by DA or in the 2nd/3rd year 4. More campus life 5. Can stay in RC/hall etc. 6. For eg. econs is more academic and math inclined 7. World QS ranking The disadvantages of NUS: 1. Must find internships & exchange opportunities via the student (?) office. 2. Heavier and more modules esp for double major students (be prepared). I was offered double majors via DA, I counted 4 more modules for NUS than smu for the same double major combination. 3. More in depth and harder modules than smu (from my senior). 4. Hall/RC life may affect your academics. 5. Less specialisation tracks than smu.  Disclaimer ** What I think is subjective, I don’t mean to offend any NUS/SMU students reading this 😅 This is the summary of my ‘research’ haha xD. I am also deciding between nus and smu. Currently reading some year 1 stuff to see which one I like more I got SMU econs,  NUS FASS DMP and NBS offer tooWow your research is so detailed! Haha  Some things I would like to clarify for the benefit of everyone, which is based on my own knowledge and experience talking to friends across all 3 universities.  First and foremost, please take the employment surveys as a pinch of salt. Your salary won't be guaranteed to be higher just because you are enrolled in a particular university that is reported to have higher gross starting pay. Trust me,  when I was deciding on uni like you guys many years ago, I was affected by the graduate employment survey as well but then after years in uni and finally working,  I realised the survey might be misleading... Just so you know, most of these times when the graduates answer these surveys, the schools don't even check whether the pay you entered is true or not...How much you will get for your starting pay depends on your EXPERIENCE, your GRADES, your NEGOTIATION SKILLS, the ECONOMIC OUTLOOK at that POINT IN TIME,  the INDUSTRY and JOB SCOPE. Which uni honestly doesn't matter, cos all 3 local unis are considered on par to one another in the employers' eyes.  and it's just gross pay. There are other components in a salary package like bonuses and benefits which are not captured in the employment surveys. Some people may have a lower gross pay but may have higher bonuses and benefits (eg more days of leave) than someone with higher gross pay who may have less attractive bonuses and benefits. And many times, these surveys are not even representative of the whole student population as not all 100% of the graduating cohort would have completed the survey. Maybe it's just that small handful of students who did the survey and skewed the data?  regarding the point about students in nus being only able to source for internships from career office... That is not true at all. You can always self source (meaning you apply via websites like linkedin for eg by yourself) Oh and student exchange definitely must apply via student office regardless of whether is it nus ntu or smu... Cos all uni already have a list of overseas exchange partner universities that students can apply to then the student office will facilitate the process lor. The process is more or less the same across all 3 uni de.  And one more thing about nus I thought is worth mentioning, they have this NUS Overseas College (NOC) programme where you get to spend 1 year overseas studying and interning... You get to accumulate overseas work exp and clear modules like exchange as well. And the internships are paid. And there are many countries u can go to via this programme - Europe, Asia, USA. Do look it up. I kinda regretted not going 😭 cos it's such a valuable opportunity esp if u are passionate about entrepreneurship.Even if u are not its fine it's still great overseas exposure and it value adds to your resume! Oh and every school is competitive, not just SMU because regardless of which course or uni you go to, the bell curve is everywhere.  Choose your school based on the curriculum, the non academic opportunities available and the culture. Talk to seniors Or students who are studying in the universities and courses you have in mind to find out more. Talk to the recent students who have just graduated to find out more about the actual employment prospects and salary trends across the various unis and courses.  Hope this helps more people to come to a decision on which school to choose.",14.178989242136945

Its not surprising that these people end up getting rejected after being interviewed. Edit: One thing that I need to mention is the program is in NO WAY designed that you NEED to know how to code before coming. Saying so is discrediting the professors that work hard to design the program.  The ramp up is fast I admit, but thats the nature of computer science ask anyone in nus/ntu comp sci or smu is, they will tell you the same thing. The first semester subject starts the knowledge train from SCRATCH. If you don't believe me, ask the famous yanying/guyz92 to send you the first few lectures for 1002, which module title is literally programming fundamentals.  I challenge anyone who has seen that to tell me that its not meant for someone with 0 background in coding. The professors themselves reiterate in the first lecture to tell us not to worry if you have no background because they will teach the basics to you. Agreed on the part for ICT1002 Programming Fundamental, Python is for beginners to learn as var in Python is loosely assign, don't have to care about memory allocation etc. Once student touch C will be another extreme. Memory allocation now is important, assigning var with wrong format and precision will cause C application to crash. For ICT1004, given 4 weeks to create a scheduling system in PHP, SQL, CSS3,HTML5 following the semantic requirements, JavaScript/jQuery. If you are unlucky that 2 of out of 4 teammates not contribute much, you will having the feeling of a sinking boat. Just a project in ICT1004 implement all this different language.  If you are totally new to programming, having ICT1001 supplement these knowledge such as SQL query statement. ICT1001 doesn't teach how to write stored procedure and other more advanced SQL statement such as left join, right join, union etc, while project if you know these trick, it can decrease the burden of writing inefficient codes. Also freeloader in ICT is another problem, playing taichi and act blur not contributing to project while others doing the project, they use the time to study for class test and exam. Also known as "being carried". During exam for the first trimester, some wrote C code in PHP question, PHP code in Python question, Python code in JavaScript.

The bonus points, applicable to programmes not requiring a pre-entry interview, will be added to the student’s University Admission Score. " http://news.nus.edu.sg/highlights/nu...on-initiatives NUS applicants to get bonus points for 1st-choice courses Passion for a field of study will count for admission to the National University of Singapore (NUS) from this year. Those applying for a place at NUS will be given 1.25 bonus points for their first choice - equivalent to going from C to B or B to A in an A-level H1 subject. This applies only to courses where entry is based purely on converting a student's grades into points, and not to courses such as medicine and law where students are assessed on their aptitude and interests through interviews. NUS senior deputy president and provost Ho Teck Hua, who announced the move at a press conference on Monday, said NUS analysis of admission data showed the bonus point can make a difference. "Let's say one student with 81 points applies for communications as his first choice, and another with 82 points applies to the same course as his second choice. With the 1.25 points, the student who lists the course as his first choice will get ahead of the person with 82 points," he said. On why NUS decided on the move, he said: "If you have done well and are passionate about a career in business or computing, for example, then we want to say to you that we support your passion." "We want to help you pursue your passion," he said, adding that students passionate about what they study tend to perform better. Professor Ho revealed that, currently, 65 per cent of students given a place in their first-choice course take up the offer, while only 45 per cent of those given their second-choice course do so. Noting NUS graduates' good job prospects, Prof Ho also announced that NUS will be increasing the number of double majors to increase career options for its graduates. "The nature of work is changing very rapidly, and we need to prepare students for a lifetime of diverse careers," he said. He said NUS, which currently offers 94 double major and major-minor combinations, will add another 86 such programmes. "Someone doing data science and entrepreneurship, for example, can go and work for a range of industries in data science, and also go and do a start-up." On top of the double majors, NUS also offers 71 double degrees, 33 joint degrees with partner universities and 24 concurrent degrees. Adding all this, currently 15 per cent of NUS students are trained in more than one discipline. Prof Ho said he hopes half of all NUS students will graduate with knowledge and skills in two different fields, so they will have more job offers to choose from. He also announced two new degree programmes for this year, one in pharmaceutical science and the other in veterinary science. Students taking up the 5 1/2-year concurrent veterinary degree programme will graduate with an NUS degree in life sciences and a Doctor of Veterinary Medicine from the University of Melbourne. NUS, which now offers 230 bond-free merit scholarships, will add 200 more scholarships for the new academic year. Ms Geraldine Tan, 19, welcomed the move by NUS and said it is important for young people to get into a field that excites them. She said: "I really want to study business and maybe go on an overseas college stint as I want to start a social enterprise. Business courses are hard to get into, so I am hoping the bonus points will help me get the edge." Hwa Chong Institution student Hannah Ganesh, 18, said increasing double degree options is good as students can diversify their learning and "challenge themselves".http://www.straitstimes.com/singapor...choice-courses NUS' new offerings BONUS POINTS FOR FIRST CHOICE Students applying to NUS will be given 1.25 bonus points for their first-choice course. This applies only to courses where entry is based purely on students' grades. MORE DOUBLE MAJORS NUS will be increasing the number of double majors to open up more career options for its graduates. It currently offers 94 double major and major-minor combinations and will add another 86 such programmes. NEW DEGREES A new concurrent degree combines NUS' Bachelor of Science and the Doctor of Veterinary Medicine offered by the University of Melbourne. Students can complete the programmes in 5-1/2 years. NUS is also offering a new joint degree in pharmaceutical science with the University of Dundee in Scotland. The programme is designed to provide students with knowledge and skills for careers in the pharmaceutical, biomedical and consumer healthcare sectors.

Totally agree with you that scholarship should not be awarded based on academic performance only, which I did mention in my earlier post. The primary objective of my earlier post aims to encourage individuals who are currently applying/appealing for admission and/or scholarship - through the sharing of my education journey and the challenges experienced as an individual with a disadvantaged background. Subsequently, the post also seeks to highlight the flaws in the basis of selection for the scholarship interview. Today, institutions are still using a uniform assessment method to evaluate people of diverse backgrounds. The assessment for academic potential is pretty straightforward - cGPA, awards, and other academic achievement obtained from other sources (e.g. competitions, courses, etc.). The tricky part lies in the assessment of non-academic components - institutions seek individuals with certain attributes, qualities, and skills (e.g. leadership, teamwork, entrepreneurship, integrity, sports achievement, etc.). And often, institutions only consider school-related activities and/or co-curricular activities as the samples for their assessment.  On a personal note, I believed that those attributes, qualities, and skillscould also beidentified and assessed through employment experience (e.g. customers' testimonials, appraisals by superiors, awards attained, etc.).  In general, institutions should also look beyond the school-related activities and co-curricular activities when assessing the non-academic components of individuals. Hence, granting more flexibility for underprivileged students whose non-academic profile were considered as "insubstantial" and thereby allowing  them to have the opportunity to share their stories. Ultimately, an interview is all we need.P.s. I'm glad that your hard work paid off, and congrats on securing that scholarship offered by a private company  (I missed the application deadline for private & government scholarship ) To be shortlisted for interview on the government scholarship with 3.5GPA, you must have some really outstanding non-academic achievements! Do you mind to share with us? And hello senior , assuming you are an SMU student (based on the GPA capped at 4.0). As an individual with similar experience, juggling between full-time work and study is really no joke, not to mention that you are doing it at the University-level and still managed to scored a decent grade. Mind to share what full-time job you work as? Do you study in the day, and work at night/after-school hours? Did you, perhaps, packed all modules into that few days so that you could work for the rest of the days in the week? Sincerely hope that you can share some tips with us/me Networking/cloud computing consultant.

Before your comments get lost in the sea of comments on this very active forum, let me reply to your rant/concerns. I just want to say that I get you. I totally do. Why? I was once in your position last year. Unknowingly fell into depression during the waiting period from April to May because I waited hopelessly for things that eventually (and obviously) did not come true... Exactly 1 year ago on this date (13 April 2017), I received a devastating offer from NTU — environmental engineering, and that was my last choice. It was supposed to be a celebration, that I received an offer, but it was the absolute last thing I wanted, since it wasn't my first choice, and something that I knew I couldn't accept doing (and was stupid enough to even place it in my choices, ah well).  Subsequently I got rejected by NUS and SMU, because I simply didn't make the cut... With a heavy heart I signed up (late) for private A levels, and as much as I hated the idea of having to retake, having to suffer... I had no choice. I really wanted to prove to myself that I CAN get into local uni. It didn't help when I'm from one of the top JCs, and my friends are moving on happily to overseas unis with unconditional offers, scholarships, or medicine, law, dentistry... you name it. I was utterly alone. And I felt like I was the only loser in my school (and also a disgrace to my school) who had to retake A levels, who couldn't really make the cut for local uni. In the end, ALL my appeals failed. What's new? Reality slapped me hard in the face, and it hurt like a bitch, of course. What could I do? I had to move on. I then spent some time correcting my mindset before I was actually more mentally stable for my exams. But I just have to tell you that you are really doing yourself a huge disfavour right now. Yes you are disappointed, you are not receiving news, everything seems oh so damn hopeless. But self pity will only kill you, as well as the people around you who love and care for you... do know that YOU are not the only one suffering, your family and friends are too! Everything seems bleak right now yes, but once you get that offer, everything will be merry and bright...  For me, I knew that I wanted to go to uni. I spent that one more year not just preparing for retake, but also redefining my goals and aspirations in my life. Also, building on my character. Depression no more! There were many sacrifices made, many times that I felt like hiding in a cave... but I overcame that and grew so much stronger. As long as you YEARN it, you will get it no matter what, because no one can stop you!! So don't even let the demons in your head stop you, please do not give in to depression. No one can help you except yourself. I suggest you try meditation and yoga, those things saved my ass (': And here I am back this year, legitly exactly one year later. I received my offer from NTU business...... It took one more year, but it was so worth it. Although my story might not be the most impressive one, but I've proved to everyone and most importantly myself that if I want something, I'm gonna make sure I get it, even if it means one year later. Because this is my future, and I am the captain of my ship of fate. I hope that you realise this too, be proud of who you are, of your battlescars, failures and experiences. All these will shape you into who you are — a better you. Chin up!! ",14.834825498793322

I heard from a senior in fass that 1 module in fass is about 1 lecture & 1 tutorial per week btw. The benefits of smu: 1. You get to interact and actively engage yourself during lessons. 2. More internship and exchange opportunities than nus. 3. Many students take double majors and more % taking double degree. 4. More specialisation tracks. 5. Higher employment and salary on average according to the employment survey. The downsides of smu: 1. Competition in smu is fierce. 2. Less campus life (in terms of hall etc) 3. The % of honours students there is lower than fass as it is harder to achieve honours in smu. 4. Less opportunities to make friends (Depends on your personality) The advantages of fass: 1. Lecture-tutorial style of learning, good for shy students who prefer mugging in a corner 2. Higher % of honours 3. Greater cohort size >> bell curve affects students less 3. You can take double majors too by DA or in the 2nd/3rd year 4. More campus life 5. Can stay in RC/hall etc. 6. For eg. econs is more academic and math inclined 7. World QS ranking The disadvantages of NUS: 1. Must find internships & exchange opportunities via the student (?) office. 2. Heavier and more modules esp for double major students (be prepared). I was offered double majors via DA, I counted 4 more modules for NUS than smu for the same double major combination. 3. More in depth and harder modules than smu (from my senior). 4. Hall/RC life may affect your academics. 5. Less specialisation tracks than smu.  Disclaimer ** What I think is subjective, I don’t mean to offend any NUS/SMU students reading this 😅 This is the summary of my ‘research’ haha xD. I am also deciding between nus and smu. Currently reading some year 1 stuff to see which one I like more I got SMU econs,  NUS FASS DMP and NBS offer tooWow your research is so detailed! Haha  Some things I would like to clarify for the benefit of everyone, which is based on my own knowledge and experience talking to friends across all 3 universities.  First and foremost, please take the employment surveys as a pinch of salt. Your salary won't be guaranteed to be higher just because you are enrolled in a particular university that is reported to have higher gross starting pay. Trust me,  when I was deciding on uni like you guys many years ago, I was affected by the graduate employment survey as well but then after years in uni and finally working,  I realised the survey might be misleading... Just so you know, most of these times when the graduates answer these surveys, the schools don't even check whether the pay you entered is true or not...How much you will get for your starting pay depends on your EXPERIENCE, your GRADES, your NEGOTIATION SKILLS, the ECONOMIC OUTLOOK at that POINT IN TIME,  the INDUSTRY and JOB SCOPE. Which uni honestly doesn't matter, cos all 3 local unis are considered on par to one another in the employers' eyes.  and it's just gross pay. There are other components in a salary package like bonuses and benefits which are not captured in the employment surveys. Some people may have a lower gross pay but may have higher bonuses and benefits (eg more days of leave) than someone with higher gross pay who may have less attractive bonuses and benefits. And many times, these surveys are not even representative of the whole student population as not all 100% of the graduating cohort would have completed the survey. Maybe it's just that small handful of students who did the survey and skewed the data?  regarding the point about students in nus being only able to source for internships from career office... That is not true at all. You can always self source (meaning you apply via websites like linkedin for eg by yourself) Oh and student exchange definitely must apply via student office regardless of whether is it nus ntu or smu... Cos all uni already have a list of overseas exchange partner universities that students can apply to then the student office will facilitate the process lor. The process is more or less the same across all 3 uni de.  And one more thing about nus I thought is worth mentioning, they have this NUS Overseas College (NOC) programme where you get to spend 1 year overseas studying and interning... You get to accumulate overseas work exp and clear modules like exchange as well. And the internships are paid. And there are many countries u can go to via this programme - Europe, Asia, USA. Do look it up. I kinda regretted not going 😭 cos it's such a valuable opportunity esp if u are passionate about entrepreneurship.Even if u are not its fine it's still great overseas exposure and it value adds to your resume! Oh and every school is competitive, not just SMU because regardless of which course or uni you go to, the bell curve is everywhere.  Choose your school based on the curriculum, the non academic opportunities available and the culture. Talk to seniors Or students who are studying in the universities and courses you have in mind to find out more. Talk to the recent students who have just graduated to find out more about the actual employment prospects and salary trends across the various unis and courses.  Hope this helps more people to come to a decision on which school to choose.",14.178989242136945

The bonus points, applicable to programmes not requiring a pre-entry interview, will be added to the student’s University Admission Score. " http://news.nus.edu.sg/highlights/nu...on-initiatives NUS applicants to get bonus points for 1st-choice courses Passion for a field of study will count for admission to the National University of Singapore (NUS) from this year. Those applying for a place at NUS will be given 1.25 bonus points for their first choice - equivalent to going from C to B or B to A in an A-level H1 subject. This applies only to courses where entry is based purely on converting a student's grades into points, and not to courses such as medicine and law where students are assessed on their aptitude and interests through interviews. NUS senior deputy president and provost Ho Teck Hua, who announced the move at a press conference on Monday, said NUS analysis of admission data showed the bonus point can make a difference. "Let's say one student with 81 points applies for communications as his first choice, and another with 82 points applies to the same course as his second choice. With the 1.25 points, the student who lists the course as his first choice will get ahead of the person with 82 points," he said. On why NUS decided on the move, he said: "If you have done well and are passionate about a career in business or computing, for example, then we want to say to you that we support your passion." "We want to help you pursue your passion," he said, adding that students passionate about what they study tend to perform better. Professor Ho revealed that, currently, 65 per cent of students given a place in their first-choice course take up the offer, while only 45 per cent of those given their second-choice course do so. Noting NUS graduates' good job prospects, Prof Ho also announced that NUS will be increasing the number of double majors to increase career options for its graduates. "The nature of work is changing very rapidly, and we need to prepare students for a lifetime of diverse careers," he said. He said NUS, which currently offers 94 double major and major-minor combinations, will add another 86 such programmes. "Someone doing data science and entrepreneurship, for example, can go and work for a range of industries in data science, and also go and do a start-up." On top of the double majors, NUS also offers 71 double degrees, 33 joint degrees with partner universities and 24 concurrent degrees. Adding all this, currently 15 per cent of NUS students are trained in more than one discipline. Prof Ho said he hopes half of all NUS students will graduate with knowledge and skills in two different fields, so they will have more job offers to choose from. He also announced two new degree programmes for this year, one in pharmaceutical science and the other in veterinary science. Students taking up the 5 1/2-year concurrent veterinary degree programme will graduate with an NUS degree in life sciences and a Doctor of Veterinary Medicine from the University of Melbourne. NUS, which now offers 230 bond-free merit scholarships, will add 200 more scholarships for the new academic year. Ms Geraldine Tan, 19, welcomed the move by NUS and said it is important for young people to get into a field that excites them. She said: "I really want to study business and maybe go on an overseas college stint as I want to start a social enterprise. Business courses are hard to get into, so I am hoping the bonus points will help me get the edge." Hwa Chong Institution student Hannah Ganesh, 18, said increasing double degree options is good as students can diversify their learning and "challenge themselves".http://www.straitstimes.com/singapor...choice-courses NUS' new offerings BONUS POINTS FOR FIRST CHOICE Students applying to NUS will be given 1.25 bonus points for their first-choice course. This applies only to courses where entry is based purely on students' grades. MORE DOUBLE MAJORS NUS will be increasing the number of double majors to open up more career options for its graduates. It currently offers 94 double major and major-minor combinations and will add another 86 such programmes. NEW DEGREES A new concurrent degree combines NUS' Bachelor of Science and the Doctor of Veterinary Medicine offered by the University of Melbourne. Students can complete the programmes in 5-1/2 years. NUS is also offering a new joint degree in pharmaceutical science with the University of Dundee in Scotland. The programme is designed to provide students with knowledge and skills for careers in the pharmaceutical, biomedical and consumer healthcare sectors. NUS OVERSEAS COLLEGES The programme that sends students on internships to several entrepreneurial hubs in the world will be extended to Jakarta and Toronto. MORE BOND-FREE SCHOLARSHIPS NUS, which now offers 230 bond-free merit scholarships, will add another 200 scholarships in the new academic year. ",12.61357862747964

The reason for this is they design the program in such a way that you need to know how to code before enroll to the program. ICT SE and IS is very intensive, beginners will have a hard time to catch up. For example, one of our project is to write a web crawler and do data analysis and come out application(s) in C++, it must complete within 4 weeks. Those who have zero programming background will suffer very badly. The lecture slides only teach you how to sit, but project expect you to fly. We have other project running concurrently, including class test. Once project submission is up, next week (two days later) our first exam paper. ICT student with a different perspective here. Yes the director said that. Yes the deadlines are like that.  But, noone said you can't submit projects early. Also this is university. Anyone who expects projects to be scoped to only what is learnt in lectures needs a wake up call. Also, the fear mongering here is a little overdone. Its all about the aptitude for absorbing information. I know a guy from an unrelated diploma with 0 coding knowledge on track for first class while a 3.6 it diploma person is struggling to pass. I come from a decent secondary school. 80% of my class went to A levels. Majority dont even consider SIT. Those good enough to go to NTU SMU NUS SUTD will go there instead. The students in ICT right now are basically guinea pigs. Its a risk they dont have to take.  For those that don't do well enough probably don't like studying altogether and would rather go to sim for a faster degree or will choose to retake a levels. That leaves us with the ones that do badly for A levels and are desperate to get into a 'local uni' without wasting time.

Totally agree with you that scholarship should not be awarded based on academic performance only, which I did mention in my earlier post. The primary objective of my earlier post aims to encourage individuals who are currently applying/appealing for admission and/or scholarship - through the sharing of my education journey and the challenges experienced as an individual with a disadvantaged background. Subsequently, the post also seeks to highlight the flaws in the basis of selection for the scholarship interview. Today, institutions are still using a uniform assessment method to evaluate people of diverse backgrounds. The assessment for academic potential is pretty straightforward - cGPA, awards, and other academic achievement obtained from other sources (e.g. competitions, courses, etc.). The tricky part lies in the assessment of non-academic components - institutions seek individuals with certain attributes, qualities, and skills (e.g. leadership, teamwork, entrepreneurship, integrity, sports achievement, etc.). And often, institutions only consider school-related activities and/or co-curricular activities as the samples for their assessment.  On a personal note, I believed that those attributes, qualities, and skillscould also beidentified and assessed through employment experience (e.g. customers' testimonials, appraisals by superiors, awards attained, etc.).  In general, institutions should also look beyond the school-related activities and co-curricular activities when assessing the non-academic components of individuals. Hence, granting more flexibility for underprivileged students whose non-academic profile were considered as "insubstantial" and thereby allowing  them to have the opportunity to share their stories. Ultimately, an interview is all we need.P.s. I'm glad that your hard work paid off, and congrats on securing that scholarship offered by a private company  (I missed the application deadline for private & government scholarship ) To be shortlisted for interview on the government scholarship with 3.5GPA, you must have some really outstanding non-academic achievements! Do you mind to share with us? And hello senior , assuming you are an SMU student (based on the GPA capped at 4.0). As an individual with similar experience, juggling between full-time work and study is really no joke, not to mention that you are doing it at the University-level and still managed to scored a decent grade. Mind to share what full-time job you work as? Do you study in the day, and work at night/after-school hours? Did you, perhaps, packed all modules into that few days so that you could work for the rest of the days in the week? Sincerely hope that you can share some tips with us/me Networking/cloud computing consultant.

Before your comments get lost in the sea of comments on this very active forum, let me reply to your rant/concerns. I just want to say that I get you. I totally do. Why? I was once in your position last year. Unknowingly fell into depression during the waiting period from April to May because I waited hopelessly for things that eventually (and obviously) did not come true... Exactly 1 year ago on this date (13 April 2017), I received a devastating offer from NTU — environmental engineering, and that was my last choice. It was supposed to be a celebration, that I received an offer, but it was the absolute last thing I wanted, since it wasn't my first choice, and something that I knew I couldn't accept doing (and was stupid enough to even place it in my choices, ah well).  Subsequently I got rejected by NUS and SMU, because I simply didn't make the cut... With a heavy heart I signed up (late) for private A levels, and as much as I hated the idea of having to retake, having to suffer... I had no choice. I really wanted to prove to myself that I CAN get into local uni. It didn't help when I'm from one of the top JCs, and my friends are moving on happily to overseas unis with unconditional offers, scholarships, or medicine, law, dentistry... you name it. I was utterly alone. And I felt like I was the only loser in my school (and also a disgrace to my school) who had to retake A levels, who couldn't really make the cut for local uni. In the end, ALL my appeals failed. What's new? Reality slapped me hard in the face, and it hurt like a bitch, of course. What could I do? I had to move on. I then spent some time correcting my mindset before I was actually more mentally stable for my exams. But I just have to tell you that you are really doing yourself a huge disfavour right now. Yes you are disappointed, you are not receiving news, everything seems oh so damn hopeless. But self pity will only kill you, as well as the people around you who love and care for you... do know that YOU are not the only one suffering, your family and friends are too! Everything seems bleak right now yes, but once you get that offer, everything will be merry and bright...  For me, I knew that I wanted to go to uni. I spent that one more year not just preparing for retake, but also redefining my goals and aspirations in my life. Also, building on my character. Depression no more! There were many sacrifices made, many times that I felt like hiding in a cave... but I overcame that and grew so much stronger. As long as you YEARN it, you will get it no matter what, because no one can stop you!! So don't even let the demons in your head stop you, please do not give in to depression. No one can help you except yourself. I suggest you try meditation and yoga, those things saved my ass (': And here I am back this year, legitly exactly one year later. I received my offer from NTU business...... It took one more year, but it was so worth it. Although my story might not be the most impressive one, but I've proved to everyone and most importantly myself that if I want something, I'm gonna make sure I get it, even if it means one year later. Because this is my future, and I am the captain of my ship of fate. I hope that you realise this too, be proud of who you are, of your battlescars, failures and experiences. All these will shape you into who you are — a better you. Chin up!! ",14.834825498793322

I heard from a senior in fass that 1 module in fass is about 1 lecture & 1 tutorial per week btw. The benefits of smu: 1. You get to interact and actively engage yourself during lessons. 2. More internship and exchange opportunities than nus. 3. Many students take double majors and more % taking double degree. 4. More specialisation tracks. 5. Higher employment and salary on average according to the employment survey. The downsides of smu: 1. Competition in smu is fierce. 2. Less campus life (in terms of hall etc) 3. The % of honours students there is lower than fass as it is harder to achieve honours in smu. 4. Less opportunities to make friends (Depends on your personality) The advantages of fass: 1. Lecture-tutorial style of learning, good for shy students who prefer mugging in a corner 2. Higher % of honours 3. Greater cohort size >> bell curve affects students less 3. You can take double majors too by DA or in the 2nd/3rd year 4. More campus life 5. Can stay in RC/hall etc. 6. For eg. econs is more academic and math inclined 7. World QS ranking The disadvantages of NUS: 1. Must find internships & exchange opportunities via the student (?) office. 2. Heavier and more modules esp for double major students (be prepared). I was offered double majors via DA, I counted 4 more modules for NUS than smu for the same double major combination. 3. More in depth and harder modules than smu (from my senior). 4. Hall/RC life may affect your academics. 5. Less specialisation tracks than smu.  Disclaimer ** What I think is subjective, I don’t mean to offend any NUS/SMU students reading this 😅 This is the summary of my ‘research’ haha xD. I am also deciding between nus and smu. Currently reading some year 1 stuff to see which one I like more I got SMU econs,  NUS FASS DMP and NBS offer tooWow your research is so detailed! Haha  Some things I would like to clarify for the benefit of everyone, which is based on my own knowledge and experience talking to friends across all 3 universities.  First and foremost, please take the employment surveys as a pinch of salt. Your salary won't be guaranteed to be higher just because you are enrolled in a particular university that is reported to have higher gross starting pay. Trust me,  when I was deciding on uni like you guys many years ago, I was affected by the graduate employment survey as well but then after years in uni and finally working,  I realised the survey might be misleading... Just so you know, most of these times when the graduates answer these surveys, the schools don't even check whether the pay you entered is true or not...How much you will get for your starting pay depends on your EXPERIENCE, your GRADES, your NEGOTIATION SKILLS, the ECONOMIC OUTLOOK at that POINT IN TIME,  the INDUSTRY and JOB SCOPE. Which uni honestly doesn't matter, cos all 3 local unis are considered on par to one another in the employers' eyes.  and it's just gross pay. There are other components in a salary package like bonuses and benefits which are not captured in the employment surveys. Some people may have a lower gross pay but may have higher bonuses and benefits (eg more days of leave) than someone with higher gross pay who may have less attractive bonuses and benefits. And many times, these surveys are not even representative of the whole student population as not all 100% of the graduating cohort would have completed the survey. Maybe it's just that small handful of students who did the survey and skewed the data?  regarding the point about students in nus being only able to source for internships from career office... That is not true at all. You can always self source (meaning you apply via websites like linkedin for eg by yourself) Oh and student exchange definitely must apply via student office regardless of whether is it nus ntu or smu... Cos all uni already have a list of overseas exchange partner universities that students can apply to then the student office will facilitate the process lor. The process is more or less the same across all 3 uni de.  And one more thing about nus I thought is worth mentioning, they have this NUS Overseas College (NOC) programme where you get to spend 1 year overseas studying and interning... You get to accumulate overseas work exp and clear modules like exchange as well. And the internships are paid. And there are many countries u can go to via this programme - Europe, Asia, USA. Do look it up. I kinda regretted not going 😭 cos it's such a valuable opportunity esp if u are passionate about entrepreneurship.Even if u are not its fine it's still great overseas exposure and it value adds to your resume! Oh and every school is competitive, not just SMU because regardless of which course or uni you go to, the bell curve is everywhere.  Choose your school based on the curriculum, the non academic opportunities available and the culture. Talk to seniors Or students who are studying in the universities and courses you have in mind to find out more. Talk to the recent students who have just graduated to find out more about the actual employment prospects and salary trends across the various unis and courses.  Hope this helps more people to come to a decision on which school to choose.",14.178989242136945

Thanks whuttt wrote:  Good news for those borderline cases eyeing NUS " . . . . the plan to award up to 1.25 bonus points (equivalent of one H1 grade) to students applying for their first choice programme. The bonus points, applicable to programmes not requiring a pre-entry interview, will be added to the student’s University Admission Score. " http://news.nus.edu.sg/highlights/nu...on-initiatives NUS applicants to get bonus points for 1st-choice courses Passion for a field of study will count for admission to the National University of Singapore (NUS) from this year. Those applying for a place at NUS will be given 1.25 bonus points for their first choice - equivalent to going from C to B or B to A in an A-level H1 subject. This applies only to courses where entry is based purely on converting a student's grades into points, and not to courses such as medicine and law where students are assessed on their aptitude and interests through interviews. NUS senior deputy president and provost Ho Teck Hua, who announced the move at a press conference on Monday, said NUS analysis of admission data showed the bonus point can make a difference. "Let's say one student with 81 points applies for communications as his first choice, and another with 82 points applies to the same course as his second choice. With the 1.25 points, the student who lists the course as his first choice will get ahead of the person with 82 points," he said. On why NUS decided on the move, he said: "If you have done well and are passionate about a career in business or computing, for example, then we want to say to you that we support your passion." "We want to help you pursue your passion," he said, adding that students passionate about what they study tend to perform better. Professor Ho revealed that, currently, 65 per cent of students given a place in their first-choice course take up the offer, while only 45 per cent of those given their second-choice course do so. Noting NUS graduates' good job prospects, Prof Ho also announced that NUS will be increasing the number of double majors to increase career options for its graduates. "The nature of work is changing very rapidly, and we need to prepare students for a lifetime of diverse careers," he said. He said NUS, which currently offers 94 double major and major-minor combinations, will add another 86 such programmes. "Someone doing data science and entrepreneurship, for example, can go and work for a range of industries in data science, and also go and do a start-up." On top of the double majors, NUS also offers 71 double degrees, 33 joint degrees with partner universities and 24 concurrent degrees. Adding all this, currently 15 per cent of NUS students are trained in more than one discipline. Prof Ho said he hopes half of all NUS students will graduate with knowledge and skills in two different fields, so they will have more job offers to choose from. He also announced two new degree programmes for this year, one in pharmaceutical science and the other in veterinary science. Students taking up the 5 1/2-year concurrent veterinary degree programme will graduate with an NUS degree in life sciences and a Doctor of Veterinary Medicine from the University of Melbourne. NUS, which now offers 230 bond-free merit scholarships, will add 200 more scholarships for the new academic year. Ms Geraldine Tan, 19, welcomed the move by NUS and said it is important for young people to get into a field that excites them. She said: "I really want to study business and maybe go on an overseas college stint as I want to start a social enterprise. Business courses are hard to get into, so I am hoping the bonus points will help me get the edge." Hwa Chong Institution student Hannah Ganesh, 18, said increasing double degree options is good as students can diversify their learning and "challenge themselves".http://www.straitstimes.com/singapor...choice-courses NUS' new offerings BONUS POINTS FOR FIRST CHOICE Students applying to NUS will be given 1.25 bonus points for their first-choice course. This applies only to courses where entry is based purely on students' grades. MORE DOUBLE MAJORS NUS will be increasing the number of double majors to open up more career options for its graduates. It currently offers 94 double major and major-minor combinations and will add another 86 such programmes. NEW DEGREES A new concurrent degree combines NUS' Bachelor of Science and the Doctor of Veterinary Medicine offered by the University of Melbourne. Students can complete the programmes in 5-1/2 years. NUS is also offering a new joint degree in pharmaceutical science with the University of Dundee in Scotland. The programme is designed to provide students with knowledge and skills for careers in the pharmaceutical, biomedical and consumer healthcare sectors. NUS OVERSEAS COLLEGES The programme that sends students on internships to several entrepreneurial hubs in the world will be extended to Jakarta and Toronto.

The reason for this is they design the program in such a way that you need to know how to code before enroll to the program. ICT SE and IS is very intensive, beginners will have a hard time to catch up. For example, one of our project is to write a web crawler and do data analysis and come out application(s) in C++, it must complete within 4 weeks. Those who have zero programming background will suffer very badly. The lecture slides only teach you how to sit, but project expect you to fly. We have other project running concurrently, including class test. Once project submission is up, next week (two days later) our first exam paper. ICT student with a different perspective here. Yes the director said that. Yes the deadlines are like that.  But, noone said you can't submit projects early. Also this is university. Anyone who expects projects to be scoped to only what is learnt in lectures needs a wake up call. Also, the fear mongering here is a little overdone. Its all about the aptitude for absorbing information. I know a guy from an unrelated diploma with 0 coding knowledge on track for first class while a 3.6 it diploma person is struggling to pass. I come from a decent secondary school. 80% of my class went to A levels. Majority dont even consider SIT. Those good enough to go to NTU SMU NUS SUTD will go there instead. The students in ICT right now are basically guinea pigs. Its a risk they dont have to take.  For those that don't do well enough probably don't like studying altogether and would rather go to sim for a faster degree or will choose to retake a levels. That leaves us with the ones that do badly for A levels and are desperate to get into a 'local uni' without wasting time. Its not surprising that these people end up getting rejected after being interviewed. Edit: One thing that I need to mention is the program is in NO WAY designed that you NEED to know how to code before coming. Saying so is discrediting the professors that work hard to design the program.  The ramp up is fast I admit, but thats the nature of computer science ask anyone in nus/ntu comp sci or smu is, they will tell you the same thing. The first semester subject starts the knowledge train from SCRATCH. If you don't believe me, ask the famous yanying/guyz92 to send you the first few lectures for 1002, which module title is literally programming fundamentals.  I challenge anyone who has seen that to tell me that its not meant for someone with 0 background in coding. The professors themselves reiterate in the first lecture to tell us not to worry if you have no background because they will teach the basics to you.",12.605195176170959

Totally agree with you that scholarship should not be awarded based on academic performance only, which I did mention in my earlier post. The primary objective of my earlier post aims to encourage individuals who are currently applying/appealing for admission and/or scholarship - through the sharing of my education journey and the challenges experienced as an individual with a disadvantaged background. Subsequently, the post also seeks to highlight the flaws in the basis of selection for the scholarship interview. Today, institutions are still using a uniform assessment method to evaluate people of diverse backgrounds. The assessment for academic potential is pretty straightforward - cGPA, awards, and other academic achievement obtained from other sources (e.g. competitions, courses, etc.). The tricky part lies in the assessment of non-academic components - institutions seek individuals with certain attributes, qualities, and skills (e.g. leadership, teamwork, entrepreneurship, integrity, sports achievement, etc.). And often, institutions only consider school-related activities and/or co-curricular activities as the samples for their assessment.  On a personal note, I believed that those attributes, qualities, and skillscould also beidentified and assessed through employment experience (e.g. customers' testimonials, appraisals by superiors, awards attained, etc.).  In general, institutions should also look beyond the school-related activities and co-curricular activities when assessing the non-academic components of individuals. Hence, granting more flexibility for underprivileged students whose non-academic profile were considered as "insubstantial" and thereby allowing  them to have the opportunity to share their stories. Ultimately, an interview is all we need.P.s. I'm glad that your hard work paid off, and congrats on securing that scholarship offered by a private company  (I missed the application deadline for private & government scholarship ) To be shortlisted for interview on the government scholarship with 3.5GPA, you must have some really outstanding non-academic achievements! Do you mind to share with us? And hello senior , assuming you are an SMU student (based on the GPA capped at 4.0). As an individual with similar experience, juggling between full-time work and study is really no joke, not to mention that you are doing it at the University-level and still managed to scored a decent grade. Mind to share what full-time job you work as? Do you study in the day, and work at night/after-school hours? Did you, perhaps, packed all modules into that few days so that you could work for the rest of the days in the week? Sincerely hope that you can share some tips with us/me Networking/cloud computing consultant.

Before your comments get lost in the sea of comments on this very active forum, let me reply to your rant/concerns. I just want to say that I get you. I totally do. Why? I was once in your position last year. Unknowingly fell into depression during the waiting period from April to May because I waited hopelessly for things that eventually (and obviously) did not come true... Exactly 1 year ago on this date (13 April 2017), I received a devastating offer from NTU — environmental engineering, and that was my last choice. It was supposed to be a celebration, that I received an offer, but it was the absolute last thing I wanted, since it wasn't my first choice, and something that I knew I couldn't accept doing (and was stupid enough to even place it in my choices, ah well).  Subsequently I got rejected by NUS and SMU, because I simply didn't make the cut... With a heavy heart I signed up (late) for private A levels, and as much as I hated the idea of having to retake, having to suffer... I had no choice. I really wanted to prove to myself that I CAN get into local uni. It didn't help when I'm from one of the top JCs, and my friends are moving on happily to overseas unis with unconditional offers, scholarships, or medicine, law, dentistry... you name it. I was utterly alone. And I felt like I was the only loser in my school (and also a disgrace to my school) who had to retake A levels, who couldn't really make the cut for local uni. In the end, ALL my appeals failed. What's new? Reality slapped me hard in the face, and it hurt like a bitch, of course. What could I do? I had to move on. I then spent some time correcting my mindset before I was actually more mentally stable for my exams. But I just have to tell you that you are really doing yourself a huge disfavour right now. Yes you are disappointed, you are not receiving news, everything seems oh so damn hopeless. But self pity will only kill you, as well as the people around you who love and care for you... do know that YOU are not the only one suffering, your family and friends are too! Everything seems bleak right now yes, but once you get that offer, everything will be merry and bright...  For me, I knew that I wanted to go to uni. I spent that one more year not just preparing for retake, but also redefining my goals and aspirations in my life. Also, building on my character. Depression no more! There were many sacrifices made, many times that I felt like hiding in a cave... but I overcame that and grew so much stronger. As long as you YEARN it, you will get it no matter what, because no one can stop you!! So don't even let the demons in your head stop you, please do not give in to depression. No one can help you except yourself. I suggest you try meditation and yoga, those things saved my ass (': And here I am back this year, legitly exactly one year later. I received my offer from NTU business...... It took one more year, but it was so worth it. Although my story might not be the most impressive one, but I've proved to everyone and most importantly myself that if I want something, I'm gonna make sure I get it, even if it means one year later. Because this is my future, and I am the captain of my ship of fate. I hope that you realise this too, be proud of who you are, of your battlescars, failures and experiences. All these will shape you into who you are — a better you. Chin up!! ",14.828258131361054

More internship and exchange opportunities than nus. 3. Many students take double majors and more % taking double degree. 4. More specialisation tracks. 5. Higher employment and salary on average according to the employment survey. The downsides of smu: 1. Competition in smu is fierce. 2. Less campus life (in terms of hall etc) 3. The % of honours students there is lower than fass as it is harder to achieve honours in smu. 4. Less opportunities to make friends (Depends on your personality) The advantages of fass: 1. Lecture-tutorial style of learning, good for shy students who prefer mugging in a corner 2. Higher % of honours 3. Greater cohort size >> bell curve affects students less 3. You can take double majors too by DA or in the 2nd/3rd year 4. More campus life 5. Can stay in RC/hall etc. 6. For eg. econs is more academic and math inclined 7. World QS ranking The disadvantages of NUS: 1. Must find internships & exchange opportunities via the student (?) office. 2. Heavier and more modules esp for double major students (be prepared). I was offered double majors via DA, I counted 4 more modules for NUS than smu for the same double major combination. 3. More in depth and harder modules than smu (from my senior). 4. Hall/RC life may affect your academics. 5. Less specialisation tracks than smu.  Disclaimer ** What I think is subjective, I don’t mean to offend any NUS/SMU students reading this 😅 This is the summary of my ‘research’ haha xD. I am also deciding between nus and smu. Currently reading some year 1 stuff to see which one I like more I got SMU econs,  NUS FASS DMP and NBS offer tooWow your research is so detailed! Haha  Some things I would like to clarify for the benefit of everyone, which is based on my own knowledge and experience talking to friends across all 3 universities.  First and foremost, please take the employment surveys as a pinch of salt. Your salary won't be guaranteed to be higher just because you are enrolled in a particular university that is reported to have higher gross starting pay. Trust me,  when I was deciding on uni like you guys many years ago, I was affected by the graduate employment survey as well but then after years in uni and finally working,  I realised the survey might be misleading... Just so you know, most of these times when the graduates answer these surveys, the schools don't even check whether the pay you entered is true or not...How much you will get for your starting pay depends on your EXPERIENCE, your GRADES, your NEGOTIATION SKILLS, the ECONOMIC OUTLOOK at that POINT IN TIME,  the INDUSTRY and JOB SCOPE. Which uni honestly doesn't matter, cos all 3 local unis are considered on par to one another in the employers' eyes.  and it's just gross pay. There are other components in a salary package like bonuses and benefits which are not captured in the employment surveys. Some people may have a lower gross pay but may have higher bonuses and benefits (eg more days of leave) than someone with higher gross pay who may have less attractive bonuses and benefits. And many times, these surveys are not even representative of the whole student population as not all 100% of the graduating cohort would have completed the survey. Maybe it's just that small handful of students who did the survey and skewed the data?  regarding the point about students in nus being only able to source for internships from career office... That is not true at all. You can always self source (meaning you apply via websites like linkedin for eg by yourself) Oh and student exchange definitely must apply via student office regardless of whether is it nus ntu or smu... Cos all uni already have a list of overseas exchange partner universities that students can apply to then the student office will facilitate the process lor. The process is more or less the same across all 3 uni de.  And one more thing about nus I thought is worth mentioning, they have this NUS Overseas College (NOC) programme where you get to spend 1 year overseas studying and interning... You get to accumulate overseas work exp and clear modules like exchange as well. And the internships are paid. And there are many countries u can go to via this programme - Europe, Asia, USA. Do look it up. I kinda regretted not going 😭 cos it's such a valuable opportunity esp if u are passionate about entrepreneurship.Even if u are not its fine it's still great overseas exposure and it value adds to your resume! Oh and every school is competitive, not just SMU because regardless of which course or uni you go to, the bell curve is everywhere.  Choose your school based on the curriculum, the non academic opportunities available and the culture. Talk to seniors Or students who are studying in the universities and courses you have in mind to find out more. Talk to the recent students who have just graduated to find out more about the actual employment prospects and salary trends across the various unis and courses.  Hope this helps more people to come to a decision on which school to choose.",14.174857056651074

Agreed on the part for ICT1002 Programming Fundamental, Python is for beginners to learn as var in Python is loosely assign, don't have to care about memory allocation etc. Once student touch C will be another extreme. Memory allocation now is important, assigning var with wrong format and precision will cause C application to crash.

If you are totally new to programming, having ICT1001 supplement these knowledge such as SQL query statement. ICT1001 doesn't teach how to write stored procedure and other more advanced SQL statement such as left join, right join, union etc, while project if you know these trick, it can decrease the burden of writing inefficient codes. Also freeloader in ICT is another problem, playing taichi and act blur not contributing to project while others doing the project, they use the time to study for class test and exam.

Thanks whuttt wrote:  Good news for those borderline cases eyeing NUS " . . . . the plan to award up to 1.25 bonus points (equivalent of one H1 grade) to students applying for their first choice programme. The bonus points, applicable to programmes not requiring a pre-entry interview, will be added to the student’s University Admission Score. " http://news.nus.edu.sg/highlights/nu...on-initiatives NUS applicants to get bonus points for 1st-choice courses Passion for a field of study will count for admission to the National University of Singapore (NUS) from this year. Those applying for a place at NUS will be given 1.25 bonus points for their first choice - equivalent to going from C to B or B to A in an A-level H1 subject. This applies only to courses where entry is based purely on converting a student's grades into points, and not to courses such as medicine and law where students are assessed on their aptitude and interests through interviews. NUS senior deputy president and provost Ho Teck Hua, who announced the move at a press conference on Monday, said NUS analysis of admission data showed the bonus point can make a difference. "Let's say one student with 81 points applies for communications as his first choice, and another with 82 points applies to the same course as his second choice. With the 1.25 points, the student who lists the course as his first choice will get ahead of the person with 82 points," he said. On why NUS decided on the move, he said: "If you have done well and are passionate about a career in business or computing, for example, then we want to say to you that we support your passion." "We want to help you pursue your passion," he said, adding that students passionate about what they study tend to perform better. Professor Ho revealed that, currently, 65 per cent of students given a place in their first-choice course take up the offer, while only 45 per cent of those given their second-choice course do so. Noting NUS graduates' good job prospects, Prof Ho also announced that NUS will be increasing the number of double majors to increase career options for its graduates. "The nature of work is changing very rapidly, and we need to prepare students for a lifetime of diverse careers," he said. He said NUS, which currently offers 94 double major and major-minor combinations, will add another 86 such programmes. "Someone doing data science and entrepreneurship, for example, can go and work for a range of industries in data science, and also go and do a start-up." On top of the double majors, NUS also offers 71 double degrees, 33 joint degrees with partner universities and 24 concurrent degrees. Adding all this, currently 15 per cent of NUS students are trained in more than one discipline. Prof Ho said he hopes half of all NUS students will graduate with knowledge and skills in two different fields, so they will have more job offers to choose from. He also announced two new degree programmes for this year, one in pharmaceutical science and the other in veterinary science. Students taking up the 5 1/2-year concurrent veterinary degree programme will graduate with an NUS degree in life sciences and a Doctor of Veterinary Medicine from the University of Melbourne. NUS, which now offers 230 bond-free merit scholarships, will add 200 more scholarships for the new academic year. Ms Geraldine Tan, 19, welcomed the move by NUS and said it is important for young people to get into a field that excites them. She said: "I really want to study business and maybe go on an overseas college stint as I want to start a social enterprise. Business courses are hard to get into, so I am hoping the bonus points will help me get the edge." Hwa Chong Institution student Hannah Ganesh, 18, said increasing double degree options is good as students can diversify their learning and "challenge themselves".http://www.straitstimes.com/singapor...choice-courses NUS' new offerings BONUS POINTS FOR FIRST CHOICE Students applying to NUS will be given 1.25 bonus points for their first-choice course. This applies only to courses where entry is based purely on students' grades. MORE DOUBLE MAJORS NUS will be increasing the number of double majors to open up more career options for its graduates. It currently offers 94 double major and major-minor combinations and will add another 86 such programmes. NEW DEGREES A new concurrent degree combines NUS' Bachelor of Science and the Doctor of Veterinary Medicine offered by the University of Melbourne. Students can complete the programmes in 5-1/2 years. NUS is also offering a new joint degree in pharmaceutical science with the University of Dundee in Scotland. The programme is designed to provide students with knowledge and skills for careers in the pharmaceutical, biomedical and consumer healthcare sectors. NUS OVERSEAS COLLEGES The programme that sends students on internships to several entrepreneurial hubs in the world will be extended to Jakarta and Toronto. MORE BOND-FREE SCHOLARSHIPS NUS, which now offers 230 bond-free merit scholarships, will add another 200 scholarships in the new academic year. ",12.609219438135662

Totally agree with you that scholarship should not be awarded based on academic performance only, which I did mention in my earlier post. The primary objective of my earlier post aims to encourage individuals who are currently applying/appealing for admission and/or scholarship - through the sharing of my education journey and the challenges experienced as an individual with a disadvantaged background. Subsequently, the post also seeks to highlight the flaws in the basis of selection for the scholarship interview. Today, institutions are still using a uniform assessment method to evaluate people of diverse backgrounds. The assessment for academic potential is pretty straightforward - cGPA, awards, and other academic achievement obtained from other sources (e.g. competitions, courses, etc.). The tricky part lies in the assessment of non-academic components - institutions seek individuals with certain attributes, qualities, and skills (e.g. leadership, teamwork, entrepreneurship, integrity, sports achievement, etc.). And often, institutions only consider school-related activities and/or co-curricular activities as the samples for their assessment.  On a personal note, I believed that those attributes, qualities, and skillscould also beidentified and assessed through employment experience (e.g. customers' testimonials, appraisals by superiors, awards attained, etc.).  In general, institutions should also look beyond the school-related activities and co-curricular activities when assessing the non-academic components of individuals. Hence, granting more flexibility for underprivileged students whose non-academic profile were considered as "insubstantial" and thereby allowing  them to have the opportunity to share their stories. Ultimately, an interview is all we need.P.s. I'm glad that your hard work paid off, and congrats on securing that scholarship offered by a private company  (I missed the application deadline for private & government scholarship ) To be shortlisted for interview on the government scholarship with 3.5GPA, you must have some really outstanding non-academic achievements! Do you mind to share with us? And hello senior , assuming you are an SMU student (based on the GPA capped at 4.0). As an individual with similar experience, juggling between full-time work and study is really no joke, not to mention that you are doing it at the University-level and still managed to scored a decent grade. Mind to share what full-time job you work as? Do you study in the day, and work at night/after-school hours? Did you, perhaps, packed all modules into that few days so that you could work for the rest of the days in the week?

Before your comments get lost in the sea of comments on this very active forum, let me reply to your rant/concerns. I just want to say that I get you. I totally do. Why? I was once in your position last year. Unknowingly fell into depression during the waiting period from April to May because I waited hopelessly for things that eventually (and obviously) did not come true... Exactly 1 year ago on this date (13 April 2017), I received a devastating offer from NTU — environmental engineering, and that was my last choice. It was supposed to be a celebration, that I received an offer, but it was the absolute last thing I wanted, since it wasn't my first choice, and something that I knew I couldn't accept doing (and was stupid enough to even place it in my choices, ah well).  Subsequently I got rejected by NUS and SMU, because I simply didn't make the cut... With a heavy heart I signed up (late) for private A levels, and as much as I hated the idea of having to retake, having to suffer... I had no choice. I really wanted to prove to myself that I CAN get into local uni. It didn't help when I'm from one of the top JCs, and my friends are moving on happily to overseas unis with unconditional offers, scholarships, or medicine, law, dentistry... you name it. I was utterly alone. And I felt like I was the only loser in my school (and also a disgrace to my school) who had to retake A levels, who couldn't really make the cut for local uni. In the end, ALL my appeals failed. What's new? Reality slapped me hard in the face, and it hurt like a bitch, of course. What could I do? I had to move on. I then spent some time correcting my mindset before I was actually more mentally stable for my exams. But I just have to tell you that you are really doing yourself a huge disfavour right now. Yes you are disappointed, you are not receiving news, everything seems oh so damn hopeless. But self pity will only kill you, as well as the people around you who love and care for you... do know that YOU are not the only one suffering, your family and friends are too! Everything seems bleak right now yes, but once you get that offer, everything will be merry and bright...  For me, I knew that I wanted to go to uni. I spent that one more year not just preparing for retake, but also redefining my goals and aspirations in my life. Also, building on my character. Depression no more! There were many sacrifices made, many times that I felt like hiding in a cave... but I overcame that and grew so much stronger. As long as you YEARN it, you will get it no matter what, because no one can stop you!! So don't even let the demons in your head stop you, please do not give in to depression.

I received my offer from NTU business...... It took one more year, but it was so worth it.

I heard from a senior in fass that 1 module in fass is about 1 lecture & 1 tutorial per week btw. The benefits of smu: 1. You get to interact and actively engage yourself during lessons. 2. More internship and exchange opportunities than nus. 3. Many students take double majors and more % taking double degree. 4. More specialisation tracks. 5. Higher employment and salary on average according to the employment survey. The downsides of smu: 1. Competition in smu is fierce. 2. Less campus life (in terms of hall etc) 3. The % of honours students there is lower than fass as it is harder to achieve honours in smu. 4. Less opportunities to make friends (Depends on your personality) The advantages of fass: 1. Lecture-tutorial style of learning, good for shy students who prefer mugging in a corner 2. Higher % of honours 3. Greater cohort size >> bell curve affects students less 3. You can take double majors too by DA or in the 2nd/3rd year 4. More campus life 5. Can stay in RC/hall etc. 6. For eg. econs is more academic and math inclined 7. World QS ranking The disadvantages of NUS: 1. Must find internships & exchange opportunities via the student (?) office. 2. Heavier and more modules esp for double major students (be prepared). I was offered double majors via DA, I counted 4 more modules for NUS than smu for the same double major combination. 3. More in depth and harder modules than smu (from my senior). 4. Hall/RC life may affect your academics. 5. Less specialisation tracks than smu.  Disclaimer ** What I think is subjective, I don’t mean to offend any NUS/SMU students reading this 😅 This is the summary of my ‘research’ haha xD. I am also deciding between nus and smu. Currently reading some year 1 stuff to see which one I like more I got SMU econs,  NUS FASS DMP and NBS offer tooWow your research is so detailed! Haha  Some things I would like to clarify for the benefit of everyone, which is based on my own knowledge and experience talking to friends across all 3 universities.  First and foremost, please take the employment surveys as a pinch of salt. Your salary won't be guaranteed to be higher just because you are enrolled in a particular university that is reported to have higher gross starting pay. Trust me,  when I was deciding on uni like you guys many years ago, I was affected by the graduate employment survey as well but then after years in uni and finally working,  I realised the survey might be misleading... Just so you know, most of these times when the graduates answer these surveys, the schools don't even check whether the pay you entered is true or not...How much you will get for your starting pay depends on your EXPERIENCE, your GRADES, your NEGOTIATION SKILLS, the ECONOMIC OUTLOOK at that POINT IN TIME,  the INDUSTRY and JOB SCOPE. Which uni honestly doesn't matter, cos all 3 local unis are considered on par to one another in the employers' eyes.  and it's just gross pay. There are other components in a salary package like bonuses and benefits which are not captured in the employment surveys. Some people may have a lower gross pay but may have higher bonuses and benefits (eg more days of leave) than someone with higher gross pay who may have less attractive bonuses and benefits. And many times, these surveys are not even representative of the whole student population as not all 100% of the graduating cohort would have completed the survey. Maybe it's just that small handful of students who did the survey and skewed the data?  regarding the point about students in nus being only able to source for internships from career office... That is not true at all. You can always self source (meaning you apply via websites like linkedin for eg by yourself) Oh and student exchange definitely must apply via student office regardless of whether is it nus ntu or smu... Cos all uni already have a list of overseas exchange partner universities that students can apply to then the student office will facilitate the process lor. The process is more or less the same across all 3 uni de.  And one more thing about nus I thought is worth mentioning, they have this NUS Overseas College (NOC) programme where you get to spend 1 year overseas studying and interning... You get to accumulate overseas work exp and clear modules like exchange as well. And the internships are paid. And there are many countries u can go to via this programme - Europe, Asia, USA. Do look it up. I kinda regretted not going 😭 cos it's such a valuable opportunity esp if u are passionate about entrepreneurship.Even if u are not its fine it's still great overseas exposure and it value adds to your resume! Oh and every school is competitive, not just SMU because regardless of which course or uni you go to, the bell curve is everywhere.  Choose your school based on the curriculum, the non academic opportunities available and the culture. Talk to seniors Or students who are studying in the universities and courses you have in mind to find out more. Talk to the recent students who have just graduated to find out more about the actual employment prospects and salary trends across the various unis and courses.  Hope this helps more people to come to a decision on which school to choose.",14.178989242136945

The professors themselves reiterate in the first lecture to tell us not to worry if you have no background because they will teach the basics to you. Agreed on the part for ICT1002 Programming Fundamental, Python is for beginners to learn as var in Python is loosely assign, don't have to care about memory allocation etc. Once student touch C will be another extreme. Memory allocation now is important, assigning var with wrong format and precision will cause C application to crash.

If you are totally new to programming, having ICT1001 supplement these knowledge such as SQL query statement. ICT1001 doesn't teach how to write stored procedure and other more advanced SQL statement such as left join, right join, union etc, while project if you know these trick, it can decrease the burden of writing inefficient codes. Also freeloader in ICT is another problem, playing taichi and act blur not contributing to project while others doing the project, they use the time to study for class test and exam.

Thanks whuttt wrote:  Good news for those borderline cases eyeing NUS " . . . . the plan to award up to 1.25 bonus points (equivalent of one H1 grade) to students applying for their first choice programme. The bonus points, applicable to programmes not requiring a pre-entry interview, will be added to the student’s University Admission Score. " http://news.nus.edu.sg/highlights/nu...on-initiatives NUS applicants to get bonus points for 1st-choice courses Passion for a field of study will count for admission to the National University of Singapore (NUS) from this year. Those applying for a place at NUS will be given 1.25 bonus points for their first choice - equivalent to going from C to B or B to A in an A-level H1 subject. This applies only to courses where entry is based purely on converting a student's grades into points, and not to courses such as medicine and law where students are assessed on their aptitude and interests through interviews. NUS senior deputy president and provost Ho Teck Hua, who announced the move at a press conference on Monday, said NUS analysis of admission data showed the bonus point can make a difference. "Let's say one student with 81 points applies for communications as his first choice, and another with 82 points applies to the same course as his second choice. With the 1.25 points, the student who lists the course as his first choice will get ahead of the person with 82 points," he said. On why NUS decided on the move, he said: "If you have done well and are passionate about a career in business or computing, for example, then we want to say to you that we support your passion." "We want to help you pursue your passion," he said, adding that students passionate about what they study tend to perform better. Professor Ho revealed that, currently, 65 per cent of students given a place in their first-choice course take up the offer, while only 45 per cent of those given their second-choice course do so. Noting NUS graduates' good job prospects, Prof Ho also announced that NUS will be increasing the number of double majors to increase career options for its graduates. "The nature of work is changing very rapidly, and we need to prepare students for a lifetime of diverse careers," he said. He said NUS, which currently offers 94 double major and major-minor combinations, will add another 86 such programmes. "Someone doing data science and entrepreneurship, for example, can go and work for a range of industries in data science, and also go and do a start-up." On top of the double majors, NUS also offers 71 double degrees, 33 joint degrees with partner universities and 24 concurrent degrees. Adding all this, currently 15 per cent of NUS students are trained in more than one discipline. Prof Ho said he hopes half of all NUS students will graduate with knowledge and skills in two different fields, so they will have more job offers to choose from. He also announced two new degree programmes for this year, one in pharmaceutical science and the other in veterinary science. Students taking up the 5 1/2-year concurrent veterinary degree programme will graduate with an NUS degree in life sciences and a Doctor of Veterinary Medicine from the University of Melbourne. NUS, which now offers 230 bond-free merit scholarships, will add 200 more scholarships for the new academic year. Ms Geraldine Tan, 19, welcomed the move by NUS and said it is important for young people to get into a field that excites them. She said: "I really want to study business and maybe go on an overseas college stint as I want to start a social enterprise. Business courses are hard to get into, so I am hoping the bonus points will help me get the edge." Hwa Chong Institution student Hannah Ganesh, 18, said increasing double degree options is good as students can diversify their learning and "challenge themselves".http://www.straitstimes.com/singapor...choice-courses NUS' new offerings BONUS POINTS FOR FIRST CHOICE Students applying to NUS will be given 1.25 bonus points for their first-choice course. This applies only to courses where entry is based purely on students' grades. MORE DOUBLE MAJORS NUS will be increasing the number of double majors to open up more career options for its graduates. It currently offers 94 double major and major-minor combinations and will add another 86 such programmes. NEW DEGREES A new concurrent degree combines NUS' Bachelor of Science and the Doctor of Veterinary Medicine offered by the University of Melbourne. Students can complete the programmes in 5-1/2 years. NUS is also offering a new joint degree in pharmaceutical science with the University of Dundee in Scotland. The programme is designed to provide students with knowledge and skills for careers in the pharmaceutical, biomedical and consumer healthcare sectors. NUS OVERSEAS COLLEGES The programme that sends students on internships to several entrepreneurial hubs in the world will be extended to Jakarta and Toronto.

Totally agree with you that scholarship should not be awarded based on academic performance only, which I did mention in my earlier post. The primary objective of my earlier post aims to encourage individuals who are currently applying/appealing for admission and/or scholarship - through the sharing of my education journey and the challenges experienced as an individual with a disadvantaged background. Subsequently, the post also seeks to highlight the flaws in the basis of selection for the scholarship interview. Today, institutions are still using a uniform assessment method to evaluate people of diverse backgrounds. The assessment for academic potential is pretty straightforward - cGPA, awards, and other academic achievement obtained from other sources (e.g. competitions, courses, etc.). The tricky part lies in the assessment of non-academic components - institutions seek individuals with certain attributes, qualities, and skills (e.g. leadership, teamwork, entrepreneurship, integrity, sports achievement, etc.). And often, institutions only consider school-related activities and/or co-curricular activities as the samples for their assessment.  On a personal note, I believed that those attributes, qualities, and skillscould also beidentified and assessed through employment experience (e.g. customers' testimonials, appraisals by superiors, awards attained, etc.).  In general, institutions should also look beyond the school-related activities and co-curricular activities when assessing the non-academic components of individuals. Hence, granting more flexibility for underprivileged students whose non-academic profile were considered as "insubstantial" and thereby allowing  them to have the opportunity to share their stories. Ultimately, an interview is all we need.P.s. I'm glad that your hard work paid off, and congrats on securing that scholarship offered by a private company  (I missed the application deadline for private & government scholarship ) To be shortlisted for interview on the government scholarship with 3.5GPA, you must have some really outstanding non-academic achievements! Do you mind to share with us? And hello senior , assuming you are an SMU student (based on the GPA capped at 4.0). As an individual with similar experience, juggling between full-time work and study is really no joke, not to mention that you are doing it at the University-level and still managed to scored a decent grade. Mind to share what full-time job you work as? Do you study in the day, and work at night/after-school hours? Did you, perhaps, packed all modules into that few days so that you could work for the rest of the days in the week? Sincerely hope that you can share some tips with us/me Networking/cloud computing consultant.

SMU rejected me or on waiting list now. Prepared so much in the topic but apparently not on the dress code or speaking enough like an ang moh. I was the only one that came in jeans and sneakers while everyone else were wearing formal. Is that overdress or what's to be expected? (I don't get why the email even said smart casual, but I just followed the email...) NTU and NUS completely ignoring me forever. I've gotten so depressed I'm no longer depressed. Perhaps this is one way of curing yourself of depression: where everything becomes a delusion and nothing in life matters anymore. It sucks that everything to form a judgment on someone can just be based on a single event on a single day and nothing else, but well, that's life. You can say there's still time but I just can't take waiting up to 3 agonizing more months later. If anything, the only realistic thing in life that will ever happen is me writing that appeal letter. Before your comments get lost in the sea of comments on this very active forum, let me reply to your rant/concerns. I just want to say that I get you. I totally do. Why? I was once in your position last year. Unknowingly fell into depression during the waiting period from April to May because I waited hopelessly for things that eventually (and obviously) did not come true... Exactly 1 year ago on this date (13 April 2017), I received a devastating offer from NTU — environmental engineering, and that was my last choice. It was supposed to be a celebration, that I received an offer, but it was the absolute last thing I wanted, since it wasn't my first choice, and something that I knew I couldn't accept doing (and was stupid enough to even place it in my choices, ah well).  Subsequently I got rejected by NUS and SMU, because I simply didn't make the cut... With a heavy heart I signed up (late) for private A levels, and as much as I hated the idea of having to retake, having to suffer... I had no choice. I really wanted to prove to myself that I CAN get into local uni. It didn't help when I'm from one of the top JCs, and my friends are moving on happily to overseas unis with unconditional offers, scholarships, or medicine, law, dentistry... you name it. I was utterly alone. And I felt like I was the only loser in my school (and also a disgrace to my school) who had to retake A levels, who couldn't really make the cut for local uni. In the end, ALL my appeals failed. What's new? Reality slapped me hard in the face, and it hurt like a bitch, of course. What could I do? I had to move on. I then spent some time correcting my mindset before I was actually more mentally stable for my exams. But I just have to tell you that you are really doing yourself a huge disfavour right now. Yes you are disappointed, you are not receiving news, everything seems oh so damn hopeless. But self pity will only kill you, as well as the people around you who love and care for you... do know that YOU are not the only one suffering, your family and friends are too! Everything seems bleak right now yes, but once you get that offer, everything will be merry and bright...  For me, I knew that I wanted to go to uni. I spent that one more year not just preparing for retake, but also redefining my goals and aspirations in my life. Also, building on my character. Depression no more! There were many sacrifices made, many times that I felt like hiding in a cave... but I overcame that and grew so much stronger. As long as you YEARN it, you will get it no matter what, because no one can stop you!! So don't even let the demons in your head stop you, please do not give in to depression. No one can help you except yourself. I suggest you try meditation and yoga, those things saved my ass (': And here I am back this year, legitly exactly one year later. I received my offer from NTU business...... It took one more year, but it was so worth it. Although my story might not be the most impressive one, but I've proved to everyone and most importantly myself that if I want something, I'm gonna make sure I get it, even if it means one year later. Because this is my future, and I am the captain of my ship of fate. I hope that you realise this too, be proud of who you are, of your battlescars, failures and experiences. All these will shape you into who you are — a better you. Chin up!! ",14.834825498793322

I heard from a senior in fass that 1 module in fass is about 1 lecture & 1 tutorial per week btw. The benefits of smu: 1. You get to interact and actively engage yourself during lessons. 2. More internship and exchange opportunities than nus. 3. Many students take double majors and more % taking double degree. 4. More specialisation tracks. 5. Higher employment and salary on average according to the employment survey. The downsides of smu: 1. Competition in smu is fierce. 2. Less campus life (in terms of hall etc) 3. The % of honours students there is lower than fass as it is harder to achieve honours in smu. 4. Less opportunities to make friends (Depends on your personality) The advantages of fass: 1. Lecture-tutorial style of learning, good for shy students who prefer mugging in a corner 2. Higher % of honours 3. Greater cohort size >> bell curve affects students less 3. You can take double majors too by DA or in the 2nd/3rd year 4. More campus life 5. Can stay in RC/hall etc. 6. For eg. econs is more academic and math inclined 7. World QS ranking The disadvantages of NUS: 1. Must find internships & exchange opportunities via the student (?) office. 2. Heavier and more modules esp for double major students (be prepared). I was offered double majors via DA, I counted 4 more modules for NUS than smu for the same double major combination. 3. More in depth and harder modules than smu (from my senior). 4. Hall/RC life may affect your academics. 5. Less specialisation tracks than smu.  Disclaimer ** What I think is subjective, I don’t mean to offend any NUS/SMU students reading this 😅 This is the summary of my ‘research’ haha xD. I am also deciding between nus and smu. Currently reading some year 1 stuff to see which one I like more I got SMU econs,  NUS FASS DMP and NBS offer tooWow your research is so detailed! Haha  Some things I would like to clarify for the benefit of everyone, which is based on my own knowledge and experience talking to friends across all 3 universities.  First and foremost, please take the employment surveys as a pinch of salt. Your salary won't be guaranteed to be higher just because you are enrolled in a particular university that is reported to have higher gross starting pay. Trust me,  when I was deciding on uni like you guys many years ago, I was affected by the graduate employment survey as well but then after years in uni and finally working,  I realised the survey might be misleading... Just so you know, most of these times when the graduates answer these surveys, the schools don't even check whether the pay you entered is true or not...How much you will get for your starting pay depends on your EXPERIENCE, your GRADES, your NEGOTIATION SKILLS, the ECONOMIC OUTLOOK at that POINT IN TIME,  the INDUSTRY and JOB SCOPE. Which uni honestly doesn't matter, cos all 3 local unis are considered on par to one another in the employers' eyes.  and it's just gross pay. There are other components in a salary package like bonuses and benefits which are not captured in the employment surveys. Some people may have a lower gross pay but may have higher bonuses and benefits (eg more days of leave) than someone with higher gross pay who may have less attractive bonuses and benefits. And many times, these surveys are not even representative of the whole student population as not all 100% of the graduating cohort would have completed the survey. Maybe it's just that small handful of students who did the survey and skewed the data?  regarding the point about students in nus being only able to source for internships from career office... That is not true at all. You can always self source (meaning you apply via websites like linkedin for eg by yourself) Oh and student exchange definitely must apply via student office regardless of whether is it nus ntu or smu... Cos all uni already have a list of overseas exchange partner universities that students can apply to then the student office will facilitate the process lor. The process is more or less the same across all 3 uni de.  And one more thing about nus I thought is worth mentioning, they have this NUS Overseas College (NOC) programme where you get to spend 1 year overseas studying and interning... You get to accumulate overseas work exp and clear modules like exchange as well. And the internships are paid. And there are many countries u can go to via this programme - Europe, Asia, USA. Do look it up. I kinda regretted not going 😭 cos it's such a valuable opportunity esp if u are passionate about entrepreneurship.Even if u are not its fine it's still great overseas exposure and it value adds to your resume! Oh and every school is competitive, not just SMU because regardless of which course or uni you go to, the bell curve is everywhere.  Choose your school based on the curriculum, the non academic opportunities available and the culture. Talk to seniors Or students who are studying in the universities and courses you have in mind to find out more. Talk to the recent students who have just graduated to find out more about the actual employment prospects and salary trends across the various unis and courses.  Hope this helps more people to come to a decision on which school to choose.",14.178989242136945

Edit: One thing that I need to mention is the program is in NO WAY designed that you NEED to know how to code before coming.

The ramp up is fast I admit, but thats the nature of computer science ask anyone in nus/ntu comp sci or smu is, they will tell you the same thing.

I challenge anyone who has seen that to tell me that its not meant for someone with 0 background in coding. The professors themselves reiterate in the first lecture to tell us not to worry if you have no background because they will teach the basics to you. Agreed on the part for ICT1002 Programming Fundamental, Python is for beginners to learn as var in Python is loosely assign, don't have to care about memory allocation etc. Once student touch C will be another extreme. Memory allocation now is important, assigning var with wrong format and precision will cause C application to crash. For ICT1004, given 4 weeks to create a scheduling system in PHP, SQL, CSS3,HTML5 following the semantic requirements, JavaScript/jQuery. If you are unlucky that 2 of out of 4 teammates not contribute much, you will having the feeling of a sinking boat. Just a project in ICT1004 implement all this different language.  If you are totally new to programming, having ICT1001 supplement these knowledge such as SQL query statement. ICT1001 doesn't teach how to write stored procedure and other more advanced SQL statement such as left join, right join, union etc, while project if you know these trick, it can decrease the burden of writing inefficient codes. Also freeloader in ICT is another problem, playing taichi and act blur not contributing to project while others doing the project, they use the time to study for class test and exam. Also known as "being carried". During exam for the first trimester, some wrote C code in PHP question, PHP code in Python question, Python code in JavaScript.

Thanks whuttt wrote:  Good news for those borderline cases eyeing NUS " . . . . the plan to award up to 1.25 bonus points (equivalent of one H1 grade) to students applying for their first choice programme. The bonus points, applicable to programmes not requiring a pre-entry interview, will be added to the student’s University Admission Score. " http://news.nus.edu.sg/highlights/nu...on-initiatives NUS applicants to get bonus points for 1st-choice courses Passion for a field of study will count for admission to the National University of Singapore (NUS) from this year. Those applying for a place at NUS will be given 1.25 bonus points for their first choice - equivalent to going from C to B or B to A in an A-level H1 subject. This applies only to courses where entry is based purely on converting a student's grades into points, and not to courses such as medicine and law where students are assessed on their aptitude and interests through interviews. NUS senior deputy president and provost Ho Teck Hua, who announced the move at a press conference on Monday, said NUS analysis of admission data showed the bonus point can make a difference. "Let's say one student with 81 points applies for communications as his first choice, and another with 82 points applies to the same course as his second choice. With the 1.25 points, the student who lists the course as his first choice will get ahead of the person with 82 points," he said. On why NUS decided on the move, he said: "If you have done well and are passionate about a career in business or computing, for example, then we want to say to you that we support your passion." "We want to help you pursue your passion," he said, adding that students passionate about what they study tend to perform better. Professor Ho revealed that, currently, 65 per cent of students given a place in their first-choice course take up the offer, while only 45 per cent of those given their second-choice course do so. Noting NUS graduates' good job prospects, Prof Ho also announced that NUS will be increasing the number of double majors to increase career options for its graduates. "The nature of work is changing very rapidly, and we need to prepare students for a lifetime of diverse careers," he said. He said NUS, which currently offers 94 double major and major-minor combinations, will add another 86 such programmes. "Someone doing data science and entrepreneurship, for example, can go and work for a range of industries in data science, and also go and do a start-up." On top of the double majors, NUS also offers 71 double degrees, 33 joint degrees with partner universities and 24 concurrent degrees. Adding all this, currently 15 per cent of NUS students are trained in more than one discipline. Prof Ho said he hopes half of all NUS students will graduate with knowledge and skills in two different fields, so they will have more job offers to choose from. He also announced two new degree programmes for this year, one in pharmaceutical science and the other in veterinary science. Students taking up the 5 1/2-year concurrent veterinary degree programme will graduate with an NUS degree in life sciences and a Doctor of Veterinary Medicine from the University of Melbourne. NUS, which now offers 230 bond-free merit scholarships, will add 200 more scholarships for the new academic year. Ms Geraldine Tan, 19, welcomed the move by NUS and said it is important for young people to get into a field that excites them. She said: "I really want to study business and maybe go on an overseas college stint as I want to start a social enterprise. Business courses are hard to get into, so I am hoping the bonus points will help me get the edge." Hwa Chong Institution student Hannah Ganesh, 18, said increasing double degree options is good as students can diversify their learning and "challenge themselves".http://www.straitstimes.com/singapor...choice-courses NUS' new offerings BONUS POINTS FOR FIRST CHOICE Students applying to NUS will be given 1.25 bonus points for their first-choice course. This applies only to courses where entry is based purely on students' grades. MORE DOUBLE MAJORS NUS will be increasing the number of double majors to open up more career options for its graduates. It currently offers 94 double major and major-minor combinations and will add another 86 such programmes. NEW DEGREES A new concurrent degree combines NUS' Bachelor of Science and the Doctor of Veterinary Medicine offered by the University of Melbourne. Students can complete the programmes in 5-1/2 years. NUS is also offering a new joint degree in pharmaceutical science with the University of Dundee in Scotland. The programme is designed to provide students with knowledge and skills for careers in the pharmaceutical, biomedical and consumer healthcare sectors. NUS OVERSEAS COLLEGES The programme that sends students on internships to several entrepreneurial hubs in the world will be extended to Jakarta and Toronto. MORE BOND-FREE SCHOLARSHIPS NUS, which now offers 230 bond-free merit scholarships, will add another 200 scholarships in the new academic year. ",12.61357862747964

Totally agree with you that scholarship should not be awarded based on academic performance only, which I did mention in my earlier post. The primary objective of my earlier post aims to encourage individuals who are currently applying/appealing for admission and/or scholarship - through the sharing of my education journey and the challenges experienced as an individual with a disadvantaged background. Subsequently, the post also seeks to highlight the flaws in the basis of selection for the scholarship interview. Today, institutions are still using a uniform assessment method to evaluate people of diverse backgrounds. The assessment for academic potential is pretty straightforward - cGPA, awards, and other academic achievement obtained from other sources (e.g. competitions, courses, etc.). The tricky part lies in the assessment of non-academic components - institutions seek individuals with certain attributes, qualities, and skills (e.g. leadership, teamwork, entrepreneurship, integrity, sports achievement, etc.). And often, institutions only consider school-related activities and/or co-curricular activities as the samples for their assessment.  On a personal note, I believed that those attributes, qualities, and skillscould also beidentified and assessed through employment experience (e.g. customers' testimonials, appraisals by superiors, awards attained, etc.).  In general, institutions should also look beyond the school-related activities and co-curricular activities when assessing the non-academic components of individuals. Hence, granting more flexibility for underprivileged students whose non-academic profile were considered as "insubstantial" and thereby allowing  them to have the opportunity to share their stories. Ultimately, an interview is all we need.P.s. I'm glad that your hard work paid off, and congrats on securing that scholarship offered by a private company  (I missed the application deadline for private & government scholarship ) To be shortlisted for interview on the government scholarship with 3.5GPA, you must have some really outstanding non-academic achievements! Do you mind to share with us? And hello senior , assuming you are an SMU student (based on the GPA capped at 4.0). As an individual with similar experience, juggling between full-time work and study is really no joke, not to mention that you are doing it at the University-level and still managed to scored a decent grade. Mind to share what full-time job you work as? Do you study in the day, and work at night/after-school hours? Did you, perhaps, packed all modules into that few days so that you could work for the rest of the days in the week? Sincerely hope that you can share some tips with us/me Networking/cloud computing consultant.

Therefore, my non-academic profile was considered to be "insubstantial" in comparison with other individuals who had the resources to be a full-time student. Whilst there is nothing wrong with awarding scholarships primarily on academic achievement, the current selection criteria and system may be further skewed against lower-income households, as their children may have less in the areas of co-curricular activities, leadership track record, etc, because of their limited financial resources. This may further stack the odds against the lower-income, who have fewer resources to access tuition, enrichment programmes, learning aids, etc. The irony of how institutions used a uniform assessment method to evaluate people of diverse backgrounds - the subtle ways colleges discriminate against poor students  Ultimately, life is fair because the world is unfair to everyone  Heng (lucky) still can apply for financial aid  Woah!

Whilst there is nothing wrong with awarding scholarships primarily on academic achievement, the current selection criteria and system may be further skewed against lower-income households, as their children may have less in the areas of co-curricular activities, leadership track record, etc, because of their limited financial resources. This may further stack the odds against the lower-income, who have fewer resources to access tuition, enrichment programmes, learning aids, etc. The irony of how institutions used a uniform assessment method to evaluate people of diverse backgrounds - the subtle ways colleges discriminate against poor students  Ultimately, life is fair because the world is unfair to everyone  Heng (lucky) still can apply for financial aid Little Angry Potato wrote:  3.97.

I think the whole “3 vs 4 years” debate comes up every intake, and it’s easy to think linearly and say that NBS > SMU Biz/Acc. However, would like to point out that: 1) Depending on the number of exemptions, one may be able to complete the program in 3 or 3.5 years, rather than four. 2) SMU’s curriculum is more holistic in that you don’t just take courses specific to your domain, but are able to take a second major to learn a complementary discipline (ie Accounting w/ second major in Finance or Finance w/ a second major in Economics, and there are so many other combinations as well). The core modules also address topics that are quite pertinent to self-improvement, which I think is beneficial.  3) SMU is a management school, and so you get a number of inherent advantages from studying Biz/Acc here. The emphasis on corporate skills, the professors, the school culture, and the proximity to the CBD all contribute to making students more effective management professionals.  4) SMU may not be known for the hostel experience, but the vibrancy of the CCAs more than makes up for it.  Ultimately, I believe the choice has to made by oneself. But I do think the preceding points could definitely aid in one’s research to see what best fits him or her.

You can graduate faster in 3 years and start working earlier, but 4 years lets you do more internships and take more modules. Up to individual preference. 2) The nbs second major is severely limited. It is almost impossible to do a non-traditional second major because you only have 3 years to graduate and very few units for electives. 3) Contrary to popular belief, nbs is not well-known outside Singapore at all , although the ntu brand does have some mileage in asia. 4) CCA is a moot point becauase all unis have CCAs. However, it is true that hall life may be an important consideration for some applicants. And lastly, SMU has way better career services because: - They are located in the city, it is easy to get companies to come down or to get students to attend talks - Because they are located in the city, it is also easy for their students to do part-time internships - They have a much stronger alumni network - Their career service office is much more pro-active than nbs The nbs career office always jokes about how smu students are only good at talking/presentation. But just look at linkedin for the career outcomes of NBS students compared to SMU students. The NBS guy will probably end up in Big4 while the SMU guy is in a bank.

This is my personal opinion but I think poly kids are able to cope better if they go to smu rather than NUS or NTU.   You will definitely get a shock when you enter ntu. You would have to put in effort from week 1 if you want to maintain your gpa. In my first sem, majority of my classmates are from mid tier to top jcs (anderson, hwachong, raffles, acjc and etc). Their rank points are about 85 to 90. As such it is VERY VERY difficult to compete with them. Not sure about SMU. FrostWurm wrote:  Graduated from NBS several years ago. The culture is very cheena, so if you are not cheena, I strongly suggest NUS or SMU if not you will be like a fish out of water. In terms of career services, SMU is ahead. They usually get better placements, and students can do internships during the term due to the proximity of the school to CBD. They are way ahead of NUS and NTU in placing their students into good jobs. But school fees more expensive, and SMU doesn't have hall life (if you want to experience it). Also seems that the competition there is extremely fierce (class participation anyone?). But its in the city which also has some perks. Probably NTU if you just wanna grad quickly and be an auditor (although many also end up in management associate roles). SMU may be better if you are aiming for front office finance positions. actually for poly grads going uni & intend to go big4, better to go SIT. can become Associate 2 upon graduation and it is 2-3 years course. but if want big 3 then NTU because 3 years course.

Please share your views on it as well. I really hope to get into NUS IS (I am interested in the modules offered) but no news till now so I am already prepared to face the worst scenario. I did receive an offer from SMU so I still got Plan B.  However, SMU school fees is higher than NUS by over 10k, which really makes me think whether should I take up SMU offer.  Personally, I like both SMU and NUS but school fees is really a factor that I must take into account of. Moreover, I do not have an extensive knowledge on how SMU IS curriculum. I wonder is it the same as NUS? or does it differ a lot?  So if NUS rejects me this year, I intend to reject SMU offer, and apply next year to NUS. The reason being university will no longer take into account of O Level result from Y2020 onwards. I was a PFP student and does not have an O Level result thus the long wait or possible rejection from NUS. So I would like to ask what are some of your thoughts on this?  1) Should I reject SMU this year and apply for NUS next year?  2) Do I stand a higher chance in getting accepted if I apply next year? (My CGPA is above 3.9)  Thank you everyone for reading this long post lol just wanna listen to some of your advices/opinions. Thanks! Hi! I'm in similar situation. I graduated in 2017, coming from relevant Diploma with Merit CGPA 3.95.  I'm a PFP student as well but I do not meet the maths requirement. Thus, I've been trying DA as I have good CCA records (I won several awards in local IT competitions, represented SG in international competition before, worked as freelance developer as well as startup biz as well). I got invited for DA in 2017, but didn't manage to secure a spot. Applied last year & was rejected without interview and this year is my last year of applying as I managed to disrupt from National Service (I enlisted late). I currently accepted NTU Computer Science. I'm thinking whether to take a gap year to take O Level Maths to increase my chance as well as from Y2020 onwards, O level will not be taken into consideration. However, due to my family circumstances as well as discouragement from friends I most likely will be enrolling into NTU meanwhile just praying for some good news from NUS side. Haha. Are you a male or female?  If you are a male serving NS, You can accept SMU offer first and reapply next year.  I wish you all the best and hope you will get news from NUS soon!",11.261580337113891

But NTU have replied to offer an interview as well (same course). I am not sure if I should attend for the interview as I really like SMU but the tuition fee is really a huge burden. Overall I am wondering which school is better to attend? What are the pros and cons for both schools? I'm not sure about NTU, but I can share some from my perspective as an SMU Accountancy student.Similarities1. Content: NTU and SMU accounting modules are similar according to my NTU Accountancy friends.  More or less the same, but the depth may vary according to the electives taken. 2. Seminar style: SMU has it for all classes. NTU has it, but I'm not sure.3. Exemptions: - For professional qualifications, for SMU, you can get 12 out of 15 exemptions (provided you pass the requisite papers) for ICAEW. - For NTU, I'm not sure, but I've a friend who took advanced tax and (i heard) is exempted from CA Singapore's Tax paper. (Need to confirm.)Differences1. Cost SMU = $11k per annum for 4 years = $44k NTU = $8k per annum for 3 years = $24k Yup the cost difference is quite large (assuming we don't factor in hostel fees).2. Exemptions - This is more applicable if you're a poly student. If your poly's CGPA is >= 3.8, you can get a maximum of 10+ exemptions from SMU. This means you can graduate in 3 years from SMU even without overloading modules. 3. Location - SMU is more accessible, unless you stay in the west then NTU is more accessible.4. Ability to SU modules! - SMU: Has the option to SU two elective modules only when you file for graduation.  - NTU: Can SU some electives according to their website. 5. Graduate starting pay Already mentioned by SiaoLengKeng earlier in this thread, the starting pay for big 4 for both NTU and SMU graduates are similar. $3,000+ for audit.6. Other misc requirements - SMU has a compulsory 80 hours community service requirement + 1x overseas trip requirement. Overall, if we compare just by cost alone, NTU would be better because it is more cost efficient, but if we consider other factors, then there's no uni that's "better".

Please share your views on it as well. I really hope to get into NUS IS (I am interested in the modules offered) but no news till now so I am already prepared to face the worst scenario. I did receive an offer from SMU so I still got Plan B.  However, SMU school fees is higher than NUS by over 10k, which really makes me think whether should I take up SMU offer.  Personally, I like both SMU and NUS but school fees is really a factor that I must take into account of. Moreover, I do not have an extensive knowledge on how SMU IS curriculum. I wonder is it the same as NUS? or does it differ a lot?  So if NUS rejects me this year, I intend to reject SMU offer, and apply next year to NUS. The reason being university will no longer take into account of O Level result from Y2020 onwards. I was a PFP student and does not have an O Level result thus the long wait or possible rejection from NUS. So I would like to ask what are some of your thoughts on this?  1) Should I reject SMU this year and apply for NUS next year?  2) Do I stand a higher chance in getting accepted if I apply next year? (My CGPA is above 3.9)  Thank you everyone for reading this long post lol just wanna listen to some of your advices/opinions. Thanks! Hi! I'm in similar situation. I graduated in 2017, coming from relevant Diploma with Merit CGPA 3.95.  I'm a PFP student as well but I do not meet the maths requirement. Thus, I've been trying DA as I have good CCA records (I won several awards in local IT competitions, represented SG in international competition before, worked as freelance developer as well as startup biz as well). I got invited for DA in 2017, but didn't manage to secure a spot. Applied last year & was rejected without interview and this year is my last year of applying as I managed to disrupt from National Service (I enlisted late). I currently accepted NTU Computer Science. I'm thinking whether to take a gap year to take O Level Maths to increase my chance as well as from Y2020 onwards, O level will not be taken into consideration. However, due to my family circumstances as well as discouragement from friends I most likely will be enrolling into NTU meanwhile just praying for some good news from NUS side. Haha. Are you a male or female?  If you are a male serving NS, You can accept SMU offer first and reapply next year.  I wish you all the best and hope you will get news from NUS soon!",11.289762003755888

But NTU have replied to offer an interview as well (same course). I am not sure if I should attend for the interview as I really like SMU but the tuition fee is really a huge burden. Overall I am wondering which school is better to attend? What are the pros and cons for both schools? I'm not sure about NTU, but I can share some from my perspective as an SMU Accountancy student.Similarities1. Content: NTU and SMU accounting modules are similar according to my NTU Accountancy friends.  More or less the same, but the depth may vary according to the electives taken. 2. Seminar style: SMU has it for all classes. NTU has it, but I'm not sure.3. Exemptions: - For professional qualifications, for SMU, you can get 12 out of 15 exemptions (provided you pass the requisite papers) for ICAEW. - For NTU, I'm not sure, but I've a friend who took advanced tax and (i heard) is exempted from CA Singapore's Tax paper. (Need to confirm.)Differences1. Cost SMU = $11k per annum for 4 years = $44k NTU = $8k per annum for 3 years = $24k Yup the cost difference is quite large (assuming we don't factor in hostel fees).2. Exemptions - This is more applicable if you're a poly student. If your poly's CGPA is >= 3.8, you can get a maximum of 10+ exemptions from SMU. This means you can graduate in 3 years from SMU even without overloading modules. 3. Location - SMU is more accessible, unless you stay in the west then NTU is more accessible.4. Ability to SU modules! - SMU: Has the option to SU two elective modules only when you file for graduation.  - NTU: Can SU some electives according to their website. 5. Graduate starting pay Already mentioned by SiaoLengKeng earlier in this thread, the starting pay for big 4 for both NTU and SMU graduates are similar. $3,000+ for audit.6. Other misc requirements - SMU has a compulsory 80 hours community service requirement + 1x overseas trip requirement. Overall, if we compare just by cost alone, NTU would be better because it is more cost efficient, but if we consider other factors, then there's no uni that's "better". It'll depend on your personal preference!",10.431898034716511

But NTU have replied to offer an interview as well (same course). I am not sure if I should attend for the interview as I really like SMU but the tuition fee is really a huge burden. Overall I am wondering which school is better to attend? What are the pros and cons for both schools? I'm not sure about NTU, but I can share some from my perspective as an SMU Accountancy student.Similarities1. Content: NTU and SMU accounting modules are similar according to my NTU Accountancy friends.  More or less the same, but the depth may vary according to the electives taken. 2. Seminar style: SMU has it for all classes. NTU has it, but I'm not sure.3. Exemptions: - For professional qualifications, for SMU, you can get 12 out of 15 exemptions (provided you pass the requisite papers) for ICAEW. - For NTU, I'm not sure, but I've a friend who took advanced tax and (i heard) is exempted from CA Singapore's Tax paper. (Need to confirm.)Differences1. Cost SMU = $11k per annum for 4 years = $44k NTU = $8k per annum for 3 years = $24k Yup the cost difference is quite large (assuming we don't factor in hostel fees).2. Exemptions - This is more applicable if you're a poly student. If your poly's CGPA is >= 3.8, you can get a maximum of 10+ exemptions from SMU. This means you can graduate in 3 years from SMU even without overloading modules. 3. Location - SMU is more accessible, unless you stay in the west then NTU is more accessible.4. Ability to SU modules! - SMU: Has the option to SU two elective modules only when you file for graduation.  - NTU: Can SU some electives according to their website. 5. Graduate starting pay Already mentioned by SiaoLengKeng earlier in this thread, the starting pay for big 4 for both NTU and SMU graduates are similar. $3,000+ for audit.6. Other misc requirements - SMU has a compulsory 80 hours community service requirement + 1x overseas trip requirement. Overall, if we compare just by cost alone, NTU would be better because it is more cost efficient, but if we consider other factors, then there's no uni that's "better". It'll depend on your personal preference!",10.432125576080068

I think the whole “3 vs 4 years” debate comes up every intake, and it’s easy to think linearly and say that NBS > SMU Biz/Acc. However, would like to point out that: 1) Depending on the number of exemptions, one may be able to complete the program in 3 or 3.5 years, rather than four. 2) SMU’s curriculum is more holistic in that you don’t just take courses specific to your domain, but are able to take a second major to learn a complementary discipline (ie Accounting w/ second major in Finance or Finance w/ a second major in Economics, and there are so many other combinations as well). The core modules also address topics that are quite pertinent to self-improvement, which I think is beneficial.  3) SMU is a management school, and so you get a number of inherent advantages from studying Biz/Acc here. The emphasis on corporate skills, the professors, the school culture, and the proximity to the CBD all contribute to making students more effective management professionals.  4) SMU may not be known for the hostel experience, but the vibrancy of the CCAs more than makes up for it.  Ultimately, I believe the choice has to made by oneself. But I do think the preceding points could definitely aid in one’s research to see what best fits him or her.

I grew fondly for social science (i.e. psychology) even though I am a poly student who studies accountancy and have a mixture of accounting and business knowledge. 2. I feel that I want to study with a deeper meaning and that it would benefit both society and myself. (I love to make people smile and be happy, thinking on the positive side) 3. I would not only just basically want to study on psychology, I want to expand my knowledge such as taking extra courses that would broaden my career prospects. The above facts are there to briefly describe what are my thoughts now because I do not want to regret choosing the wrong course in the end but still I'm planning to enter a local uni as of now. I would really appreciate any feedbacks or suggestions from any point of view.  Thanks guys!    Hi, im currently a y1 psych student in NTU! I believe NTU/NUS would be a better choice given your goals and aims in life! In ntu, besides taking the psych core mods, many NTU psych majors also take up NIE mods as their minors (such as in counselling, special needs, early childhood, youth pathopsychology, educational psychology and the list goes on HAHA) In nus, i believe there are social work modules that you can take either as a second major, minor or free electives (which seems to suit your passion of helping others!) I feel that SMU is more geared towards business and may not necessarily suits your future career aspirations (not because it's not as good but it doesn't seem in line with your goals) Also, maybe you can take into consideration the environment you work best in and maybe travelling time (because tbh, there shouldn't be that much diff between the 3 uni in terms of prestige- psychology in the 3 uni aren't ranked very highly in the world actually- most of my coursemates would love to enrol in overseas uni if they got the $$$)  also, I am not in the position to speak for poly students since Im from the JC route (so im not very sure ^^"; all I know is that NUS FASS cop is BBC/B and NTU psych cop is AAC/C to apply; I didnt apply to SMU psych- however, i heard it's based more on interviews rather than just your rp like for NTU/NUS? Im not very sure) Actually, you may also consider that NTU psych is a direct honours track, and direct honours is basically what it is; however, if you are not planning to take masters (in which having honours makes it easier to), you should save your money and just go NUS FASS (3 years if you cant/dont want to get honours) Hope this helps!

This is my personal opinion but I think poly kids are able to cope better if they go to smu rather than NUS or NTU.   You will definitely get a shock when you enter ntu. You would have to put in effort from week 1 if you want to maintain your gpa. In my first sem, majority of my classmates are from mid tier to top jcs (anderson, hwachong, raffles, acjc and etc). Their rank points are about 85 to 90. As such it is VERY VERY difficult to compete with them. Not sure about SMU. FrostWurm wrote:  Graduated from NBS several years ago. The culture is very cheena, so if you are not cheena, I strongly suggest NUS or SMU if not you will be like a fish out of water. In terms of career services, SMU is ahead. They usually get better placements, and students can do internships during the term due to the proximity of the school to CBD. They are way ahead of NUS and NTU in placing their students into good jobs. But school fees more expensive, and SMU doesn't have hall life (if you want to experience it). Also seems that the competition there is extremely fierce (class participation anyone?). But its in the city which also has some perks. Probably NTU if you just wanna grad quickly and be an auditor (although many also end up in management associate roles). SMU may be better if you are aiming for front office finance positions. actually for poly grads going uni & intend to go big4, better to go SIT. can become Associate 2 upon graduation and it is 2-3 years course. but if want big 3 then NTU because 3 years course.

You can graduate faster in 3 years and start working earlier, but 4 years lets you do more internships and take more modules. Up to individual preference. 2) The nbs second major is severely limited. It is almost impossible to do a non-traditional second major because you only have 3 years to graduate and very few units for electives. 3) Contrary to popular belief, nbs is not well-known outside Singapore at all , although the ntu brand does have some mileage in asia. 4) CCA is a moot point becauase all unis have CCAs. However, it is true that hall life may be an important consideration for some applicants. And lastly, SMU has way better career services because: - They are located in the city, it is easy to get companies to come down or to get students to attend talks - Because they are located in the city, it is also easy for their students to do part-time internships - They have a much stronger alumni network - Their career service office is much more pro-active than nbs The nbs career office always jokes about how smu students are only good at talking/presentation.

I believe NTU/NUS would be a better choice given your goals and aims in life! In ntu, besides taking the psych core mods, many NTU psych majors also take up NIE mods as their minors (such as in counselling, special needs, early childhood, youth pathopsychology, educational psychology and the list goes on HAHA) In nus, i believe there are social work modules that you can take either as a second major, minor or free electives (which seems to suit your passion of helping others!) I feel that SMU is more geared towards business and may not necessarily suits your future career aspirations (not because it's not as good but it doesn't seem in line with your goals) Also, maybe you can take into consideration the environment you work best in and maybe travelling time (because tbh, there shouldn't be that much diff between the 3 uni in terms of prestige- psychology in the 3 uni aren't ranked very highly in the world actually- most of my coursemates would love to enrol in overseas uni if they got the $$$)  also, I am not in the position to speak for poly students since Im from the JC route (so im not very sure ^^"; all I know is that NUS FASS cop is BBC/B and NTU psych cop is AAC/C to apply; I didnt apply to SMU psych- however, i heard it's based more on interviews rather than just your rp like for NTU/NUS? Im not very sure) Actually, you may also consider that NTU psych is a direct honours track, and direct honours is basically what it is; however, if you are not planning to take masters (in which having honours makes it easier to), you should save your money and just go NUS FASS (3 years if you cant/dont want to get honours) Hope this helps!

If you're heading to big 4 after grad, heard the starting pay is more or less the same. If so, why go for a 4 year's course?  Ntu offers plenty of exchange opportunities too.  This is my personal opinion but I think poly kids are able to cope better if they go to smu rather than NUS or NTU.   You will definitely get a shock when you enter ntu. You would have to put in effort from week 1 if you want to maintain your gpa. In my first sem, majority of my classmates are from mid tier to top jcs (anderson, hwachong, raffles, acjc and etc). Their rank points are about 85 to 90. As such it is VERY VERY difficult to compete with them. Not sure about SMU. FrostWurm wrote:  Graduated from NBS several years ago. The culture is very cheena, so if you are not cheena, I strongly suggest NUS or SMU if not you will be like a fish out of water. In terms of career services, SMU is ahead. They usually get better placements, and students can do internships during the term due to the proximity of the school to CBD. They are way ahead of NUS and NTU in placing their students into good jobs. But school fees more expensive, and SMU doesn't have hall life (if you want to experience it). Also seems that the competition there is extremely fierce (class participation anyone?). But its in the city which also has some perks. Probably NTU if you just wanna grad quickly and be an auditor (although many also end up in management associate roles). SMU may be better if you are aiming for front office finance positions. actually for poly grads going uni & intend to go big4, better to go SIT. can become Associate 2 upon graduation and it is 2-3 years course. but if want big 3 then NTU because 3 years course.

I think the whole “3 vs 4 years” debate comes up every intake, and it’s easy to think linearly and say that NBS > SMU Biz/Acc. However, would like to point out that: 1) Depending on the number of exemptions, one may be able to complete the program in 3 or 3.5 years, rather than four. 2) SMU’s curriculum is more holistic in that you don’t just take courses specific to your domain, but are able to take a second major to learn a complementary discipline (ie Accounting w/ second major in Finance or Finance w/ a second major in Economics, and there are so many other combinations as well). The core modules also address topics that are quite pertinent to self-improvement, which I think is beneficial.  3) SMU is a management school, and so you get a number of inherent advantages from studying Biz/Acc here. The emphasis on corporate skills, the professors, the school culture, and the proximity to the CBD all contribute to making students more effective management professionals.  4) SMU may not be known for the hostel experience, but the vibrancy of the CCAs more than makes up for it.  Ultimately, I believe the choice has to made by oneself. But I do think the preceding points could definitely aid in one’s research to see what best fits him or her.

You can graduate faster in 3 years and start working earlier, but 4 years lets you do more internships and take more modules. Up to individual preference. 2) The nbs second major is severely limited. It is almost impossible to do a non-traditional second major because you only have 3 years to graduate and very few units for electives. 3) Contrary to popular belief, nbs is not well-known outside Singapore at all , although the ntu brand does have some mileage in asia. 4) CCA is a moot point becauase all unis have CCAs. However, it is true that hall life may be an important consideration for some applicants. And lastly, SMU has way better career services because: - They are located in the city, it is easy to get companies to come down or to get students to attend talks - Because they are located in the city, it is also easy for their students to do part-time internships - They have a much stronger alumni network - Their career service office is much more pro-active than nbs The nbs career office always jokes about how smu students are only good at talking/presentation. But just look at linkedin for the career outcomes of NBS students compared to SMU students. The NBS guy will probably end up in Big4 while the SMU guy is in a bank. For the record, nbs graduate here. rabbit1 wrote:  Sorry but reasons like "career office located in city" is superior or SMU has a stronger alumni network without substantiation sounds stupid and don't hold too much water.

Please share your views on it as well. I really hope to get into NUS IS (I am interested in the modules offered) but no news till now so I am already prepared to face the worst scenario. I did receive an offer from SMU so I still got Plan B.  However, SMU school fees is higher than NUS by over 10k, which really makes me think whether should I take up SMU offer.  Personally, I like both SMU and NUS but school fees is really a factor that I must take into account of. Moreover, I do not have an extensive knowledge on how SMU IS curriculum. I wonder is it the same as NUS? or does it differ a lot?  So if NUS rejects me this year, I intend to reject SMU offer, and apply next year to NUS. The reason being university will no longer take into account of O Level result from Y2020 onwards. I was a PFP student and does not have an O Level result thus the long wait or possible rejection from NUS. So I would like to ask what are some of your thoughts on this?  1) Should I reject SMU this year and apply for NUS next year?  2) Do I stand a higher chance in getting accepted if I apply next year? (My CGPA is above 3.9)  Thank you everyone for reading this long post lol just wanna listen to some of your advices/opinions. Thanks! Hi! I'm in similar situation. I graduated in 2017, coming from relevant Diploma with Merit CGPA 3.95.  I'm a PFP student as well but I do not meet the maths requirement. Thus, I've been trying DA as I have good CCA records (I won several awards in local IT competitions, represented SG in international competition before, worked as freelance developer as well as startup biz as well). I got invited for DA in 2017, but didn't manage to secure a spot. Applied last year & was rejected without interview and this year is my last year of applying as I managed to disrupt from National Service (I enlisted late). I currently accepted NTU Computer Science. I'm thinking whether to take a gap year to take O Level Maths to increase my chance as well as from Y2020 onwards, O level will not be taken into consideration. However, due to my family circumstances as well as discouragement from friends I most likely will be enrolling into NTU meanwhile just praying for some good news from NUS side. Haha. Are you a male or female?  If you are a male serving NS, You can accept SMU offer first and reapply next year.  I wish you all the best and hope you will get news from NUS soon!",11.24952349710144

You can graduate faster in 3 years and start working earlier, but 4 years lets you do more internships and take more modules. Up to individual preference. 2) The nbs second major is severely limited. It is almost impossible to do a non-traditional second major because you only have 3 years to graduate and very few units for electives. 3) Contrary to popular belief, nbs is not well-known outside Singapore at all , although the ntu brand does have some mileage in asia. 4) CCA is a moot point becauase all unis have CCAs. However, it is true that hall life may be an important consideration for some applicants. And lastly, SMU has way better career services because: - They are located in the city, it is easy to get companies to come down or to get students to attend talks - Because they are located in the city, it is also easy for their students to do part-time internships - They have a much stronger alumni network - Their career service office is much more pro-active than nbs The nbs career office always jokes about how smu students are only good at talking/presentation. But just look at linkedin for the career outcomes of NBS students compared to SMU students. The NBS guy will probably end up in Big4 while the SMU guy is in a bank.

I did receive an offer from SMU so I still got Plan B.  However, SMU school fees is higher than NUS by over 10k, which really makes me think whether should I take up SMU offer.  Personally, I like both SMU and NUS but school fees is really a factor that I must take into account of. Moreover, I do not have an extensive knowledge on how SMU IS curriculum. I wonder is it the same as NUS? or does it differ a lot?  So if NUS rejects me this year, I intend to reject SMU offer, and apply next year to NUS. The reason being university will no longer take into account of O Level result from Y2020 onwards. I was a PFP student and does not have an O Level result thus the long wait or possible rejection from NUS. So I would like to ask what are some of your thoughts on this?  1) Should I reject SMU this year and apply for NUS next year?  2) Do I stand a higher chance in getting accepted if I apply next year?

I graduated in 2017, coming from relevant Diploma with Merit CGPA 3.95.  I'm a PFP student as well but I do not meet the maths requirement. Thus, I've been trying DA as I have good CCA records (I won several awards in local IT competitions, represented SG in international competition before, worked as freelance developer as well as startup biz as well). I got invited for DA in 2017, but didn't manage to secure a spot. Applied last year & was rejected without interview and this year is my last year of applying as I managed to disrupt from National Service (I enlisted late). I currently accepted NTU Computer Science. I'm thinking whether to take a gap year to take O Level Maths to increase my chance as well as from Y2020 onwards, O level will not be taken into consideration. However, due to my family circumstances as well as discouragement from friends I most likely will be enrolling into NTU meanwhile just praying for some good news from NUS side. Haha. Are you a male or female?  If you are a male serving NS, You can accept SMU offer first and reapply next year.  I wish you all the best and hope you will get news from NUS soon!",11.251169660017343

But NTU have replied to offer an interview as well (same course). I am not sure if I should attend for the interview as I really like SMU but the tuition fee is really a huge burden. Overall I am wondering which school is better to attend? What are the pros and cons for both schools? I'm not sure about NTU, but I can share some from my perspective as an SMU Accountancy student.Similarities1. Content: NTU and SMU accounting modules are similar according to my NTU Accountancy friends.  More or less the same, but the depth may vary according to the electives taken. 2. Seminar style: SMU has it for all classes. NTU has it, but I'm not sure.3. Exemptions: - For professional qualifications, for SMU, you can get 12 out of 15 exemptions (provided you pass the requisite papers) for ICAEW. - For NTU, I'm not sure, but I've a friend who took advanced tax and (i heard) is exempted from CA Singapore's Tax paper. (Need to confirm.)Differences1. Cost SMU = $11k per annum for 4 years = $44k NTU = $8k per annum for 3 years = $24k Yup the cost difference is quite large (assuming we don't factor in hostel fees).2. Exemptions - This is more applicable if you're a poly student. If your poly's CGPA is >= 3.8, you can get a maximum of 10+ exemptions from SMU. This means you can graduate in 3 years from SMU even without overloading modules. 3. Location - SMU is more accessible, unless you stay in the west then NTU is more accessible.4. Ability to SU modules! - SMU: Has the option to SU two elective modules only when you file for graduation.  - NTU: Can SU some electives according to their website. 5. Graduate starting pay Already mentioned by SiaoLengKeng earlier in this thread, the starting pay for big 4 for both NTU and SMU graduates are similar. $3,000+ for audit.6. Other misc requirements - SMU has a compulsory 80 hours community service requirement + 1x overseas trip requirement. Overall, if we compare just by cost alone, NTU would be better because it is more cost efficient, but if we consider other factors, then there's no uni that's "better".

The emphasis on corporate skills, the professors, the school culture, and the proximity to the CBD all contribute to making students more effective management professionals.  4) SMU may not be known for the hostel experience, but the vibrancy of the CCAs more than makes up for it.

But NTU have replied to offer an interview as well (same course). I am not sure if I should attend for the interview as I really like SMU but the tuition fee is really a huge burden. Overall I am wondering which school is better to attend? What are the pros and cons for both schools? I'm not sure about NTU, but I can share some from my perspective as an SMU Accountancy student.Similarities1. Content: NTU and SMU accounting modules are similar according to my NTU Accountancy friends.  More or less the same, but the depth may vary according to the electives taken. 2. Seminar style: SMU has it for all classes. NTU has it, but I'm not sure.3. Exemptions: - For professional qualifications, for SMU, you can get 12 out of 15 exemptions (provided you pass the requisite papers) for ICAEW. - For NTU, I'm not sure, but I've a friend who took advanced tax and (i heard) is exempted from CA Singapore's Tax paper. (Need to confirm.)Differences1. Cost SMU = $11k per annum for 4 years = $44k NTU = $8k per annum for 3 years = $24k Yup the cost difference is quite large (assuming we don't factor in hostel fees).2. Exemptions - This is more applicable if you're a poly student. If your poly's CGPA is >= 3.8, you can get a maximum of 10+ exemptions from SMU. This means you can graduate in 3 years from SMU even without overloading modules. 3. Location - SMU is more accessible, unless you stay in the west then NTU is more accessible.4. Ability to SU modules! - SMU: Has the option to SU two elective modules only when you file for graduation.  - NTU: Can SU some electives according to their website. 5. Graduate starting pay Already mentioned by SiaoLengKeng earlier in this thread, the starting pay for big 4 for both NTU and SMU graduates are similar. $3,000+ for audit.6. Other misc requirements - SMU has a compulsory 80 hours community service requirement + 1x overseas trip requirement. Overall, if we compare just by cost alone, NTU would be better because it is more cost efficient, but if we consider other factors, then there's no uni that's "better". It'll depend on your personal preference!",10.439614868718463

For NTU, unlike SMU SOSS or NUS FASS, we don't go through those introductory courses and you don't pick your specialization after  year 1. You directly get into your course in NTU and get modules specifically (i.e. psychology) based.  This is a one of the advantage of being in NTU whereas, i heard sometimes if you want a specific course (i.e. psych) , you have to "fight" for it. The more popular the course, the harder to get in. Oh, btw most poly graduates are exempted from several GERPEs. (Modules that you are required to take ranging from sciences, business, liberal arts, etc.)  2. You can look into sociology too?

I believe NTU/NUS would be a better choice given your goals and aims in life! In ntu, besides taking the psych core mods, many NTU psych majors also take up NIE mods as their minors (such as in counselling, special needs, early childhood, youth pathopsychology, educational psychology and the list goes on HAHA) In nus, i believe there are social work modules that you can take either as a second major, minor or free electives (which seems to suit your passion of helping others!) I feel that SMU is more geared towards business and may not necessarily suits your future career aspirations (not because it's not as good but it doesn't seem in line with your goals) Also, maybe you can take into consideration the environment you work best in and maybe travelling time (because tbh, there shouldn't be that much diff between the 3 uni in terms of prestige- psychology in the 3 uni aren't ranked very highly in the world actually- most of my coursemates would love to enrol in overseas uni if they got the $$$)  also, I am not in the position to speak for poly students since Im from the JC route (so im not very sure ^^"; all I know is that NUS FASS cop is BBC/B and NTU psych cop is AAC/C to apply; I didnt apply to SMU psych- however, i heard it's based more on interviews rather than just your rp like for NTU/NUS? Im not very sure) Actually, you may also consider that NTU psych is a direct honours track, and direct honours is basically what it is; however, if you are not planning to take masters (in which having honours makes it easier to), you should save your money and just go NUS FASS (3 years if you cant/dont want to get honours) Hope this helps!

The culture is very cheena, so if you are not cheena, I strongly suggest NUS or SMU if not you will be like a fish out of water. In terms of career services, SMU is ahead.

They are way ahead of NUS and NTU in placing their students into good jobs. But school fees more expensive, and SMU doesn't have hall life (if you want to experience it). Also seems that the competition there is extremely fierce (class participation anyone?). But its in the city which also has some perks.

For NTU, unlike SMU SOSS or NUS FASS, we don't go through those introductory courses and you don't pick your specialization after  year 1. You directly get into your course in NTU and get modules specifically (i.e. psychology) based.  This is a one of the advantage of being in NTU whereas, i heard sometimes if you want a specific course (i.e. psych) , you have to "fight" for it. The more popular the course, the harder to get in. Oh, btw most poly graduates are exempted from several GERPEs. (Modules that you are required to take ranging from sciences, business, liberal arts, etc.)  2. You can look into sociology too? This degree is about the society and people. (You can DM me about sociology cause I'm in this course  )  3. You can always take a minor in ntu.",10.372231141645717

I would really appreciate any feedbacks or suggestions from any point of view.  Thanks guys!    Hi, im currently a y1 psych student in NTU! I believe NTU/NUS would be a better choice given your goals and aims in life! In ntu, besides taking the psych core mods, many NTU psych majors also take up NIE mods as their minors (such as in counselling, special needs, early childhood, youth pathopsychology, educational psychology and the list goes on HAHA) In nus, i believe there are social work modules that you can take either as a second major, minor or free electives (which seems to suit your passion of helping others!) I feel that SMU is more geared towards business and may not necessarily suits your future career aspirations (not because it's not as good but it doesn't seem in line with your goals) Also, maybe you can take into consideration the environment you work best in and maybe travelling time (because tbh, there shouldn't be that much diff between the 3 uni in terms of prestige- psychology in the 3 uni aren't ranked very highly in the world actually- most of my coursemates would love to enrol in overseas uni if they got the $$$)  also, I am not in the position to speak for poly students since Im from the JC route (so im not very sure ^^"; all I know is that NUS FASS cop is BBC/B and NTU psych cop is AAC/C to apply; I didnt apply to SMU psych- however, i heard it's based more on interviews rather than just your rp like for NTU/NUS? Im not very sure) Actually, you may also consider that NTU psych is a direct honours track, and direct honours is basically what it is; however, if you are not planning to take masters (in which having honours makes it easier to), you should save your money and just go NUS FASS (3 years if you cant/dont want to get honours) Hope this helps!

This is my personal opinion but I think poly kids are able to cope better if they go to smu rather than NUS or NTU.   You will definitely get a shock when you enter ntu. You would have to put in effort from week 1 if you want to maintain your gpa. In my first sem, majority of my classmates are from mid tier to top jcs (anderson, hwachong, raffles, acjc and etc). Their rank points are about 85 to 90. As such it is VERY VERY difficult to compete with them. Not sure about SMU. FrostWurm wrote:  Graduated from NBS several years ago. The culture is very cheena, so if you are not cheena, I strongly suggest NUS or SMU if not you will be like a fish out of water. In terms of career services, SMU is ahead. They usually get better placements, and students can do internships during the term due to the proximity of the school to CBD. They are way ahead of NUS and NTU in placing their students into good jobs. But school fees more expensive, and SMU doesn't have hall life (if you want to experience it). Also seems that the competition there is extremely fierce (class participation anyone?). But its in the city which also has some perks. Probably NTU if you just wanna grad quickly and be an auditor (although many also end up in management associate roles). SMU may be better if you are aiming for front office finance positions. actually for poly grads going uni & intend to go big4, better to go SIT. can become Associate 2 upon graduation and it is 2-3 years course. but if want big 3 then NTU because 3 years course.

I think the whole “3 vs 4 years” debate comes up every intake, and it’s easy to think linearly and say that NBS > SMU Biz/Acc. However, would like to point out that: 1) Depending on the number of exemptions, one may be able to complete the program in 3 or 3.5 years, rather than four. 2) SMU’s curriculum is more holistic in that you don’t just take courses specific to your domain, but are able to take a second major to learn a complementary discipline (ie Accounting w/ second major in Finance or Finance w/ a second major in Economics, and there are so many other combinations as well). The core modules also address topics that are quite pertinent to self-improvement, which I think is beneficial.  3) SMU is a management school, and so you get a number of inherent advantages from studying Biz/Acc here. The emphasis on corporate skills, the professors, the school culture, and the proximity to the CBD all contribute to making students more effective management professionals.  4) SMU may not be known for the hostel experience, but the vibrancy of the CCAs more than makes up for it.  Ultimately, I believe the choice has to made by oneself. But I do think the preceding points could definitely aid in one’s research to see what best fits him or her.

You can graduate faster in 3 years and start working earlier, but 4 years lets you do more internships and take more modules. Up to individual preference. 2) The nbs second major is severely limited. It is almost impossible to do a non-traditional second major because you only have 3 years to graduate and very few units for electives. 3) Contrary to popular belief, nbs is not well-known outside Singapore at all , although the ntu brand does have some mileage in asia. 4) CCA is a moot point becauase all unis have CCAs. However, it is true that hall life may be an important consideration for some applicants. And lastly, SMU has way better career services because: - They are located in the city, it is easy to get companies to come down or to get students to attend talks - Because they are located in the city, it is also easy for their students to do part-time internships - They have a much stronger alumni network - Their career service office is much more pro-active than nbs The nbs career office always jokes about how smu students are only good at talking/presentation. But just look at linkedin for the career outcomes of NBS students compared to SMU students. The NBS guy will probably end up in Big4 while the SMU guy is in a bank. For the record, nbs graduate here. rabbit1 wrote:  Sorry but reasons like "career office located in city" is superior or SMU has a stronger alumni network without substantiation sounds stupid and don't hold too much water.

Please share your views on it as well. I really hope to get into NUS IS (I am interested in the modules offered) but no news till now so I am already prepared to face the worst scenario. I did receive an offer from SMU so I still got Plan B.  However, SMU school fees is higher than NUS by over 10k, which really makes me think whether should I take up SMU offer.  Personally, I like both SMU and NUS but school fees is really a factor that I must take into account of. Moreover, I do not have an extensive knowledge on how SMU IS curriculum. I wonder is it the same as NUS? or does it differ a lot?  So if NUS rejects me this year, I intend to reject SMU offer, and apply next year to NUS. The reason being university will no longer take into account of O Level result from Y2020 onwards. I was a PFP student and does not have an O Level result thus the long wait or possible rejection from NUS. So I would like to ask what are some of your thoughts on this?  1) Should I reject SMU this year and apply for NUS next year?  2) Do I stand a higher chance in getting accepted if I apply next year? (My CGPA is above 3.9)  Thank you everyone for reading this long post lol just wanna listen to some of your advices/opinions. Thanks! Hi! I'm in similar situation. I graduated in 2017, coming from relevant Diploma with Merit CGPA 3.95.  I'm a PFP student as well but I do not meet the maths requirement. Thus, I've been trying DA as I have good CCA records (I won several awards in local IT competitions, represented SG in international competition before, worked as freelance developer as well as startup biz as well). I got invited for DA in 2017, but didn't manage to secure a spot. Applied last year & was rejected without interview and this year is my last year of applying as I managed to disrupt from National Service (I enlisted late). I currently accepted NTU Computer Science. I'm thinking whether to take a gap year to take O Level Maths to increase my chance as well as from Y2020 onwards, O level will not be taken into consideration. However, due to my family circumstances as well as discouragement from friends I most likely will be enrolling into NTU meanwhile just praying for some good news from NUS side. Haha. Are you a male or female?  If you are a male serving NS, You can accept SMU offer first and reapply next year.  I wish you all the best and hope you will get news from NUS soon!",11.251169660017343

This is my personal opinion but I think poly kids are able to cope better if they go to smu rather than NUS or NTU.   You will definitely get a shock when you enter ntu. You would have to put in effort from week 1 if you want to maintain your gpa. In my first sem, majority of my classmates are from mid tier to top jcs (anderson, hwachong, raffles, acjc and etc). Their rank points are about 85 to 90. As such it is VERY VERY difficult to compete with them. Not sure about SMU. FrostWurm wrote:  Graduated from NBS several years ago. The culture is very cheena, so if you are not cheena, I strongly suggest NUS or SMU if not you will be like a fish out of water. In terms of career services, SMU is ahead. They usually get better placements, and students can do internships during the term due to the proximity of the school to CBD. They are way ahead of NUS and NTU in placing their students into good jobs. But school fees more expensive, and SMU doesn't have hall life (if you want to experience it). Also seems that the competition there is extremely fierce (class participation anyone?). But its in the city which also has some perks. Probably NTU if you just wanna grad quickly and be an auditor (although many also end up in management associate roles). SMU may be better if you are aiming for front office finance positions. actually for poly grads going uni & intend to go big4, better to go SIT. can become Associate 2 upon graduation and it is 2-3 years course. but if want big 3 then NTU because 3 years course.

I think the whole “3 vs 4 years” debate comes up every intake, and it’s easy to think linearly and say that NBS > SMU Biz/Acc. However, would like to point out that: 1) Depending on the number of exemptions, one may be able to complete the program in 3 or 3.5 years, rather than four. 2) SMU’s curriculum is more holistic in that you don’t just take courses specific to your domain, but are able to take a second major to learn a complementary discipline (ie Accounting w/ second major in Finance or Finance w/ a second major in Economics, and there are so many other combinations as well). The core modules also address topics that are quite pertinent to self-improvement, which I think is beneficial.  3) SMU is a management school, and so you get a number of inherent advantages from studying Biz/Acc here. The emphasis on corporate skills, the professors, the school culture, and the proximity to the CBD all contribute to making students more effective management professionals.  4) SMU may not be known for the hostel experience, but the vibrancy of the CCAs more than makes up for it.  Ultimately, I believe the choice has to made by oneself. But I do think the preceding points could definitely aid in one’s research to see what best fits him or her.

You can graduate faster in 3 years and start working earlier, but 4 years lets you do more internships and take more modules. Up to individual preference. 2) The nbs second major is severely limited. It is almost impossible to do a non-traditional second major because you only have 3 years to graduate and very few units for electives. 3) Contrary to popular belief, nbs is not well-known outside Singapore at all , although the ntu brand does have some mileage in asia. 4) CCA is a moot point becauase all unis have CCAs. However, it is true that hall life may be an important consideration for some applicants. And lastly, SMU has way better career services because: - They are located in the city, it is easy to get companies to come down or to get students to attend talks - Because they are located in the city, it is also easy for their students to do part-time internships - They have a much stronger alumni network - Their career service office is much more pro-active than nbs The nbs career office always jokes about how smu students are only good at talking/presentation. But just look at linkedin for the career outcomes of NBS students compared to SMU students. The NBS guy will probably end up in Big4 while the SMU guy is in a bank.

Please share your views on it as well. I really hope to get into NUS IS (I am interested in the modules offered) but no news till now so I am already prepared to face the worst scenario. I did receive an offer from SMU so I still got Plan B.  However, SMU school fees is higher than NUS by over 10k, which really makes me think whether should I take up SMU offer.  Personally, I like both SMU and NUS but school fees is really a factor that I must take into account of. Moreover, I do not have an extensive knowledge on how SMU IS curriculum. I wonder is it the same as NUS? or does it differ a lot?  So if NUS rejects me this year, I intend to reject SMU offer, and apply next year to NUS. The reason being university will no longer take into account of O Level result from Y2020 onwards. I was a PFP student and does not have an O Level result thus the long wait or possible rejection from NUS. So I would like to ask what are some of your thoughts on this?  1) Should I reject SMU this year and apply for NUS next year?  2) Do I stand a higher chance in getting accepted if I apply next year? (My CGPA is above 3.9)  Thank you everyone for reading this long post lol just wanna listen to some of your advices/opinions. Thanks! Hi! I'm in similar situation. I graduated in 2017, coming from relevant Diploma with Merit CGPA 3.95.  I'm a PFP student as well but I do not meet the maths requirement. Thus, I've been trying DA as I have good CCA records (I won several awards in local IT competitions, represented SG in international competition before, worked as freelance developer as well as startup biz as well). I got invited for DA in 2017, but didn't manage to secure a spot. Applied last year & was rejected without interview and this year is my last year of applying as I managed to disrupt from National Service (I enlisted late). I currently accepted NTU Computer Science. I'm thinking whether to take a gap year to take O Level Maths to increase my chance as well as from Y2020 onwards, O level will not be taken into consideration. However, due to my family circumstances as well as discouragement from friends I most likely will be enrolling into NTU meanwhile just praying for some good news from NUS side. Haha. Are you a male or female?  If you are a male serving NS, You can accept SMU offer first and reapply next year.  I wish you all the best and hope you will get news from NUS soon!",11.251169660017343

Overall I am wondering which school is better to attend? What are the pros and cons for both schools? I'm not sure about NTU, but I can share some from my perspective as an SMU Accountancy student.Similarities1. Content: NTU and SMU accounting modules are similar according to my NTU Accountancy friends.  More or less the same, but the depth may vary according to the electives taken. 2. Seminar style: SMU has it for all classes. NTU has it, but I'm not sure.3. Exemptions: - For professional qualifications, for SMU, you can get 12 out of 15 exemptions (provided you pass the requisite papers) for ICAEW. - For NTU, I'm not sure, but I've a friend who took advanced tax and (i heard) is exempted from CA Singapore's Tax paper. (Need to confirm.)Differences1. Cost SMU = $11k per annum for 4 years = $44k NTU = $8k per annum for 3 years = $24k Yup the cost difference is quite large (assuming we don't factor in hostel fees).2. Exemptions - This is more applicable if you're a poly student. If your poly's CGPA is >= 3.8, you can get a maximum of 10+ exemptions from SMU. This means you can graduate in 3 years from SMU even without overloading modules. 3. Location - SMU is more accessible, unless you stay in the west then NTU is more accessible.4. Ability to SU modules! - SMU: Has the option to SU two elective modules only when you file for graduation.  - NTU: Can SU some electives according to their website. 5. Graduate starting pay Already mentioned by SiaoLengKeng earlier in this thread, the starting pay for big 4 for both NTU and SMU graduates are similar. $3,000+ for audit.6. Other misc requirements - SMU has a compulsory 80 hours community service requirement + 1x overseas trip requirement.

But NTU have replied to offer an interview as well (same course). I am not sure if I should attend for the interview as I really like SMU but the tuition fee is really a huge burden. Overall I am wondering which school is better to attend? What are the pros and cons for both schools? I'm not sure about NTU, but I can share some from my perspective as an SMU Accountancy student.Similarities1. Content: NTU and SMU accounting modules are similar according to my NTU Accountancy friends.  More or less the same, but the depth may vary according to the electives taken. 2. Seminar style: SMU has it for all classes. NTU has it, but I'm not sure.3. Exemptions: - For professional qualifications, for SMU, you can get 12 out of 15 exemptions (provided you pass the requisite papers) for ICAEW. - For NTU, I'm not sure, but I've a friend who took advanced tax and (i heard) is exempted from CA Singapore's Tax paper. (Need to confirm.)Differences1. Cost SMU = $11k per annum for 4 years = $44k NTU = $8k per annum for 3 years = $24k Yup the cost difference is quite large (assuming we don't factor in hostel fees).2. Exemptions - This is more applicable if you're a poly student. If your poly's CGPA is >= 3.8, you can get a maximum of 10+ exemptions from SMU. This means you can graduate in 3 years from SMU even without overloading modules. 3. Location - SMU is more accessible, unless you stay in the west then NTU is more accessible.4. Ability to SU modules! - SMU: Has the option to SU two elective modules only when you file for graduation.  - NTU: Can SU some electives according to their website. 5. Graduate starting pay Already mentioned by SiaoLengKeng earlier in this thread, the starting pay for big 4 for both NTU and SMU graduates are similar. $3,000+ for audit.6. Other misc requirements - SMU has a compulsory 80 hours community service requirement + 1x overseas trip requirement. Overall, if we compare just by cost alone, NTU would be better because it is more cost efficient, but if we consider other factors, then there's no uni that's "better". It'll depend on your personal preference!",10.439614868718463

For NTU, unlike SMU SOSS or NUS FASS, we don't go through those introductory courses and you don't pick your specialization after  year 1. You directly get into your course in NTU and get modules specifically (i.e. psychology) based.  This is a one of the advantage of being in NTU whereas, i heard sometimes if you want a specific course (i.e. psych) , you have to "fight" for it. The more popular the course, the harder to get in. Oh, btw most poly graduates are exempted from several GERPEs. (Modules that you are required to take ranging from sciences, business, liberal arts, etc.)  2. You can look into sociology too?

I believe NTU/NUS would be a better choice given your goals and aims in life! In ntu, besides taking the psych core mods, many NTU psych majors also take up NIE mods as their minors (such as in counselling, special needs, early childhood, youth pathopsychology, educational psychology and the list goes on HAHA) In nus, i believe there are social work modules that you can take either as a second major, minor or free electives (which seems to suit your passion of helping others!) I feel that SMU is more geared towards business and may not necessarily suits your future career aspirations (not because it's not as good but it doesn't seem in line with your goals) Also, maybe you can take into consideration the environment you work best in and maybe travelling time (because tbh, there shouldn't be that much diff between the 3 uni in terms of prestige- psychology in the 3 uni aren't ranked very highly in the world actually- most of my coursemates would love to enrol in overseas uni if they got the $$$)  also, I am not in the position to speak for poly students since Im from the JC route (so im not very sure ^^"; all I know is that NUS FASS cop is BBC/B and NTU psych cop is AAC/C to apply; I didnt apply to SMU psych- however, i heard it's based more on interviews rather than just your rp like for NTU/NUS? Im not very sure) Actually, you may also consider that NTU psych is a direct honours track, and direct honours is basically what it is; however, if you are not planning to take masters (in which having honours makes it easier to), you should save your money and just go NUS FASS (3 years if you cant/dont want to get honours) Hope this helps!

But NTU have replied to offer an interview as well (same course). I am not sure if I should attend for the interview as I really like SMU but the tuition fee is really a huge burden. Overall I am wondering which school is better to attend? What are the pros and cons for both schools? I'm not sure about NTU, but I can share some from my perspective as an SMU Accountancy student.Similarities1. Content: NTU and SMU accounting modules are similar according to my NTU Accountancy friends.  More or less the same, but the depth may vary according to the electives taken. 2. Seminar style: SMU has it for all classes. NTU has it, but I'm not sure.3. Exemptions: - For professional qualifications, for SMU, you can get 12 out of 15 exemptions (provided you pass the requisite papers) for ICAEW. - For NTU, I'm not sure, but I've a friend who took advanced tax and (i heard) is exempted from CA Singapore's Tax paper. (Need to confirm.)Differences1. Cost SMU = $11k per annum for 4 years = $44k NTU = $8k per annum for 3 years = $24k Yup the cost difference is quite large (assuming we don't factor in hostel fees).2. Exemptions - This is more applicable if you're a poly student. If your poly's CGPA is >= 3.8, you can get a maximum of 10+ exemptions from SMU. This means you can graduate in 3 years from SMU even without overloading modules. 3. Location - SMU is more accessible, unless you stay in the west then NTU is more accessible.4. Ability to SU modules! - SMU: Has the option to SU two elective modules only when you file for graduation.  - NTU: Can SU some electives according to their website. 5. Graduate starting pay Already mentioned by SiaoLengKeng earlier in this thread, the starting pay for big 4 for both NTU and SMU graduates are similar. $3,000+ for audit.6. Other misc requirements - SMU has a compulsory 80 hours community service requirement + 1x overseas trip requirement. Overall, if we compare just by cost alone, NTU would be better because it is more cost efficient, but if we consider other factors, then there's no uni that's "better". It'll depend on your personal preference!",10.439614868718463

For NTU, unlike SMU SOSS or NUS FASS, we don't go through those introductory courses and you don't pick your specialization after  year 1. You directly get into your course in NTU and get modules specifically (i.e. psychology) based.  This is a one of the advantage of being in NTU whereas, i heard sometimes if you want a specific course (i.e. psych) , you have to "fight" for it. The more popular the course, the harder to get in. Oh, btw most poly graduates are exempted from several GERPEs. (Modules that you are required to take ranging from sciences, business, liberal arts, etc.)  2. You can look into sociology too? This degree is about the society and people. (You can DM me about sociology cause I'm in this course  )  3. You can always take a minor in ntu.",10.372231141645717

I would really appreciate any feedbacks or suggestions from any point of view.  Thanks guys!    Hi, im currently a y1 psych student in NTU! I believe NTU/NUS would be a better choice given your goals and aims in life! In ntu, besides taking the psych core mods, many NTU psych majors also take up NIE mods as their minors (such as in counselling, special needs, early childhood, youth pathopsychology, educational psychology and the list goes on HAHA) In nus, i believe there are social work modules that you can take either as a second major, minor or free electives (which seems to suit your passion of helping others!) I feel that SMU is more geared towards business and may not necessarily suits your future career aspirations (not because it's not as good but it doesn't seem in line with your goals) Also, maybe you can take into consideration the environment you work best in and maybe travelling time (because tbh, there shouldn't be that much diff between the 3 uni in terms of prestige- psychology in the 3 uni aren't ranked very highly in the world actually- most of my coursemates would love to enrol in overseas uni if they got the $$$)  also, I am not in the position to speak for poly students since Im from the JC route (so im not very sure ^^"; all I know is that NUS FASS cop is BBC/B and NTU psych cop is AAC/C to apply; I didnt apply to SMU psych- however, i heard it's based more on interviews rather than just your rp like for NTU/NUS? Im not very sure) Actually, you may also consider that NTU psych is a direct honours track, and direct honours is basically what it is; however, if you are not planning to take masters (in which having honours makes it easier to), you should save your money and just go NUS FASS (3 years if you cant/dont want to get honours) Hope this helps!

This is my personal opinion but I think poly kids are able to cope better if they go to smu rather than NUS or NTU.   You will definitely get a shock when you enter ntu. You would have to put in effort from week 1 if you want to maintain your gpa. In my first sem, majority of my classmates are from mid tier to top jcs (anderson, hwachong, raffles, acjc and etc). Their rank points are about 85 to 90. As such it is VERY VERY difficult to compete with them. Not sure about SMU. FrostWurm wrote:  Graduated from NBS several years ago. The culture is very cheena, so if you are not cheena, I strongly suggest NUS or SMU if not you will be like a fish out of water. In terms of career services, SMU is ahead. They usually get better placements, and students can do internships during the term due to the proximity of the school to CBD. They are way ahead of NUS and NTU in placing their students into good jobs. But school fees more expensive, and SMU doesn't have hall life (if you want to experience it). Also seems that the competition there is extremely fierce (class participation anyone?). But its in the city which also has some perks. Probably NTU if you just wanna grad quickly and be an auditor (although many also end up in management associate roles). SMU may be better if you are aiming for front office finance positions. actually for poly grads going uni & intend to go big4, better to go SIT. can become Associate 2 upon graduation and it is 2-3 years course. but if want big 3 then NTU because 3 years course.

I think the whole “3 vs 4 years” debate comes up every intake, and it’s easy to think linearly and say that NBS > SMU Biz/Acc. However, would like to point out that: 1) Depending on the number of exemptions, one may be able to complete the program in 3 or 3.5 years, rather than four. 2) SMU’s curriculum is more holistic in that you don’t just take courses specific to your domain, but are able to take a second major to learn a complementary discipline (ie Accounting w/ second major in Finance or Finance w/ a second major in Economics, and there are so many other combinations as well). The core modules also address topics that are quite pertinent to self-improvement, which I think is beneficial.  3) SMU is a management school, and so you get a number of inherent advantages from studying Biz/Acc here. The emphasis on corporate skills, the professors, the school culture, and the proximity to the CBD all contribute to making students more effective management professionals.  4) SMU may not be known for the hostel experience, but the vibrancy of the CCAs more than makes up for it.  Ultimately, I believe the choice has to made by oneself. But I do think the preceding points could definitely aid in one’s research to see what best fits him or her.

You can graduate faster in 3 years and start working earlier, but 4 years lets you do more internships and take more modules. Up to individual preference. 2) The nbs second major is severely limited. It is almost impossible to do a non-traditional second major because you only have 3 years to graduate and very few units for electives. 3) Contrary to popular belief, nbs is not well-known outside Singapore at all , although the ntu brand does have some mileage in asia. 4) CCA is a moot point becauase all unis have CCAs. However, it is true that hall life may be an important consideration for some applicants. And lastly, SMU has way better career services because: - They are located in the city, it is easy to get companies to come down or to get students to attend talks - Because they are located in the city, it is also easy for their students to do part-time internships - They have a much stronger alumni network - Their career service office is much more pro-active than nbs The nbs career office always jokes about how smu students are only good at talking/presentation. But just look at linkedin for the career outcomes of NBS students compared to SMU students. The NBS guy will probably end up in Big4 while the SMU guy is in a bank.

I would really appreciate any feedbacks or suggestions from any point of view.  Thanks guys!    Hi, im currently a y1 psych student in NTU! I believe NTU/NUS would be a better choice given your goals and aims in life! In ntu, besides taking the psych core mods, many NTU psych majors also take up NIE mods as their minors (such as in counselling, special needs, early childhood, youth pathopsychology, educational psychology and the list goes on HAHA) In nus, i believe there are social work modules that you can take either as a second major, minor or free electives (which seems to suit your passion of helping others!) I feel that SMU is more geared towards business and may not necessarily suits your future career aspirations (not because it's not as good but it doesn't seem in line with your goals) Also, maybe you can take into consideration the environment you work best in and maybe travelling time (because tbh, there shouldn't be that much diff between the 3 uni in terms of prestige- psychology in the 3 uni aren't ranked very highly in the world actually- most of my coursemates would love to enrol in overseas uni if they got the $$$)  also, I am not in the position to speak for poly students since Im from the JC route (so im not very sure ^^"; all I know is that NUS FASS cop is BBC/B and NTU psych cop is AAC/C to apply; I didnt apply to SMU psych- however, i heard it's based more on interviews rather than just your rp like for NTU/NUS? Im not very sure) Actually, you may also consider that NTU psych is a direct honours track, and direct honours is basically what it is; however, if you are not planning to take masters (in which having honours makes it easier to), you should save your money and just go NUS FASS (3 years if you cant/dont want to get honours) Hope this helps!

If you're heading to big 4 after grad, heard the starting pay is more or less the same. If so, why go for a 4 year's course?  Ntu offers plenty of exchange opportunities too.  This is my personal opinion but I think poly kids are able to cope better if they go to smu rather than NUS or NTU.   You will definitely get a shock when you enter ntu. You would have to put in effort from week 1 if you want to maintain your gpa. In my first sem, majority of my classmates are from mid tier to top jcs (anderson, hwachong, raffles, acjc and etc). Their rank points are about 85 to 90. As such it is VERY VERY difficult to compete with them. Not sure about SMU. FrostWurm wrote:  Graduated from NBS several years ago. The culture is very cheena, so if you are not cheena, I strongly suggest NUS or SMU if not you will be like a fish out of water. In terms of career services, SMU is ahead. They usually get better placements, and students can do internships during the term due to the proximity of the school to CBD. They are way ahead of NUS and NTU in placing their students into good jobs. But school fees more expensive, and SMU doesn't have hall life (if you want to experience it). Also seems that the competition there is extremely fierce (class participation anyone?). But its in the city which also has some perks. Probably NTU if you just wanna grad quickly and be an auditor (although many also end up in management associate roles). SMU may be better if you are aiming for front office finance positions. actually for poly grads going uni & intend to go big4, better to go SIT. can become Associate 2 upon graduation and it is 2-3 years course. but if want big 3 then NTU because 3 years course.

I think the whole “3 vs 4 years” debate comes up every intake, and it’s easy to think linearly and say that NBS > SMU Biz/Acc. However, would like to point out that: 1) Depending on the number of exemptions, one may be able to complete the program in 3 or 3.5 years, rather than four. 2) SMU’s curriculum is more holistic in that you don’t just take courses specific to your domain, but are able to take a second major to learn a complementary discipline (ie Accounting w/ second major in Finance or Finance w/ a second major in Economics, and there are so many other combinations as well). The core modules also address topics that are quite pertinent to self-improvement, which I think is beneficial.  3) SMU is a management school, and so you get a number of inherent advantages from studying Biz/Acc here. The emphasis on corporate skills, the professors, the school culture, and the proximity to the CBD all contribute to making students more effective management professionals.  4) SMU may not be known for the hostel experience, but the vibrancy of the CCAs more than makes up for it.  Ultimately, I believe the choice has to made by oneself. But I do think the preceding points could definitely aid in one’s research to see what best fits him or her.

You can graduate faster in 3 years and start working earlier, but 4 years lets you do more internships and take more modules. Up to individual preference. 2) The nbs second major is severely limited. It is almost impossible to do a non-traditional second major because you only have 3 years to graduate and very few units for electives. 3) Contrary to popular belief, nbs is not well-known outside Singapore at all , although the ntu brand does have some mileage in asia. 4) CCA is a moot point becauase all unis have CCAs. However, it is true that hall life may be an important consideration for some applicants. And lastly, SMU has way better career services because: - They are located in the city, it is easy to get companies to come down or to get students to attend talks - Because they are located in the city, it is also easy for their students to do part-time internships - They have a much stronger alumni network - Their career service office is much more pro-active than nbs The nbs career office always jokes about how smu students are only good at talking/presentation. But just look at linkedin for the career outcomes of NBS students compared to SMU students. The NBS guy will probably end up in Big4 while the SMU guy is in a bank. For the record, nbs graduate here. rabbit1 wrote:  Sorry but reasons like "career office located in city" is superior or SMU has a stronger alumni network without substantiation sounds stupid and don't hold too much water.

Please share your views on it as well. I really hope to get into NUS IS (I am interested in the modules offered) but no news till now so I am already prepared to face the worst scenario. I did receive an offer from SMU so I still got Plan B.  However, SMU school fees is higher than NUS by over 10k, which really makes me think whether should I take up SMU offer.  Personally, I like both SMU and NUS but school fees is really a factor that I must take into account of. Moreover, I do not have an extensive knowledge on how SMU IS curriculum. I wonder is it the same as NUS? or does it differ a lot?  So if NUS rejects me this year, I intend to reject SMU offer, and apply next year to NUS. The reason being university will no longer take into account of O Level result from Y2020 onwards. I was a PFP student and does not have an O Level result thus the long wait or possible rejection from NUS. So I would like to ask what are some of your thoughts on this?  1) Should I reject SMU this year and apply for NUS next year?  2) Do I stand a higher chance in getting accepted if I apply next year? (My CGPA is above 3.9)  Thank you everyone for reading this long post lol just wanna listen to some of your advices/opinions. Thanks! Hi! I'm in similar situation. I graduated in 2017, coming from relevant Diploma with Merit CGPA 3.95.  I'm a PFP student as well but I do not meet the maths requirement. Thus, I've been trying DA as I have good CCA records (I won several awards in local IT competitions, represented SG in international competition before, worked as freelance developer as well as startup biz as well). I got invited for DA in 2017, but didn't manage to secure a spot. Applied last year & was rejected without interview and this year is my last year of applying as I managed to disrupt from National Service (I enlisted late). I currently accepted NTU Computer Science. I'm thinking whether to take a gap year to take O Level Maths to increase my chance as well as from Y2020 onwards, O level will not be taken into consideration. However, due to my family circumstances as well as discouragement from friends I most likely will be enrolling into NTU meanwhile just praying for some good news from NUS side. Haha. Are you a male or female?  If you are a male serving NS, You can accept SMU offer first and reapply next year.  I wish you all the best and hope you will get news from NUS soon!",11.251169660017343

I believe NTU/NUS would be a better choice given your goals and aims in life! In ntu, besides taking the psych core mods, many NTU psych majors also take up NIE mods as their minors (such as in counselling, special needs, early childhood, youth pathopsychology, educational psychology and the list goes on HAHA) In nus, i believe there are social work modules that you can take either as a second major, minor or free electives (which seems to suit your passion of helping others!) I feel that SMU is more geared towards business and may not necessarily suits your future career aspirations (not because it's not as good but it doesn't seem in line with your goals) Also, maybe you can take into consideration the environment you work best in and maybe travelling time (because tbh, there shouldn't be that much diff between the 3 uni in terms of prestige- psychology in the 3 uni aren't ranked very highly in the world actually- most of my coursemates would love to enrol in overseas uni if they got the $$$)  also, I am not in the position to speak for poly students since Im from the JC route (so im not very sure ^^"; all I know is that NUS FASS cop is BBC/B and NTU psych cop is AAC/C to apply; I didnt apply to SMU psych- however, i heard it's based more on interviews rather than just your rp like for NTU/NUS?

Please share your views on it as well. I really hope to get into NUS IS (I am interested in the modules offered) but no news till now so I am already prepared to face the worst scenario. I did receive an offer from SMU so I still got Plan B.  However, SMU school fees is higher than NUS by over 10k, which really makes me think whether should I take up SMU offer.  Personally, I like both SMU and NUS but school fees is really a factor that I must take into account of. Moreover, I do not have an extensive knowledge on how SMU IS curriculum. I wonder is it the same as NUS? or does it differ a lot?  So if NUS rejects me this year, I intend to reject SMU offer, and apply next year to NUS. The reason being university will no longer take into account of O Level result from Y2020 onwards. I was a PFP student and does not have an O Level result thus the long wait or possible rejection from NUS. So I would like to ask what are some of your thoughts on this?  1) Should I reject SMU this year and apply for NUS next year?  2) Do I stand a higher chance in getting accepted if I apply next year? (My CGPA is above 3.9)  Thank you everyone for reading this long post lol just wanna listen to some of your advices/opinions. Thanks! Hi! I'm in similar situation. I graduated in 2017, coming from relevant Diploma with Merit CGPA 3.95.  I'm a PFP student as well but I do not meet the maths requirement. Thus, I've been trying DA as I have good CCA records (I won several awards in local IT competitions, represented SG in international competition before, worked as freelance developer as well as startup biz as well). I got invited for DA in 2017, but didn't manage to secure a spot. Applied last year & was rejected without interview and this year is my last year of applying as I managed to disrupt from National Service (I enlisted late). I currently accepted NTU Computer Science. I'm thinking whether to take a gap year to take O Level Maths to increase my chance as well as from Y2020 onwards, O level will not be taken into consideration. However, due to my family circumstances as well as discouragement from friends I most likely will be enrolling into NTU meanwhile just praying for some good news from NUS side. Haha. Are you a male or female?  If you are a male serving NS, You can accept SMU offer first and reapply next year.  I wish you all the best and hope you will get news from NUS soon!",11.251169660017343

But NTU have replied to offer an interview as well (same course). I am not sure if I should attend for the interview as I really like SMU but the tuition fee is really a huge burden. Overall I am wondering which school is better to attend? What are the pros and cons for both schools? I'm not sure about NTU, but I can share some from my perspective as an SMU Accountancy student.Similarities1. Content: NTU and SMU accounting modules are similar according to my NTU Accountancy friends.  More or less the same, but the depth may vary according to the electives taken. 2. Seminar style: SMU has it for all classes. NTU has it, but I'm not sure.3. Exemptions: - For professional qualifications, for SMU, you can get 12 out of 15 exemptions (provided you pass the requisite papers) for ICAEW. - For NTU, I'm not sure, but I've a friend who took advanced tax and (i heard) is exempted from CA Singapore's Tax paper. (Need to confirm.)Differences1. Cost SMU = $11k per annum for 4 years = $44k NTU = $8k per annum for 3 years = $24k Yup the cost difference is quite large (assuming we don't factor in hostel fees).2. Exemptions - This is more applicable if you're a poly student. If your poly's CGPA is >= 3.8, you can get a maximum of 10+ exemptions from SMU. This means you can graduate in 3 years from SMU even without overloading modules. 3. Location - SMU is more accessible, unless you stay in the west then NTU is more accessible.4. Ability to SU modules! - SMU: Has the option to SU two elective modules only when you file for graduation.  - NTU: Can SU some electives according to their website. 5. Graduate starting pay Already mentioned by SiaoLengKeng earlier in this thread, the starting pay for big 4 for both NTU and SMU graduates are similar. $3,000+ for audit.6. Other misc requirements - SMU has a compulsory 80 hours community service requirement + 1x overseas trip requirement. Overall, if we compare just by cost alone, NTU would be better because it is more cost efficient, but if we consider other factors, then there's no uni that's "better". It'll depend on your personal preference!",10.439614868718463

For NTU, unlike SMU SOSS or NUS FASS, we don't go through those introductory courses and you don't pick your specialization after  year 1. You directly get into your course in NTU and get modules specifically (i.e. psychology) based.  This is a one of the advantage of being in NTU whereas, i heard sometimes if you want a specific course (i.e. psych) , you have to "fight" for it. The more popular the course, the harder to get in. Oh, btw most poly graduates are exempted from several GERPEs. (Modules that you are required to take ranging from sciences, business, liberal arts, etc.)  2. You can look into sociology too?

But NTU have replied to offer an interview as well (same course). I am not sure if I should attend for the interview as I really like SMU but the tuition fee is really a huge burden. Overall I am wondering which school is better to attend? What are the pros and cons for both schools? I'm not sure about NTU, but I can share some from my perspective as an SMU Accountancy student.Similarities1. Content: NTU and SMU accounting modules are similar according to my NTU Accountancy friends.  More or less the same, but the depth may vary according to the electives taken. 2. Seminar style: SMU has it for all classes. NTU has it, but I'm not sure.3. Exemptions: - For professional qualifications, for SMU, you can get 12 out of 15 exemptions (provided you pass the requisite papers) for ICAEW. - For NTU, I'm not sure, but I've a friend who took advanced tax and (i heard) is exempted from CA Singapore's Tax paper. (Need to confirm.)Differences1. Cost SMU = $11k per annum for 4 years = $44k NTU = $8k per annum for 3 years = $24k Yup the cost difference is quite large (assuming we don't factor in hostel fees).2. Exemptions - This is more applicable if you're a poly student. If your poly's CGPA is >= 3.8, you can get a maximum of 10+ exemptions from SMU. This means you can graduate in 3 years from SMU even without overloading modules. 3. Location - SMU is more accessible, unless you stay in the west then NTU is more accessible.4. Ability to SU modules! - SMU: Has the option to SU two elective modules only when you file for graduation.  - NTU: Can SU some electives according to their website. 5. Graduate starting pay Already mentioned by SiaoLengKeng earlier in this thread, the starting pay for big 4 for both NTU and SMU graduates are similar. $3,000+ for audit.6. Other misc requirements - SMU has a compulsory 80 hours community service requirement + 1x overseas trip requirement. Overall, if we compare just by cost alone, NTU would be better because it is more cost efficient, but if we consider other factors, then there's no uni that's "better". It'll depend on your personal preference!",10.439614868718463

For NTU, unlike SMU SOSS or NUS FASS, we don't go through those introductory courses and you don't pick your specialization after  year 1. You directly get into your course in NTU and get modules specifically (i.e. psychology) based.  This is a one of the advantage of being in NTU whereas, i heard sometimes if you want a specific course (i.e. psych) , you have to "fight" for it. The more popular the course, the harder to get in. Oh, btw most poly graduates are exempted from several GERPEs. (Modules that you are required to take ranging from sciences, business, liberal arts, etc.)  2. You can look into sociology too? This degree is about the society and people. (You can DM me about sociology cause I'm in this course  )  3. You can always take a minor in ntu.",10.372231141645717

I believe NTU/NUS would be a better choice given your goals and aims in life! In ntu, besides taking the psych core mods, many NTU psych majors also take up NIE mods as their minors (such as in counselling, special needs, early childhood, youth pathopsychology, educational psychology and the list goes on HAHA) In nus, i believe there are social work modules that you can take either as a second major, minor or free electives (which seems to suit your passion of helping others!) I feel that SMU is more geared towards business and may not necessarily suits your future career aspirations (not because it's not as good but it doesn't seem in line with your goals) Also, maybe you can take into consideration the environment you work best in and maybe travelling time (because tbh, there shouldn't be that much diff between the 3 uni in terms of prestige- psychology in the 3 uni aren't ranked very highly in the world actually- most of my coursemates would love to enrol in overseas uni if they got the $$$)  also, I am not in the position to speak for poly students since Im from the JC route (so im not very sure ^^"; all I know is that NUS FASS cop is BBC/B and NTU psych cop is AAC/C to apply; I didnt apply to SMU psych- however, i heard it's based more on interviews rather than just your rp like for NTU/NUS? Im not very sure) Actually, you may also consider that NTU psych is a direct honours track, and direct honours is basically what it is; however, if you are not planning to take masters (in which having honours makes it easier to), you should save your money and just go NUS FASS (3 years if you cant/dont want to get honours) Hope this helps!

This is my personal opinion but I think poly kids are able to cope better if they go to smu rather than NUS or NTU.   You will definitely get a shock when you enter ntu. You would have to put in effort from week 1 if you want to maintain your gpa. In my first sem, majority of my classmates are from mid tier to top jcs (anderson, hwachong, raffles, acjc and etc). Their rank points are about 85 to 90. As such it is VERY VERY difficult to compete with them. Not sure about SMU. FrostWurm wrote:  Graduated from NBS several years ago. The culture is very cheena, so if you are not cheena, I strongly suggest NUS or SMU if not you will be like a fish out of water. In terms of career services, SMU is ahead. They usually get better placements, and students can do internships during the term due to the proximity of the school to CBD. They are way ahead of NUS and NTU in placing their students into good jobs. But school fees more expensive, and SMU doesn't have hall life (if you want to experience it). Also seems that the competition there is extremely fierce (class participation anyone?). But its in the city which also has some perks. Probably NTU if you just wanna grad quickly and be an auditor (although many also end up in management associate roles). SMU may be better if you are aiming for front office finance positions. actually for poly grads going uni & intend to go big4, better to go SIT. can become Associate 2 upon graduation and it is 2-3 years course. but if want big 3 then NTU because 3 years course.

I think the whole “3 vs 4 years” debate comes up every intake, and it’s easy to think linearly and say that NBS > SMU Biz/Acc. However, would like to point out that: 1) Depending on the number of exemptions, one may be able to complete the program in 3 or 3.5 years, rather than four. 2) SMU’s curriculum is more holistic in that you don’t just take courses specific to your domain, but are able to take a second major to learn a complementary discipline (ie Accounting w/ second major in Finance or Finance w/ a second major in Economics, and there are so many other combinations as well). The core modules also address topics that are quite pertinent to self-improvement, which I think is beneficial.  3) SMU is a management school, and so you get a number of inherent advantages from studying Biz/Acc here. The emphasis on corporate skills, the professors, the school culture, and the proximity to the CBD all contribute to making students more effective management professionals.  4) SMU may not be known for the hostel experience, but the vibrancy of the CCAs more than makes up for it.  Ultimately, I believe the choice has to made by oneself. But I do think the preceding points could definitely aid in one’s research to see what best fits him or her.

It is almost impossible to do a non-traditional second major because you only have 3 years to graduate and very few units for electives. 3) Contrary to popular belief, nbs is not well-known outside Singapore at all , although the ntu brand does have some mileage in asia. 4) CCA is a moot point becauase all unis have CCAs.

For NTU, unlike SMU SOSS or NUS FASS, we don't go through those introductory courses and you don't pick your specialization after  year 1. You directly get into your course in NTU and get modules specifically (i.e. psychology) based.  This is a one of the advantage of being in NTU whereas, i heard sometimes if you want a specific course (i.e. psych) , you have to "fight" for it. The more popular the course, the harder to get in. Oh, btw most poly graduates are exempted from several GERPEs. (Modules that you are required to take ranging from sciences, business, liberal arts, etc.)  2. You can look into sociology too? This degree is about the society and people. (You can DM me about sociology cause I'm in this course  )  3. You can always take a minor in ntu.",10.372231141645717

I would really appreciate any feedbacks or suggestions from any point of view.  Thanks guys!    Hi, im currently a y1 psych student in NTU! I believe NTU/NUS would be a better choice given your goals and aims in life! In ntu, besides taking the psych core mods, many NTU psych majors also take up NIE mods as their minors (such as in counselling, special needs, early childhood, youth pathopsychology, educational psychology and the list goes on HAHA) In nus, i believe there are social work modules that you can take either as a second major, minor or free electives (which seems to suit your passion of helping others!) I feel that SMU is more geared towards business and may not necessarily suits your future career aspirations (not because it's not as good but it doesn't seem in line with your goals) Also, maybe you can take into consideration the environment you work best in and maybe travelling time (because tbh, there shouldn't be that much diff between the 3 uni in terms of prestige- psychology in the 3 uni aren't ranked very highly in the world actually- most of my coursemates would love to enrol in overseas uni if they got the $$$)  also, I am not in the position to speak for poly students since Im from the JC route (so im not very sure ^^"; all I know is that NUS FASS cop is BBC/B and NTU psych cop is AAC/C to apply; I didnt apply to SMU psych- however, i heard it's based more on interviews rather than just your rp like for NTU/NUS? Im not very sure) Actually, you may also consider that NTU psych is a direct honours track, and direct honours is basically what it is; however, if you are not planning to take masters (in which having honours makes it easier to), you should save your money and just go NUS FASS (3 years if you cant/dont want to get honours) Hope this helps!

If you're heading to big 4 after grad, heard the starting pay is more or less the same. If so, why go for a 4 year's course?  Ntu offers plenty of exchange opportunities too.  This is my personal opinion but I think poly kids are able to cope better if they go to smu rather than NUS or NTU.   You will definitely get a shock when you enter ntu. You would have to put in effort from week 1 if you want to maintain your gpa. In my first sem, majority of my classmates are from mid tier to top jcs (anderson, hwachong, raffles, acjc and etc). Their rank points are about 85 to 90. As such it is VERY VERY difficult to compete with them. Not sure about SMU. FrostWurm wrote:  Graduated from NBS several years ago. The culture is very cheena, so if you are not cheena, I strongly suggest NUS or SMU if not you will be like a fish out of water. In terms of career services, SMU is ahead. They usually get better placements, and students can do internships during the term due to the proximity of the school to CBD. They are way ahead of NUS and NTU in placing their students into good jobs. But school fees more expensive, and SMU doesn't have hall life (if you want to experience it). Also seems that the competition there is extremely fierce (class participation anyone?). But its in the city which also has some perks. Probably NTU if you just wanna grad quickly and be an auditor (although many also end up in management associate roles). SMU may be better if you are aiming for front office finance positions. actually for poly grads going uni & intend to go big4, better to go SIT. can become Associate 2 upon graduation and it is 2-3 years course. but if want big 3 then NTU because 3 years course.

I think the whole “3 vs 4 years” debate comes up every intake, and it’s easy to think linearly and say that NBS > SMU Biz/Acc. However, would like to point out that: 1) Depending on the number of exemptions, one may be able to complete the program in 3 or 3.5 years, rather than four. 2) SMU’s curriculum is more holistic in that you don’t just take courses specific to your domain, but are able to take a second major to learn a complementary discipline (ie Accounting w/ second major in Finance or Finance w/ a second major in Economics, and there are so many other combinations as well). The core modules also address topics that are quite pertinent to self-improvement, which I think is beneficial.  3) SMU is a management school, and so you get a number of inherent advantages from studying Biz/Acc here. The emphasis on corporate skills, the professors, the school culture, and the proximity to the CBD all contribute to making students more effective management professionals.  4) SMU may not be known for the hostel experience, but the vibrancy of the CCAs more than makes up for it.  Ultimately, I believe the choice has to made by oneself. But I do think the preceding points could definitely aid in one’s research to see what best fits him or her.

You can graduate faster in 3 years and start working earlier, but 4 years lets you do more internships and take more modules. Up to individual preference. 2) The nbs second major is severely limited. It is almost impossible to do a non-traditional second major because you only have 3 years to graduate and very few units for electives. 3) Contrary to popular belief, nbs is not well-known outside Singapore at all , although the ntu brand does have some mileage in asia. 4) CCA is a moot point becauase all unis have CCAs. However, it is true that hall life may be an important consideration for some applicants. And lastly, SMU has way better career services because: - They are located in the city, it is easy to get companies to come down or to get students to attend talks - Because they are located in the city, it is also easy for their students to do part-time internships - They have a much stronger alumni network - Their career service office is much more pro-active than nbs The nbs career office always jokes about how smu students are only good at talking/presentation. But just look at linkedin for the career outcomes of NBS students compared to SMU students. The NBS guy will probably end up in Big4 while the SMU guy is in a bank. For the record, nbs graduate here. rabbit1 wrote:  Sorry but reasons like "career office located in city" is superior or SMU has a stronger alumni network without substantiation sounds stupid and don't hold too much water.

I really hope to get into NUS IS (I am interested in the modules offered) but no news till now so I am already prepared to face the worst scenario. I did receive an offer from SMU so I still got Plan B.  However, SMU school fees is higher than NUS by over 10k, which really makes me think whether should I take up SMU offer.  Personally, I like both SMU and NUS but school fees is really a factor that I must take into account of. Moreover, I do not have an extensive knowledge on how SMU IS curriculum. I wonder is it the same as NUS? or does it differ a lot?  So if NUS rejects me this year, I intend to reject SMU offer, and apply next year to NUS. The reason being university will no longer take into account of O Level result from Y2020 onwards. I was a PFP student and does not have an O Level result thus the long wait or possible rejection from NUS. So I would like to ask what are some of your thoughts on this?  1) Should I reject SMU this year and apply for NUS next year?  2) Do I stand a higher chance in getting accepted if I apply next year? (My CGPA is above 3.9)  Thank you everyone for reading this long post lol just wanna listen to some of your advices/opinions. Thanks! Hi! I'm in similar situation. I graduated in 2017, coming from relevant Diploma with Merit CGPA 3.95.  I'm a PFP student as well but I do not meet the maths requirement. Thus, I've been trying DA as I have good CCA records (I won several awards in local IT competitions, represented SG in international competition before, worked as freelance developer as well as startup biz as well). I got invited for DA in 2017, but didn't manage to secure a spot. Applied last year & was rejected without interview and this year is my last year of applying as I managed to disrupt from National Service (I enlisted late). I currently accepted NTU Computer Science. I'm thinking whether to take a gap year to take O Level Maths to increase my chance as well as from Y2020 onwards, O level will not be taken into consideration. However, due to my family circumstances as well as discouragement from friends I most likely will be enrolling into NTU meanwhile just praying for some good news from NUS side. Haha. Are you a male or female?  If you are a male serving NS, You can accept SMU offer first and reapply next year.  I wish you all the best and hope you will get news from NUS soon!",11.251169660017343

The culture is very cheena, so if you are not cheena, I strongly suggest NUS or SMU if not you will be like a fish out of water. In terms of career services, SMU is ahead. They usually get better placements, and students can do internships during the term due to the proximity of the school to CBD. They are way ahead of NUS and NTU in placing their students into good jobs. But school fees more expensive, and SMU doesn't have hall life (if you want to experience it). Also seems that the competition there is extremely fierce (class participation anyone?). But its in the city which also has some perks. Probably NTU if you just wanna grad quickly and be an auditor (although many also end up in management associate roles). SMU may be better if you are aiming for front office finance positions. actually for poly grads going uni & intend to go big4, better to go SIT. can become Associate 2 upon graduation and it is 2-3 years course. but if want big 3 then NTU because 3 years course.

I think the whole “3 vs 4 years” debate comes up every intake, and it’s easy to think linearly and say that NBS > SMU Biz/Acc. However, would like to point out that: 1) Depending on the number of exemptions, one may be able to complete the program in 3 or 3.5 years, rather than four. 2) SMU’s curriculum is more holistic in that you don’t just take courses specific to your domain, but are able to take a second major to learn a complementary discipline (ie Accounting w/ second major in Finance or Finance w/ a second major in Economics, and there are so many other combinations as well). The core modules also address topics that are quite pertinent to self-improvement, which I think is beneficial.  3) SMU is a management school, and so you get a number of inherent advantages from studying Biz/Acc here. The emphasis on corporate skills, the professors, the school culture, and the proximity to the CBD all contribute to making students more effective management professionals.  4) SMU may not be known for the hostel experience, but the vibrancy of the CCAs more than makes up for it.  Ultimately, I believe the choice has to made by oneself. But I do think the preceding points could definitely aid in one’s research to see what best fits him or her.

You can graduate faster in 3 years and start working earlier, but 4 years lets you do more internships and take more modules. Up to individual preference. 2) The nbs second major is severely limited. It is almost impossible to do a non-traditional second major because you only have 3 years to graduate and very few units for electives. 3) Contrary to popular belief, nbs is not well-known outside Singapore at all , although the ntu brand does have some mileage in asia. 4) CCA is a moot point becauase all unis have CCAs. However, it is true that hall life may be an important consideration for some applicants. And lastly, SMU has way better career services because: - They are located in the city, it is easy to get companies to come down or to get students to attend talks - Because they are located in the city, it is also easy for their students to do part-time internships - They have a much stronger alumni network - Their career service office is much more pro-active than nbs The nbs career office always jokes about how smu students are only good at talking/presentation. But just look at linkedin for the career outcomes of NBS students compared to SMU students. The NBS guy will probably end up in Big4 while the SMU guy is in a bank.

Please share your views on it as well. I really hope to get into NUS IS (I am interested in the modules offered) but no news till now so I am already prepared to face the worst scenario. I did receive an offer from SMU so I still got Plan B.  However, SMU school fees is higher than NUS by over 10k, which really makes me think whether should I take up SMU offer.  Personally, I like both SMU and NUS but school fees is really a factor that I must take into account of. Moreover, I do not have an extensive knowledge on how SMU IS curriculum. I wonder is it the same as NUS? or does it differ a lot?  So if NUS rejects me this year, I intend to reject SMU offer, and apply next year to NUS. The reason being university will no longer take into account of O Level result from Y2020 onwards. I was a PFP student and does not have an O Level result thus the long wait or possible rejection from NUS. So I would like to ask what are some of your thoughts on this?  1) Should I reject SMU this year and apply for NUS next year?  2) Do I stand a higher chance in getting accepted if I apply next year?

I graduated in 2017, coming from relevant Diploma with Merit CGPA 3.95.  I'm a PFP student as well but I do not meet the maths requirement. Thus, I've been trying DA as I have good CCA records (I won several awards in local IT competitions, represented SG in international competition before, worked as freelance developer as well as startup biz as well). I got invited for DA in 2017, but didn't manage to secure a spot. Applied last year & was rejected without interview and this year is my last year of applying as I managed to disrupt from National Service (I enlisted late). I currently accepted NTU Computer Science. I'm thinking whether to take a gap year to take O Level Maths to increase my chance as well as from Y2020 onwards, O level will not be taken into consideration. However, due to my family circumstances as well as discouragement from friends I most likely will be enrolling into NTU meanwhile just praying for some good news from NUS side. Haha. Are you a male or female?  If you are a male serving NS, You can accept SMU offer first and reapply next year.  I wish you all the best and hope you will get news from NUS soon!",11.251169660017343

Overall I am wondering which school is better to attend? What are the pros and cons for both schools? I'm not sure about NTU, but I can share some from my perspective as an SMU Accountancy student.Similarities1. Content: NTU and SMU accounting modules are similar according to my NTU Accountancy friends.  More or less the same, but the depth may vary according to the electives taken. 2. Seminar style: SMU has it for all classes. NTU has it, but I'm not sure.3. Exemptions: - For professional qualifications, for SMU, you can get 12 out of 15 exemptions (provided you pass the requisite papers) for ICAEW. - For NTU, I'm not sure, but I've a friend who took advanced tax and (i heard) is exempted from CA Singapore's Tax paper. (Need to confirm.)Differences1. Cost SMU = $11k per annum for 4 years = $44k NTU = $8k per annum for 3 years = $24k Yup the cost difference is quite large (assuming we don't factor in hostel fees).2. Exemptions - This is more applicable if you're a poly student. If your poly's CGPA is >= 3.8, you can get a maximum of 10+ exemptions from SMU. This means you can graduate in 3 years from SMU even without overloading modules. 3. Location - SMU is more accessible, unless you stay in the west then NTU is more accessible.4. Ability to SU modules! - SMU: Has the option to SU two elective modules only when you file for graduation.  - NTU: Can SU some electives according to their website. 5. Graduate starting pay Already mentioned by SiaoLengKeng earlier in this thread, the starting pay for big 4 for both NTU and SMU graduates are similar. $3,000+ for audit.6. Other misc requirements - SMU has a compulsory 80 hours community service requirement + 1x overseas trip requirement. Overall, if we compare just by cost alone, NTU would be better because it is more cost efficient, but if we consider other factors, then there's no uni that's "better".

But NTU have replied to offer an interview as well (same course). I am not sure if I should attend for the interview as I really like SMU but the tuition fee is really a huge burden. Overall I am wondering which school is better to attend? What are the pros and cons for both schools? I'm not sure about NTU, but I can share some from my perspective as an SMU Accountancy student.Similarities1. Content: NTU and SMU accounting modules are similar according to my NTU Accountancy friends.  More or less the same, but the depth may vary according to the electives taken. 2. Seminar style: SMU has it for all classes. NTU has it, but I'm not sure.3. Exemptions: - For professional qualifications, for SMU, you can get 12 out of 15 exemptions (provided you pass the requisite papers) for ICAEW. - For NTU, I'm not sure, but I've a friend who took advanced tax and (i heard) is exempted from CA Singapore's Tax paper. (Need to confirm.)Differences1. Cost SMU = $11k per annum for 4 years = $44k NTU = $8k per annum for 3 years = $24k Yup the cost difference is quite large (assuming we don't factor in hostel fees).2. Exemptions - This is more applicable if you're a poly student. If your poly's CGPA is >= 3.8, you can get a maximum of 10+ exemptions from SMU. This means you can graduate in 3 years from SMU even without overloading modules. 3. Location - SMU is more accessible, unless you stay in the west then NTU is more accessible.4. Ability to SU modules! - SMU: Has the option to SU two elective modules only when you file for graduation.  - NTU: Can SU some electives according to their website. 5. Graduate starting pay Already mentioned by SiaoLengKeng earlier in this thread, the starting pay for big 4 for both NTU and SMU graduates are similar. $3,000+ for audit.6. Other misc requirements - SMU has a compulsory 80 hours community service requirement + 1x overseas trip requirement. Overall, if we compare just by cost alone, NTU would be better because it is more cost efficient, but if we consider other factors, then there's no uni that's "better". It'll depend on your personal preference!",10.439614868718463

For NTU, unlike SMU SOSS or NUS FASS, we don't go through those introductory courses and you don't pick your specialization after  year 1. You directly get into your course in NTU and get modules specifically (i.e. psychology) based.  This is a one of the advantage of being in NTU whereas, i heard sometimes if you want a specific course (i.e. psych) , you have to "fight" for it. The more popular the course, the harder to get in. Oh, btw most poly graduates are exempted from several GERPEs. (Modules that you are required to take ranging from sciences, business, liberal arts, etc.)  2. You can look into sociology too? This degree is about the society and people. (You can DM me about sociology cause I'm in this course  )  3. You can always take a minor in ntu.",10.372231141645717

I believe NTU/NUS would be a better choice given your goals and aims in life! In ntu, besides taking the psych core mods, many NTU psych majors also take up NIE mods as their minors (such as in counselling, special needs, early childhood, youth pathopsychology, educational psychology and the list goes on HAHA) In nus, i believe there are social work modules that you can take either as a second major, minor or free electives (which seems to suit your passion of helping others!) I feel that SMU is more geared towards business and may not necessarily suits your future career aspirations (not because it's not as good but it doesn't seem in line with your goals) Also, maybe you can take into consideration the environment you work best in and maybe travelling time (because tbh, there shouldn't be that much diff between the 3 uni in terms of prestige- psychology in the 3 uni aren't ranked very highly in the world actually- most of my coursemates would love to enrol in overseas uni if they got the $$$)  also, I am not in the position to speak for poly students since Im from the JC route (so im not very sure ^^"; all I know is that NUS FASS cop is BBC/B and NTU psych cop is AAC/C to apply; I didnt apply to SMU psych- however, i heard it's based more on interviews rather than just your rp like for NTU/NUS? Im not very sure) Actually, you may also consider that NTU psych is a direct honours track, and direct honours is basically what it is; however, if you are not planning to take masters (in which having honours makes it easier to), you should save your money and just go NUS FASS (3 years if you cant/dont want to get honours) Hope this helps!

But NTU have replied to offer an interview as well (same course). I am not sure if I should attend for the interview as I really like SMU but the tuition fee is really a huge burden. Overall I am wondering which school is better to attend? What are the pros and cons for both schools? I'm not sure about NTU, but I can share some from my perspective as an SMU Accountancy student.Similarities1. Content: NTU and SMU accounting modules are similar according to my NTU Accountancy friends.  More or less the same, but the depth may vary according to the electives taken. 2. Seminar style: SMU has it for all classes. NTU has it, but I'm not sure.3. Exemptions: - For professional qualifications, for SMU, you can get 12 out of 15 exemptions (provided you pass the requisite papers) for ICAEW. - For NTU, I'm not sure, but I've a friend who took advanced tax and (i heard) is exempted from CA Singapore's Tax paper. (Need to confirm.)Differences1. Cost SMU = $11k per annum for 4 years = $44k NTU = $8k per annum for 3 years = $24k Yup the cost difference is quite large (assuming we don't factor in hostel fees).2. Exemptions - This is more applicable if you're a poly student. If your poly's CGPA is >= 3.8, you can get a maximum of 10+ exemptions from SMU. This means you can graduate in 3 years from SMU even without overloading modules. 3. Location - SMU is more accessible, unless you stay in the west then NTU is more accessible.4. Ability to SU modules! - SMU: Has the option to SU two elective modules only when you file for graduation.  - NTU: Can SU some electives according to their website. 5. Graduate starting pay Already mentioned by SiaoLengKeng earlier in this thread, the starting pay for big 4 for both NTU and SMU graduates are similar. $3,000+ for audit.6. Other misc requirements - SMU has a compulsory 80 hours community service requirement + 1x overseas trip requirement. Overall, if we compare just by cost alone, NTU would be better because it is more cost efficient, but if we consider other factors, then there's no uni that's "better". It'll depend on your personal preference!",10.439614868718463

For NTU, unlike SMU SOSS or NUS FASS, we don't go through those introductory courses and you don't pick your specialization after  year 1. You directly get into your course in NTU and get modules specifically (i.e. psychology) based.  This is a one of the advantage of being in NTU whereas, i heard sometimes if you want a specific course (i.e. psych) , you have to "fight" for it. The more popular the course, the harder to get in. Oh, btw most poly graduates are exempted from several GERPEs. (Modules that you are required to take ranging from sciences, business, liberal arts, etc.)  2. You can look into sociology too? This degree is about the society and people. (You can DM me about sociology cause I'm in this course  )  3. You can always take a minor in ntu.",10.372231141645717

I would really appreciate any feedbacks or suggestions from any point of view.  Thanks guys!    Hi, im currently a y1 psych student in NTU! I believe NTU/NUS would be a better choice given your goals and aims in life! In ntu, besides taking the psych core mods, many NTU psych majors also take up NIE mods as their minors (such as in counselling, special needs, early childhood, youth pathopsychology, educational psychology and the list goes on HAHA) In nus, i believe there are social work modules that you can take either as a second major, minor or free electives (which seems to suit your passion of helping others!) I feel that SMU is more geared towards business and may not necessarily suits your future career aspirations (not because it's not as good but it doesn't seem in line with your goals) Also, maybe you can take into consideration the environment you work best in and maybe travelling time (because tbh, there shouldn't be that much diff between the 3 uni in terms of prestige- psychology in the 3 uni aren't ranked very highly in the world actually- most of my coursemates would love to enrol in overseas uni if they got the $$$)  also, I am not in the position to speak for poly students since Im from the JC route (so im not very sure ^^"; all I know is that NUS FASS cop is BBC/B and NTU psych cop is AAC/C to apply; I didnt apply to SMU psych- however, i heard it's based more on interviews rather than just your rp like for NTU/NUS? Im not very sure) Actually, you may also consider that NTU psych is a direct honours track, and direct honours is basically what it is; however, if you are not planning to take masters (in which having honours makes it easier to), you should save your money and just go NUS FASS (3 years if you cant/dont want to get honours) Hope this helps!

This is my personal opinion but I think poly kids are able to cope better if they go to smu rather than NUS or NTU.   You will definitely get a shock when you enter ntu. You would have to put in effort from week 1 if you want to maintain your gpa. In my first sem, majority of my classmates are from mid tier to top jcs (anderson, hwachong, raffles, acjc and etc). Their rank points are about 85 to 90. As such it is VERY VERY difficult to compete with them. Not sure about SMU. FrostWurm wrote:  Graduated from NBS several years ago. The culture is very cheena, so if you are not cheena, I strongly suggest NUS or SMU if not you will be like a fish out of water. In terms of career services, SMU is ahead. They usually get better placements, and students can do internships during the term due to the proximity of the school to CBD. They are way ahead of NUS and NTU in placing their students into good jobs. But school fees more expensive, and SMU doesn't have hall life (if you want to experience it). Also seems that the competition there is extremely fierce (class participation anyone?). But its in the city which also has some perks. Probably NTU if you just wanna grad quickly and be an auditor (although many also end up in management associate roles). SMU may be better if you are aiming for front office finance positions. actually for poly grads going uni & intend to go big4, better to go SIT. can become Associate 2 upon graduation and it is 2-3 years course. but if want big 3 then NTU because 3 years course.

I think the whole “3 vs 4 years” debate comes up every intake, and it’s easy to think linearly and say that NBS > SMU Biz/Acc. However, would like to point out that: 1) Depending on the number of exemptions, one may be able to complete the program in 3 or 3.5 years, rather than four. 2) SMU’s curriculum is more holistic in that you don’t just take courses specific to your domain, but are able to take a second major to learn a complementary discipline (ie Accounting w/ second major in Finance or Finance w/ a second major in Economics, and there are so many other combinations as well). The core modules also address topics that are quite pertinent to self-improvement, which I think is beneficial.  3) SMU is a management school, and so you get a number of inherent advantages from studying Biz/Acc here. The emphasis on corporate skills, the professors, the school culture, and the proximity to the CBD all contribute to making students more effective management professionals.  4) SMU may not be known for the hostel experience, but the vibrancy of the CCAs more than makes up for it.  Ultimately, I believe the choice has to made by oneself. But I do think the preceding points could definitely aid in one’s research to see what best fits him or her.

You can graduate faster in 3 years and start working earlier, but 4 years lets you do more internships and take more modules. Up to individual preference. 2) The nbs second major is severely limited. It is almost impossible to do a non-traditional second major because you only have 3 years to graduate and very few units for electives. 3) Contrary to popular belief, nbs is not well-known outside Singapore at all , although the ntu brand does have some mileage in asia. 4) CCA is a moot point becauase all unis have CCAs. However, it is true that hall life may be an important consideration for some applicants. And lastly, SMU has way better career services because: - They are located in the city, it is easy to get companies to come down or to get students to attend talks - Because they are located in the city, it is also easy for their students to do part-time internships - They have a much stronger alumni network - Their career service office is much more pro-active than nbs The nbs career office always jokes about how smu students are only good at talking/presentation. But just look at linkedin for the career outcomes of NBS students compared to SMU students. The NBS guy will probably end up in Big4 while the SMU guy is in a bank.

I did receive an offer from SMU so I still got Plan B.  However, SMU school fees is higher than NUS by over 10k, which really makes me think whether should I take up SMU offer.  Personally, I like both SMU and NUS but school fees is really a factor that I must take into account of. Moreover, I do not have an extensive knowledge on how SMU IS curriculum. I wonder is it the same as NUS? or does it differ a lot?  So if NUS rejects me this year, I intend to reject SMU offer, and apply next year to NUS. The reason being university will no longer take into account of O Level result from Y2020 onwards. I was a PFP student and does not have an O Level result thus the long wait or possible rejection from NUS. So I would like to ask what are some of your thoughts on this?  1) Should I reject SMU this year and apply for NUS next year?  2) Do I stand a higher chance in getting accepted if I apply next year?

Applied last year & was rejected without interview and this year is my last year of applying as I managed to disrupt from National Service (I enlisted late).

I'm thinking whether to take a gap year to take O Level Maths to increase my chance as well as from Y2020 onwards, O level will not be taken into consideration.

Overall I am wondering which school is better to attend? What are the pros and cons for both schools? I'm not sure about NTU, but I can share some from my perspective as an SMU Accountancy student.Similarities1. Content: NTU and SMU accounting modules are similar according to my NTU Accountancy friends.  More or less the same, but the depth may vary according to the electives taken. 2. Seminar style: SMU has it for all classes. NTU has it, but I'm not sure.3. Exemptions: - For professional qualifications, for SMU, you can get 12 out of 15 exemptions (provided you pass the requisite papers) for ICAEW. - For NTU, I'm not sure, but I've a friend who took advanced tax and (i heard) is exempted from CA Singapore's Tax paper. (Need to confirm.)Differences1. Cost SMU = $11k per annum for 4 years = $44k NTU = $8k per annum for 3 years = $24k Yup the cost difference is quite large (assuming we don't factor in hostel fees).2. Exemptions - This is more applicable if you're a poly student. If your poly's CGPA is >= 3.8, you can get a maximum of 10+ exemptions from SMU. This means you can graduate in 3 years from SMU even without overloading modules. 3. Location - SMU is more accessible, unless you stay in the west then NTU is more accessible.4. Ability to SU modules! - SMU: Has the option to SU two elective modules only when you file for graduation.  - NTU: Can SU some electives according to their website. 5. Graduate starting pay Already mentioned by SiaoLengKeng earlier in this thread, the starting pay for big 4 for both NTU and SMU graduates are similar. $3,000+ for audit.6. Other misc requirements - SMU has a compulsory 80 hours community service requirement + 1x overseas trip requirement. Overall, if we compare just by cost alone, NTU would be better because it is more cost efficient, but if we consider other factors, then there's no uni that's "better". It'll depend on your personal preference!",10.439614868718463

I got 77.5rp, PCME. 1) take a gap year but do something that you can present to the uni as achievements. 2) do the international A levels and try to get all As 3) or do SATs and get a good score 4) apply to all 3 unis, and choose courses that are not that popular. (seriously you are an idiot to only apply to NTU). I STRONGLY RECOMMEND TRYING FOR SMU if you just want to get in somewhere. 5) If you really want to stay here, there are loads of other programmes. Singapore is an education hub. I don't know if you are a PR, but it may cost more if you are not. -SUSS (Recently have a couple of new undergrad programmes) -SIT (You can get a "branded" degree from the Technical University of Munich) -ESSEC business school (Somewhat well-known French biz school) -SIM-GE (UOL, UniOfBuffalo if you wanna go overseas) -James Cook/MDIS/Kaplan -Or just try the Big3 for one more year Plan wisely and good luck;",10.421976537600193

I grew fondly for social science (i.e. psychology) even though I am a poly student who studies accountancy and have a mixture of accounting and business knowledge. 2. I feel that I want to study with a deeper meaning and that it would benefit both society and myself. (I love to make people smile and be happy, thinking on the positive side) 3. I would not only just basically want to study on psychology, I want to expand my knowledge such as taking extra courses that would broaden my career prospects. The above facts are there to briefly describe what are my thoughts now because I do not want to regret choosing the wrong course in the end but still I'm planning to enter a local uni as of now. I would really appreciate any feedbacks or suggestions from any point of view.  Thanks guys! Hey there! I'm currently in NTU social sciences.  1. For NTU, unlike SMU SOSS or NUS FASS, we don't go through those introductory courses and you don't pick your specialization after  year 1. You directly get into your course in NTU and get modules specifically (i.e. psychology) based.  This is a one of the advantage of being in NTU whereas, i heard sometimes if you want a specific course (i.e. psych) , you have to "fight" for it. The more popular the course, the harder to get in. Oh, btw most poly graduates are exempted from several GERPEs. (Modules that you are required to take ranging from sciences, business, liberal arts, etc.)  2. You can look into sociology too? This degree is about the society and people. (You can DM me about sociology cause I'm in this course  )  3. You can always take a minor in ntu.",10.372231141645717

My current course choices are as stipulated below but I feel like I would much prefer doing Business than Socio and English, but Soci and English is a lot easier to get in.  However, I've read about some 3.3-3.4 kids getting into Business and was wondering if I should put it higher in my choices? But I know that might impact me getting a chance for Soci and English as well.  Poly final GPA: 3.49 Diploma: Mass comm O'Levels: A1 in English and AMath I am applying to NTU with these choices: 1. WKWSCI 2. Sociology 3. English 4. Business 5. Information Engineering and Media Appreciate any advice and thoughts! don't think you should call the 3.3-3.4 ppl kids. After all they must be your senior LOL I think you should stand some chance for sociology and english. So do put them as your top 2 choices.JJQQLL wrote:  Thanks for your reply. But my son’s RP can’t get into NUS CS.  At 78.75, does he stand a chance to get into CS in SMU? How about computer engineering in NUS? Thanks again. I don't think 78.75 applies to poly grads. maybe you wanna share the GPA that your son got from RP ?",7.926273658555782

My son got 78.75 points (as CS probably looks at math results, he got a A for H2 Math). Does he have a chance to get into CS in SMU? Or should he not waste his 1st choice and apply for information system in SMU? He definitely prefers CS. Thanks for your input. Not too sure how competitive it is to get into SMU CS, but definitely worth a try. I know that to get into NUS CS, its requires pretty much straight A now. so I don't think there are so many straight A students to fill all 3 uni.",6.227843861891377
