I personally feel that SMU places more empathise on personal development than grades. So if you can get an interview with GPA 3.7, I won't be surprised for IS. no doubt.

It is rare that a person actually looks at himself and think that maybe the fault lies with him.  If no foreigners are given a place, the cut-off GPA would be like 2.5? The quality of the universities would be dragged down. No one would need/want to study. A-level get EEE/E also can get in. In any case, foreigners only take up 18% of local university places. Now got so many uni places already that the IGP is dropping like crazy. In any case, the grades required for foreigners to get into local uni is usually quite high.

I took amaths and economics during my secondary and poly time respectively. I also applied for nus fass for the previous 2 years, but they rejected me too which i dunno why.  Could it be the reason that i am serving ns now? I kinda at a loss about what to do. I dont really wanna go SIM with my gpa! No! In fact, NS should be an advantage especially if you get into command school! (That is also considered a non-accademic achievement) Other awards like best soldier may help too! NS is the best time to talk about your experiences and what made you decide (forgive me if I sound too drama or cliche) on going into that dream course! NTU/NUS/SMU requires students to write more about themselves for the courses they require to get into/why and there is a portion for non-accademic achievements. Remember to fill that up! Don't think it is not important because there are many people with the same GPA as you, so how do they consider applicants? To see if they have any additional talents/achievements they can bring with them outside their GPA!!! I cannot stress this enough, especially if you are from a poly! Also, I feel you about not being able to get into a local university of my choice! I screwed up my admission to get into my several dream courses at various Local U's during the first year because I thought they only look at GPA, and hence I didn't really bother much with the interview/and did not fill my non-CCA achievements. I thought I would definitely secure a place butI was so FRIGGIN WRONG. I felt like I was going to die literally because I couldn't get into a Local U. It was awful because I worked so friggin hard in poly D': Fortunately, I managed to pull myself together and manage to not screw up the second time and got into a local U with a course of my choice  So, DONT GIVE UP BRO. Now that you are closer to ORD, find some time to improve yourself, hunt down your poly lecturer to write you that testimonial letter for your university admission as they will really help. You are a merit holder, I am sure you have worked hard for it and paid attention during leessons. Your lecturers 会给你面子 if you are sincere and ask nicely!   If all else fails, there is always a local university route outside of NTU/NUS and it can be even better than the two.. but I can't say here.. later people will think I am biased towards certain university...

NUS cannot choose their specialisation as what they wish, CAP is still a consideration. So far the only subject I have trouble understanding the lecturer is stats, most prof are Singaporean and speak rather well. Also, I survive 80% of my modules without the textbooks, notes are generally sufficient. Lastly, I have more NUS friends regretting not coming NBS instead.

I would like to share my personal experience on my first group interview/test in 2013 admissions. Back than, there was a huge volume being interviewed for the students who applied for the course, and I was put in a relatively bigger than average group. It was really competitive and at every point in time, there would be people fighting for airtime. Sad to say, I screwed up for my first interview as I didn't~ really create a first good impression. Based on what I hear from my other friends and personal experience, the first interview you have with SMU (E.G of a total of 15-20 students attending the group interview) only 2-5 will be deemed "good enough" to pass If you recall in 2013 admissions, there was one news article headline "7000 shortlisted students and SMU will interview them all". However, if you look at the placing offered for the 2013, only 1933 out of the 7000 students were lucky enough to gain entry. That means that 27.61% of the shortlisted candidates managed to pass the interview, and succeeded in vying a spot in SMU against their poly/JC peers So, no.

I think you shouldn't get too caught up with reputation right now, it is something that shouldn't take precedence over your interests and your desired career - mainly because it isn't as important as you think it is. I've a senior, an IP student from one of the top JCs who scored straight B's for his A levels did not get called for an interview for his 1st nor 2nd choice at SMU. Fella decided to go to SIM to pursue his studies in a similar field and is earning quite a lot working as a trader for a fund now.  There are a lot of ways you can monetize your degree - as long as you are doing what you want to do you will think of ways to do so. If you're going to do Jap studies but you're interested in Finance, then do take some finance mods if that is possible, join a finance CCA, take up CFA, participate in competitions, write a paper on Japan and show your employer that you are well versed with Jap culture and at the same time highly passionate (and active) in the finance side of things - you will be an amazing hire for a company looking to expand into / their operations in Japan.  It is important for us not to get caught up with the rankings. I cannot stress this enough - at the end of the day, it is who you are, what you've done and how you're working towards your goals that matter, not the reputation of your University.  Just to share: the decision for me was simple back then - I've sorted out my interests, understood what I needed to do... so I picked the one that's closest to where I live  And my parents are both members of KRGH so that made the choice even more obvious! Thanks for the great advice!  I am offered to do Linguistics in NTU, and it's a more attractive offer now especially since I am offered a scholarship there. The truth is, I love languages, and I'm obsessed with Japanese as well. Been learning the language since P5, over 9 years liao. Been exposed to the culture since I was born, so I am very influenced and in love with it. But still, I don't really see the point in doing Japanese Studies.  I am a Tourism/Business student in NP, so I have both business and hospitality backgrounds to fall upon. I am thinking of being a translator/interpreter, but doing Jap Studies would be pointless since I can't just concentrate on just one language. Being an Eng teacher in Japan would be nice as well, and that would require linguistics studies... The worst thing is, both degrees have one of the lowest starting salary among all the degrees, am now hesitating on whether to appeal to NBS instead... :/ cGPA: ard 3.82 O level: L1R5=4, L1R4=6",11.732312088005967

Hey! Congrats on being shortlisted for SMU SIS interview! First and foremost, you can find numerous blogs and forums with information about the interview. That aside, I've just went for the interview on 9th April and have just received an acceptance email today. So I will be actually telling you what to expect for the interview but it may differ. Firstly, it is a group interview which  consists of 2 interviewers (professors) and 6 interviewees including you. Upon arrival, you will be led to a room by current SIS student volunteers where they will brief you through the interview progress. You will then be given 15 minutes to complete a form whereby you have to state specific examples of certain characteristics and traits (eg. Leadership, curiosity etc). On the same form you have to list down 3 questions you wanna ask the professors. Another 15 minutes will be given to you to design (sketch on a black paper) a Web page depending on the case study. Once completed, you will be led to another room where the interviewers will already be seated. One by one, you have to present your design to everybody. Do expect some questions to be asked by the professors pertaining to your design.  Next comes the famous SMU estimation question and you have 4 minutes to write down your answer on a piece of paper. The question I received was, "How many A4 sized papers are used for exam questions in SMU per semester." They do not care about your final answer but are more concern on your thought process. So make realistic and sound assumptions before arriving to your final answer. The professors may ask the origin of your assumption. So make sure you know how to explain. Lastly, the interview will end of with a Q&A session whereby questions you have listed on earlier will be answered. Do not list down questions which can be easily found on SMU's website.  Be confident and show your passion towards IS while presenting your ideas. SMU SIS looks for students who are able to analyse problems fast with critical thinking skills. As long as you make an effort to prepare for the interview, you have won half of the battle. With that,  I wish you all the best for the interview",10.662897756711926

I submitted my first year's first term results too; I'm not sure if that would actually help with my application or that it would be more detrimental. It isn't that I'm not coping well academically but more of a personal issue, thus my decision to apply to Singapore.  What then would you say my chances are with an appeal? And also that apparently there is a 2nd window offer by SMU? How does that work? (Thanks for the reply) No offense, but your chances are zero. Grades are not up to par. And you chose small and relatively popular courses. Humanities/SS courses are gaining a following here. If you were inclined towards engineering, your chances would've been at least a little better, but I doubt you'd still get in with those grades, once again, no offense meant. That said, you can still appeal and try your luck. But don't get your hopes up. Not a 2nd window but more like just a second batch. Offers come in batches. Usually applicants get 2-3 offers between NUS/NTU/SMU/SUTD. So once a person confirms a place, it leaves the other unpicked place empty and then it is given to another applicant who is on the waiting list or to a person who appeals. There is no need to apply a second time.  If you are quite desperate to get into Singapore, the only chance would be to re-sit for the A-levels, or take the SAT. But once again, close to perfect grades will be required. Your first term results won't make much of a difference IMO, won't improve or be detrimental to the situation. The universities here are not too keen on transfers. Even between NUS/NTU/SMU themselves, transfers are very hard to come by. They'd rather a person applies as a new applicant and starts afresh. And because they are unable to look into the grading criteria of another institute, they are unable to completely judge a person by their term-by-term university results.",10.373858530168052

I've had this coming anyway and I know that the chances of getting in is close to zero. Just thought I could try anyway.  So for SMU, I'll have to wait until they send me some form of reply?

For NTU accountacny, your chances are very very slim. Your GPA is somewhat moderately-far away from their 10th Percentile at a difference of 0.1.  Your O level seem to be decent. But nevertheless, if it is your dream course and you have a strong interest for it , go and apply  . Just be sure to get more testimonial letters/recommendation letters/do some cca's etc. After all, 10th Percentile of 3.79 for NTU accountancy is just a guide, not an actual cut off For SMU Accountancy, your GPA is relatively close to the 10th percentile of 3.72, so you may be shortlisted (I would say 40-55% chance) for the interview. Just be sure to fill in the non-accademic portion and the short essay /3 CCA's you think are most important to you. Those are very important because SMU does not just look at grades solely. They want to see if you have the potential to be holistically successful and be an all rounder. Same for what I recommend as the NTU one. If you do get shortlisted, you must do well for the group interview/single person interview (For SMU accountancy, I've heard they do either one of this) or you still won't get accepted. Take note that, this is based off the Indicative Grade Profile (IGP) based on year 2013 for year 2014 admissions. The  IGP based on year 2014 for 2015 admissions will be out within a month and you may have to wait and see to determine what course of action you need to take.",9.310092147912924
