It's hard to believe that she only is just a 1991-er and so talented. She's already getting her bidadari bto 4-room  Well, perhaps so but I suppose the fact that she could go into Victoria JC already speaks for her credentials. Im actually quite curious, how is that impressive? Born 1991 JC girl would have grad in August 2014. She could have start work right after exams in May 2014. Bidadari is Nov 2015 BTO. Which gave her about 18 months to work before applying. Say she earns the median of 3k/month for communication grads. She herself could have earned enough for a 4-room Bidadari 10% downpayment in that time. Not even including the salary of her spouse.  As a comparison, an SMU fresh law grad can earns a median starting pay of 5.8k. IMO the JC you go to doesn't say anything about you at all once you get to university. You'll see top-JC people getting second or third class and you'll see poly people getting first class and dean's list.",8.223952336300226

Your words are harsh but reality is always harsh. It's just 1 month before uni starts. For people who are already planning for retaking A levels, those are good to go and not delusional. For those who want to take the easy way out with underpar results by appealing, reappealing, re-reappealing, re-re-reappealing, those are really delusional. You need psychiatric help for obsessive-compulsive disorder. You are sooo obsess with getting into uni that you solely focus on trying your very best to enter but oblivious to all other ways in life.  The very fact that you refuse to accept or believe you are not accepted shows that you are delusional. By the way, definition of delusion is ""out of touch with reality"". There are thousands of people out there retaking A levels every year to fight for it, I was one of them. Uni rejected me for 5 years straight. I only appealed, I did not even bother to reappeal since they said they already ""fully considered my appeal"". Get it straight and go retake your A levels, forget about your appeal. If successful, then good for you. You think by praying or hoping will help? What age are we living in, Stone Age? If you pray so much still cannot get in, then god had forsakened you.

I got As in GP, 4H2s and O level HCL, with B in PW. I have been considering applying for a science course in either NUS or NTU ,such as chemistry,pharmacy,life sciences etc.  1) Medicine? I ruled out medicine as I thought it's out of the question, as I didn't expect to get nearly straight As + my lack of good CCA records &consistent CIP. However, seeing my results, my mum asked me to try for medicine, saying that I might have chance of getting in. I could only apply to NUS since I didn't take the BMAT for NTU. The main question would be of course:whether I have a passion in serving as a doctor.  To be honest, I don't really have a clear idea. I enjoyed learning the various body systems and diseases in Sec 4 Bio but have never seriously considered to enter medicine. My interest in Bio is reduced in JC as we started learning micro things instead of the human body.  Qn: What do medicine students really study? Would it be back to Sec4 Bio kind of syllabus but of higher level? I joined Red Cross as a CCA in JC because I don't really have other choices and I was slightly interested in the various first aid equipment like which is used to treat what.

I got As in GP, 4H2s and O level HCL, with B in PW. I have been considering applying for a science course in either NUS or NTU ,such as chemistry,pharmacy,life sciences etc.  1) Medicine? I ruled out medicine as I thought it's out of the question, as I didn't expect to get nearly straight As + my lack of good CCA records &consistent CIP. However, seeing my results, my mum asked me to try for medicine, saying that I might have chance of getting in. I could only apply to NUS since I didn't take the BMAT for NTU. The main question would be of course:whether I have a passion in serving as a doctor.  To be honest, I don't really have a clear idea. I enjoyed learning the various body systems and diseases in Sec 4 Bio but have never seriously considered to enter medicine. My interest in Bio is reduced in JC as we started learning micro things instead of the human body.  Qn: What do medicine students really study? Would it be back to Sec4 Bio kind of syllabus but of higher level? I joined Red Cross as a CCA in JC because I don't really have other choices and I was slightly interested in the various first aid equipment like which is used to treat what.

One thing interesting about NTU is that all students are supposed to take unrestricted electives from other schools within NTU which you can choose and apply for. So you can also take electives on philosophy if that is one of your interests.  Anyway all the best for fass. Miracles can still happen as we read of a girl who got in with just 71plus rp last year.

May I know roughly how many places are offered for allied health courses? I was rejected by SIT this week, I am not even on the waitlist. I wonder is it worth for me to appeal if the intake for DR is very low. I cant find any information online.dontgiveup wrote:  Hi ! ~  I just wanna say good job to those who completed the interview for SIT allied health whether or not you have succeeded in being accepted.  For those whom will be attending the upcoming Tea Session, you will actually find out that how lucky u r to get it cos the numbers arent exactly very large (particularly RT cos the intake is only about 18 students).  Those who got shortlisted for interview is already considered very good. Because majority of the students would have gotten rejected from the start. And from the interview itself only about 1-2/8 students will get accepted.  So dont feel too upset about it as well.  To those who plans to try again, GO FOR IT! But do prepare your portfolio in the 1 year apart. Because once u have been shortlisted for interview, results and all no longer matters. It is merely about who u r ... interviewers have 0 knowledge or background on u , it is just how u r reacting. It is normal to fail one or two stations, but more importantly is not letting it affect you.  After all , if u want to be an Allied Health professional u have to strong mentally.  The interview gives u a glimpse of school life. In SIT we go by Trimesters, so this mean to say it is definitely more stressful. U will need to write at least an essay per trimester , so be prepared.  Even for those who got accepted, the tip is just PLAY WHILE U CAN NOW.  Just to share a personal story for those who didnt got in :  2017 was the first year this course started , to be honest i found out the minimum GPA for that year from friends who got in ... it was at least 3.7 just for interview.  I attempted as well (i wanted medicine), but i didnt even got shortlisted.  Yes, it is sad to be rejected ( in fact i applied to NTU, NUS and SIT i got rejected for all of them). But what is more important is , what u plan to do.  Getting sad is inevitable , but it doesnt get u anywhere. Why not let it be ur motivation ? Go for shadowing programmes- see if u r really in for it (we have ppl who realised it isnt their thing after getting in). Volunteer - Gain some experience and show them healthcare is for you.  Lastly, for me ... it was hard but as a poly grad i had issues finding jobs even. Eventually, i lowered myself and worked as a hospital patient assistant for a year. No doubt, it was difficult but at the end of it i do learn something.  I made use of my time in the healthcare setting understanding more on it, being look down is common but it makes u a better healthcare professional when u have experience what it is like to be the one being looked down before u become the one ordering people ard.  Eventually i got in and it was a miracle.  So it is not impossible to get in again but of course success is yours only if u have worked hard for it.  So, dont give up if it is really what u want.

I admire your courage, determination as well as your desire for medicine. That's something we should all learn from.

Most of us here on the forum (I assume) have been slapped ruthlessly by reality countless of times, hence we are here to advice you against being slapped from reality. Miracles really do not happen in life. Yes, I believe you that hard work and dedication can bring you to far and amazing places. But you asked us to rate your chance for medicine, and we can all say that it's impossible just based off your poly results alone. We are no one to judge your academic performance in poly, but you do admit it's not up to par with the requirement needed for medicine, right? You really need to recognise that first, that using your poly results and even your O's will NOT get you into medicine. Like you said, hard work and dedication can bring you to your destination, but not this avenue... Maybe if you redo poly, or take A levels as a private candidate, or take BMAT and go overseas med... these are other avenues that you can consider. I really admire your positive outlook, as I was once in your position (not for medicine but for another course). I was told ""delusional"", ""silly"", ""stupid"" by many others. And obviously, my application to my desired uni course failed. That was when I received a huge slap from reality (and had to go through the pain of retaking A levels. etc). And I am sure you do not want this to come. Still, I wish you all the best in your future endeavours. With your never-say-die attitude, I'm sure you can go far in life, really. (-: Ignore the haters, but keep in mind those who are genuinely concerned for you and give you warnings and tips along your journey. All the best! If his GPA was 3.7+ range, I would tell him the chances are very slim but if he had achievements relevant to his course of study (hospital attachments etc.), that may help him. 2.5 GPA is abysmal. People with 3.4 GPA are fighting to get into ""low demand"" courses like NTU English and this guy with a 2.5 GPA thinks he can get into the most in demand course in Singapore? As I mentioned, I myself fugged up my O levels but if I had asked people to rate my chances of entering RJC with 33 points, do you think people would have said ""there's a chance?"" Hell no. They would have laughed, told me to go into ITE instead. This scenario is similar to his situation. NUS medicine is RJC and he pretty much has 33 points and trying to enter RJC. What am I supposed to say? If he truly wanted to enter, there are alternatives. I have made it clear along with others. If die-die want to enter NUS medicine, prepare to slog hard for A levels.",11.990113039593759

Totally agree with you that scholarship should not be awarded based on academic performance only, which I did mention in my earlier post. The primary objective of my earlier post aims to encourage individuals who are currently applying/appealing for admission and/or scholarship - through the sharing of my education journey and the challenges experienced as an individual with a disadvantaged background. Subsequently, the post also seeks to highlight the flaws in the basis of selection for the scholarship interview. Today, institutions are still using a uniform assessment method to evaluate people of diverse backgrounds. The assessment for academic potential is pretty straightforward - cGPA, awards, and other academic achievement obtained from other sources (e.g. competitions, courses, etc.). The tricky part lies in the assessment of non-academic components - institutions seek individuals with certain attributes, qualities, and skills (e.g. leadership, teamwork, entrepreneurship, integrity, sports achievement, etc.). And often, institutions only consider school-related activities and/or co-curricular activities as the samples for their assessment.  On a personal note, I believed that those attributes, qualities, and skillscould also beidentified and assessed through employment experience (e.g. customers' testimonials, appraisals by superiors, awards attained, etc.).  In general, institutions should also look beyond the school-related activities and co-curricular activities when assessing the non-academic components of individuals. Hence, granting more flexibility for underprivileged students whose non-academic profile were considered as ""insubstantial"" and thereby allowing  them to have the opportunity to share their stories. Ultimately, an interview is all we need.P.s. I'm glad that your hard work paid off, and congrats on securing that scholarship offered by a private company  (I missed the application deadline for private & government scholarship ) To be shortlisted for interview on the government scholarship with 3.5GPA, you must have some really outstanding non-academic achievements! Do you mind to share with us? And hello senior , assuming you are an SMU student (based on the GPA capped at 4.0). As an individual with similar experience, juggling between full-time work and study is really no joke, not to mention that you are doing it at the University-level and still managed to scored a decent grade. Mind to share what full-time job you work as? Do you study in the day, and work at night/after-school hours? Did you, perhaps, packed all modules into that few days so that you could work for the rest of the days in the week? Sincerely hope that you can share some tips with us/me Networking/cloud computing consultant. And if you can get some really well-known individual in the industry to write recommendation letter would really be helpful.  I think due to my competition award as well as the system I build for one of the major hospital which became part of the national healthcare system.

Noting NUS graduates' good job prospects, Prof Ho also announced that NUS will be increasing the number of double majors to increase career options for its graduates. ""The nature of work is changing very rapidly, and we need to prepare students for a lifetime of diverse careers,"" he said. He said NUS, which currently offers 94 double major and major-minor combinations, will add another 86 such programmes. ""Someone doing data science and entrepreneurship, for example, can go and work for a range of industries in data science, and also go and do a start-up."" On top of the double majors, NUS also offers 71 double degrees, 33 joint degrees with partner universities and 24 concurrent degrees. Adding all this, currently 15 per cent of NUS students are trained in more than one discipline. Prof Ho said he hopes half of all NUS students will graduate with knowledge and skills in two different fields, so they will have more job offers to choose from. He also announced two new degree programmes for this year, one in pharmaceutical science and the other in veterinary science.

My RP is 75 raw, while it is a 76.5 with HCL O levels counted. I applied for business for NUS, NTU and SMU, and got offered NTU first in mid-April, and it was a direct offer. Got called up for SMU business interview which I went in mid-April, and got offered 2 days later. My NUS offer came the last, 2 weeks later after I was offered SMU, and I was about to lose hope when the offer came in! It has been such a tough ride, but I'm glad I chose to retake as it has given me so much more options, and most importantly, I got into the course that I truly want (after exploring for one more year).

Singapore was briefly the country with the second most infections and  its early exposure to the disease led it up the steep learning curve  ahead of others. The brutal experience with Sars - severe acute  respiratory syndrome - in 2003 has prepared Singapore well for the  coronavirus, and it has since drawn praise from the World Health  Organisation and international experts for its effective containment  measures.  However, it would be premature and indeed foolish to celebrate, given that the coronavirus continues to lob curveballs at us.  As it is also highly contagious, containing this insidious pathogen  involves everyone and this is why effective communication is especially  vital.  Even in the span of weeks, Singapore's brush with it has been  intense, enabling it to distil crucial lessons in what has worked,  floundered or faltered in communicating during a crisis.  I identify here five lessons.  #### 1. Transparency amid turmoil  The coronavirus first reared its head in Singapore in late January to  massive confusion. There was grave uncertainty on whether it would be  as deadly as Sars. Data from China was alarming yet inconclusive, and  worse, headlines and images from Wuhan on the rising fatality rate and  high profile deaths of several doctors heightened fears. It was in such  chaotic circumstances that the Singapore Government had to exert control  and assert authority.  Its  response was one of transparency. Singapore convened regular high-level  press conferences involving its multi-ministerial task force, with  leaders giving unambiguous information about the measures being taken.  This included quarantining contacts of those infected, imposing travel  bans and advisories, testing and treating cases, and implementing  healthcare-related precautions. Channels were set up to provide the  public with reliable and timely information to counter fake news.  The transparency and regularity with which information was provided,  including hard data on the number and profile of cases and their mutual  connections, offered welcome clarity amid a fog of doubt.  #### 2. Consistency trumps confusion  Despite these efforts, confusion reigned because of the lack of clear  information on the disease. One salient point of contention was whether  to mask or not to mask.  Footage from China depicted people donning masks, as if to suggest  that masks are vital protection. In Singapore's initial weeks of  reckoning with the coronavirus, people were increasingly seen wearing  masks on trains and in crowded areas.  >**We must avoid becoming  cavalier about the disease, especially given the concern over imported  cases sparking a second wave of infections here. The fight with the  coronavirus is predicted to be long-drawn.**  However, as health experts advised, masks have limited use in  preventing infection in casual contact and pales in comparison to the  mundane practice of hand-washing. With people in Singapore beginning to  stockpile masks, setting the record straight to ensure a healthy supply  of masks for healthcare workers was critical.  To arrest this trend, consistency of messaging was key, not just in  words but also in deeds. So political leaders were never seen wearing  masks in public engagements. This was in sharp contrast to Hong Kong or  South Korea, where Chief Executive Carrie Lam and President Moon Jae-in  were often pictured with masks on.  With all-round reinforcement of the message that masking up was  neither necessary nor useful, the wearing and hoarding of masks tapered  off. Consistency of messaging thus trumped confusion.  #### 3. Partnership with community  As the coronavirus knows no geographical, cultural or demographic  boundaries, Singapore's collective resistance is only as strong as its  weakest link.  Hence, top-down communication alone cannot effectively reach  everyone. A groundswell of supportive voices rose, including celebrity  blogger Mr Brown's Kim Huat Takes The Bus videos, artist Weiman Kow's  appealing infocomics on the virus and other community initiatives that  organically emerged to strengthen the chorus around socially responsible  behaviour.  A slew of community efforts also sprung up, such as #braveheartsg  that supports front-line medical staff and Better.sg that connects  people with extra masks and sanitisers to those in need, demonstrating  the importance of partnership with the community to bring everyone on  board the fight against the virus.  #### 4. Reassurance over condescension  We cannot underestimate the adverse psychological impact of a threat  such as Covid-19 that seems simultaneously immediate, yet remote. People  feel beleaguered and desperate to protect themselves and their loved  ones, and to achieve some semblance of control over this amorphous  hazard. To ensure that public messaging hits home, an empathetic stance  that does not dismiss people's fears but acknowledges their concerns  will more greatly resonate.  Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong's two national addresses on the  coronavirus have been commendable in this regard: authoritative yet  reassuring.  Notably, the mixed response to the leaked audio of Trade and Industry  Minister Chan Chun Sing's closed-door discussion at the Singapore  Chinese Chamber of Commerce and Industry suggests that old-fashioned  common sense delivered with candour may appeal to some, but grate on  others. It is safe to say that reassurance ultimately prevails over  condescension.  #### 5. Normalcy without complacency  The final and perhaps most difficult lesson to fully grasp is how  Singapore must now build a sense of normalcy without falling prey to  complacency.  The Republic has so far managed to contain the virus to some extent  without needing to lock down the city. People have mostly gone about  business as usual, albeit with minor inconveniences such as contact  tracing measures and workplace adaptations.  However, we must avoid becoming cavalier about the disease,  especially given the concern over imported cases sparking a second wave  of infections here. The fight with the coronavirus is predicted to be  long-drawn. Even as cases stabilise in China, where the virus initiated,  infections are now rising into the thousands in Europe, the new  epicentre of the pandemic. Should cases be imported to spark a rise in  community transmissions here, we may need to consider stricter  procedures as well.  This means we must steadfastly accept that managing this disease is  part of our lived reality, proceed with life as normal, but not let up  in taking the necessary safeguards.  Inevitably, people do experience campaign fatigue over time, so  strategies must be developed to maintain awareness about the coronavirus  and refresh public messaging at appropriate intervals. This may be  achieved through crafting novel slogans, recruiting new spokesmen or  experimenting with alternative communication platforms.  Attaining normalcy without breeding complacency will be a formidable challenge, but one Singapore must strive to achieve.  In the ongoing bid to stamp out the coronavirus, we have also had to  combat fake news and herd mentality such as panic buying. While we have  yet to decisively win these battles, we can nevertheless draw valuable  insights to sharpen our communication and messaging, so as to inoculate  everyone against disease, distortions and disinformation.  **• Lim Sun Sun is professor of communication and technology  and head of humanities, arts and social sciences at the Singapore  University of Technology and Design.

In terms of monitoring, we may be ahead but it really has been an equal bag of both hits and misses.  However, businesses are still trying to stay operational as much as possible.  One thing to note is that Singapore is a very tiny place and also extremely densely populated. Life still has to go on.     As of today 20th March 2020, we have 40 new cases.  The total number cases, cumulatively, in Singapore is 385  Out of that total of 385, the total discharged is 131 (infection free).   The total remaining in Hospital, is 254.    Of the 40 new cases, 30 are imported cases with travel history to Europe, N.America, ASEAN, other parts of Asia, 7 are linked to previous cases, 3 are currently unlinked  Of the 254 cases remaining in Hospital, 16 in ICU.  All Events with 250 or more participants are suspended till 30 Jun.   Public venues such as F&B, entertainment are trying their best to ensure 1 meter gaps among between customers and patrons.   There were some loopholes here and there. For example, during the 17th of March 2020,there was a flood of migrant workers crossing the border without facing a mandatory 14 day Stay-Home-Notice. That loophole has since been closed.  But for quite sometime before that, measures at the border with Malaysia were not what I myself considered to be adequate. To me personally, it was alarming because it was one of the busiest border crossings in the world, with over 300,000 Malaysian workers crossing that border on a daily basis, which continued till the total border shutdown and closure on 18th March 2020.  The government also came up with an app today to implement contact tracing: https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid19-trace-together-mobile-app-contact-tracing-coronavirus-12560616  In terms of mask supply, it is not so good.  3M does have a small factory in Singapore producing the N95 respiratory mask but nearly all surgical masks are imported from outside the country and given the current global situation, they have become a rare good.  One of our GLC (government linked corporation) actually has a mask production line in Taiwan but since the Taiwanese government had banned the export of masks from Taiwan, the authorities are looking to move that production line back to Singapore. But there had hardly been any news on that and I personally suspect the Taiwanese government may be blocking the removal of the production line.",11.978601419240844

If you flood the market with currency while people aren't working due to shutdowns, there'll be supply-side inflation. That can quickly lead to stagflation if one isn't careful, which might make things even worse as hospitals can no longer afford medication and people can no longer afford food.   The shutdowns in the US and EU work in the short term, and are an attempt to bring the scale of their local epidemics back to controllable levels. If it works, they can then attempt to do what singapore and South Korea are doing, and use widespread testing to keep the spread under control. This is what the government is suggesting in Singapore too, but the growth has not triggered more measures, yet: https://www.pmo.gov.sg/Newsroom/PM-Lee-remarks-COVID-19-Outbreak-12-Mar-2020   >Besides medical plans, if there is a spike, we will also need additional social distancing measures. These will be temporary like suspending school, staggering work hours, or compulsory telecommuting. They will be extra “brakes”, to be implemented when we see a spike in cases. The extra brakes will slow down transmission of the virus, prevent our healthcare system from being overwhelmed, and help bring the numbers back down. After the situation improves, we can ease off and go back to the baseline precautions.  This is a very scientific way to deal with it, and I'm quite impressed that the government came up with this plan before the recent Imperial University study suggested it: https://www.imperial.ac.uk/mrc-global-infectious-disease-analysis/news--wuhan-coronavirus/  (see Fig. 4 of report 9)  Essentially, because this virus has spread everywhere, there's going to be an international virus reservoir independent of what singapore does. Thus, it's unrealistic to expect that we can get rid of the virus in one fell swoop and we'd be ok from then on. We have to use measures that are sustainable, and use more draconian and less sustainable measures sparingly but as needed to ensure ICU units remain under-capacity.",11.759476388502499

Just remember than over 90% of the cases reported in the last 5 days are imported rather than community spread. So if other countries do not control situation in their geographies, no matter how long SG closes its borders, cases will jump up again as they open.   An extreme (maybe theoretical) option is to quarantine the world for 14 days (again I understand the implementation difficulty in this, but is just a hypothetical statement). Which basically means all countries make it mandatory to close all public places, shops, malls, work place (except working from home) etc. with only critical services (medical, police, emergency services) working (ensure separate teams who do not mingle with any other team during this period e.g. Medical Team A works with only team A for the period). **We just need 14 days of no new infection to lower the total number of active cases, and end this pandemic**. Yes, there will be a monumental economical impact, but possibly the pain will be lower than months of pain as countries pass this virus to one another, closing their borders at different point in time.  From a practical perspective it is extremely difficult, nearly impossible, but even if we achieve 60-80% success, that is a lot lower number of cases, and we can lower the upper end of infectious cases drastically, which will ease the pressure on healthcare infra of a country. For those who are still ill after the 14 day period can be quarantined further till no new infections found, and it will give government a starting position again to control the numbers in case they see cluster coming up again.  This of course will need proper planning - maybe giving people a couple of weeks to stock up (panic control measures in place), and prepare themselves for isolation. Also, even if 70-80% of the countries participate in this initiatives, they can boycott the remaining 20% till the time the country steps up efforts to control the epidemic in their country. Again hypothetical, but a great way to put breaks on the rising cases.",11.217637590789225

I'm pretty sure school closures are not out of the question, and I've never really heard that argument you're saying. [LHL says](https://www.pmo.gov.sg/Newsroom/PM-Lee-remarks-COVID-19-Outbreak-12-Mar-2020): >Besides medical plans, if there is a spike, we will also need additional social distancing measures.

The extra brakes will slow down transmission of the virus, prevent our healthcare system from being overwhelmed, and help bring the numbers back down. After the situation improves, we can ease off and go back to the baseline precautions.  So I think if clusters develop in schools, school would be suspended.  Regarding the specifics:  1. Makes sense, as transmission is more likely when symptomatic. Viruses aren't magic dust; whether you get infected depends on how many virus particles (the inocula size) you come into contact with. 2. Kinda silly. Maybe it helps, but idk. 3. Probably a balance between afternoon temperatures being too crazy and reducing air-con usage. Once again, it's not necessarily to halt spread, it's to limit it, and spending less time in air-con reduces risk due to the same reason I mentioned in 1. It's really _not_ all or nothing. 4. lmao 5. Theoretically a good measure, but teachers should enforce more. 6. This seems like a good measure. 7. Seems fine too 8. Really sounds like it's not a COVID measure.

I don't want to sound alarmist, but despite [NEA](https://www.nea.gov.sg/our-services/public-cleanliness/environmental-cleaning-guidelines/guidelines/interim-list-of-household-products-and-active-ingredients-for-disinfection-of-covid-19) specifications, there are also [doubts](http://theconversation.com/coronavirus-not-all-hand-sanitisers-work-against-it-heres-what-you-should-use-133277) about Benzalkonium chloride efficacy against SARS-CoV-1/2 virus. Note that the citation NEA provided was from 1988, against a coronavirus in dog. It is generally regarded as ""better than nothing"" but 70% alcohol-based are still preferred for hand sanitisers.  That is not to say that 0.5% BAC are useless, [this paper,](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0195670105000447?via%3Dihub#section0075) for eg, showed effectiveness against SARS-CoV-1, but note the contact time of 30 minutes. So perhaps don't use this and then immediately pick your nose or something.  So, what alternative hand sanitisers that work with short contact time and does not require alcohol. Soap and water still work, that's a start. Sodium hypochlorite or bleach, with the proper dilution, will also work. 0.05 - 0.1% sodium hypochlorite, or 1:100 - 1:50 bleach dilution. SARS-CoV-1 (2003) seems to be [inactivated within 5 minutes of contact time](https://academic.oup.com/cid/article-lookup/doi/10.1086/433186) with 0.05% sodium hypochlorite. A small issue with this type of disinfectant is the short shelf-life. 0.05% solution need to be made fresh everyday. A typical method in [Ebola prevention](https://www.cdc.gov/vhf/ebola/clinicians/non-us-healthcare-settings/chlorine-use.html) is to make a small batch of 1:10 dilution (0.5%) for surface disinfection, to be made fresh every 5 days, then dilute the 1:10 solution further 5-10 times for hand washing, which is to be made fresh everyday. Another problem is frequently use of 0.05% sodium hypochlorite is quite harsh on your skin and can lead to eczema and skin cracking. I combat this by liberal use of lotion and only use 0.05% sodium hypochlorite every third day or so, to lengthen the supply of ethanol-based hand sanitiser.",10.541302660730986

Without the government’s foresight and the implementation of many policies, we definitely would have been in a worse place. Many of these things can only be done at the National and international level. They definitely deserve the credit.   And also my great appreciation to the people in healthcare, regardless of Covid frontline, normal ward nurse or even GP clinic doctor or admin nurse. Everyone has a part to play to keep the system afloat so that it doesn’t spill over to the others and overload them. Not forgetting the allied health people, those in the labs who probably have painstaking done over tens to hundreds of thousands of rest by now. And the researchers and those administrators at MOH for doing their part too.   The SPF should take some credit for their efforts in contact tracing too, the effort gone into tracing thousands of people definitely isn’t easy. and the SCDF too, every time i see an ambulance nearby, i see the guys decked out in the full DORSCON Orange PPE, it must be hard to wear that for the whole day. And our boys in green should get some too for helping out in some of the back end saikang (they were the ones who packed the four masks for every freaking household)  You see, getting through this virus outbreak, it’s not just you, or me, or the Aunty coughing in the mrt but luckily wearing mask. It really is the combined effort of so many groups of people doing what they do best. What we really need is for everyone to step up and play their part (or really, just not be an asshole if you can’t contribute anything, cue the teenagers spitting or the drinking unpaid drinks video). And to coordinate all these, your government must be good enough to know what they’re doing. Looking around, not many governments are worthy of this compliment.

How many people directly go to hospital and get admitted, versus the number of people who went to gp/poly on the same day then sent to hospital? Please give me the count.  There are averaging 10 cases per day. They arrive at all the hospitals across SG. That's average one per day at each A&E. You're quite likely to be near one confirmed case if you have symptoms and go A&E any day. Compared to PHPC where there are thousands of clinics.   What's wrong with potential covid patients hanging around A&E? A&E is like the front door of the hospital, where else are they going to get admitted? Certainly not the specialist clinics.  All hospitals already have separate outdoor triage area since weeks back, where a fully gowned up staff will take your temperature, history, check for respiratory symptoms etc and then separate you away from other normal patients. In a sense this is a split A&E.   Until your test results come back, all potential patients might get grouped together as the patient load increases. The further along the epidemic, the more crowded the hospitals, the less you will get isolated. At some point, run out of isolation ward, just throw all into the same ward, if all of you have covid, no need to isolate from each other anyway.   This is why, if you're not That sick, don't go hospital. Go gp. Stay home and recover, until your symptoms so jialat that you need hospitalization. Since 80% of ppl don't need hospitalization.   If clinic gp thinks you need to go hospital, they will call an ambulance, you wait and get ferried to hospital. And ambulance drops you off at A&E right? But at least now the gp will tell the ambulance crew what is wrong with you, and the ambulance crew will tell the hospital staff. This is in a professional medical manner, not just random ownself diagnose.   What did China do? They had dedicated hospitals that only take covid. Because their healthcare infra is structured differently. What did SG do? Mostly sent to NCID, and all major hospitals have isolation wards, full A&E, training etc. Don't go to a shitty private hospital that has no resources to handle covid, you'll just get bumped to a public hospital.   Anyway it is in the hospital interest that confirmed cases don't spread around. More transmission means much more work for them especially.   The more important issue to worry about are employers who have their staff work with symptoms and foreigners who come here with symptoms.",9.869954591364898

I'm not saying we should not give a fuck, I'm saying that if collectively, we do the basics such as practicing proper hygiene, sneeze inside your elbows, wash hands frequently, we would reduce the risk enough.
