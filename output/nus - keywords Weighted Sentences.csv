First off is a written test in some meeting room. There were 11 others with me as well. So we were given a passage and 2 5-marks questions, with 30 minutes to complete the test. I would suggest you manage the time well, 10 min for reading, 10 min for each question. I don't think they'll be using the same passage, perhaps you can tell me your topic after your interview.  My passage was an extract from this rather 'ancient' philosopher's book. About 1.5 pages long with word size of probably 10. The 2 questions are based on the passage, somewhat like GP's comprehension; 1 question asking about the explanation of the content , the other asking for summary of arguments made by the author. I did manage to see how much my peers wrote, and to my horror, many of them wrote at least 1 page for each question. I just answered straight to the point with as much detailed and concise elaborations (probably barely half a page). So if you have the same worry as me, just remember that quality can definitely make up for quantity. At least I know that if I had written 1 page long, my answer will probably be worse off >.< No time for flowery language honestly. Second part was the actual interview by professors. It's a 1-1 interview in the prof's office. As there were 12 of us with 3 profs, they split us up into 3 groups. Most probably in alphabetical order. My name starts with 'A', so I was interviewed first in my group. 3 interviews were carried out simultaneously in various offices. There isn't a time limit per se, so I guess you could ramble on for as long as you prefer. During the interview, my interviewer ran through the process with me first. 3 main questions. 1. Something more academic, based on the written test. So it was like a chance to elaborate on what you've missed out, or for you to clarify on certain thoughts. No hard and fast rule with this. 2. Based on philosophy's fields of study, talk about what interests you in Philo. (It's basically why you chose Philosophy).  3. Elaborate on CCAs, what made you who you are, what changed your beliefs, any turning points in life etc (that kind of questions). Do take note though, the interviewer may refer (many times) to your application, be it choice of courses, CCA, results and what you wrote for discretionary etc. As for my interviewer, it seemed like he took a good look at the hardcopy of my application. Thank goodness I remembered the details of it.  Also, he actually made it very obvious that he's jotting down pointers of what you say from first question onwards, and he will write things that impresses him as you speak. So feel free to share your glorious history with your interviewer (of course it has to have some link with his main questions). Lastly, the interviewer will ask you if you have any queries. Ask something sensible and pertaining to philosophy or the school's pedagogy. You can PM me if you want to know what I asked. The interview process was a rather enjoyable one, semi-formal? We had a nice chat on some aspects of philosophy that I was interested in; and there's really nothing wrong if you're not sure on how to answer the questions. Just make a deliberate pause, at least to look like you're thinking through your answer, and do answer as logically as possible. Fact is, philosophy is based on logic.  Some tips for preparations: 1. Look up some of the famous philosophers and their background. You might kena one of them for your passage. 2. Look through the curriculum, and decide what you're interested in. Wiki is your best friend if you need explanations on the concepts. 3. Be honest with your background, but speak smartly and emphasize on your strengths. They just want to know you better. Best of luck for your interview tomorrow. PM me if you need anything else. Don't worry, the profs are really friendly. I heard much laughter coming from the other 2 rooms while I was in the interview. Hi! The written test was really challenging, it was about Rene. Everything was as expected for the interview portion, thank you so much for your help! I am not sure if I will be able to get in but thanks once again.",13.752187641782706

Cheeyarn, you may wish to take note of the above point^. This reason may prove to be true for some NTU courses.

I took amaths and economics during my secondary and poly time respectively. I also applied for nus fass for the previous 2 years, but they rejected me too which i dunno why.  Could it be the reason that i am serving ns now? I kinda at a loss about what to do. I dont really wanna go SIM with my gpa! No! In fact, NS should be an advantage especially if you get into command school! (That is also considered a non-accademic achievement) Other awards like best soldier may help too! NS is the best time to talk about your experiences and what made you decide (forgive me if I sound too drama or cliche) on going into that dream course! NTU/NUS/SMU requires students to write more about themselves for the courses they require to get into/why and there is a portion for non-accademic achievements. Remember to fill that up! Don't think it is not important because there are many people with the same GPA as you, so how do they consider applicants? To see if they have any additional talents/achievements they can bring with them outside their GPA!!! I cannot stress this enough, especially if you are from a poly! Also, I feel you about not being able to get into a local university of my choice! I screwed up my admission to get into my several dream courses at various Local U's during the first year because I thought they only look at GPA, and hence I didn't really bother much with the interview/and did not fill my non-CCA achievements. I thought I would definitely secure a place butI was so FRIGGIN WRONG. I felt like I was going to die literally because I couldn't get into a Local U. It was awful because I worked so friggin hard in poly D': Fortunately, I managed to pull myself together and manage to not screw up the second time and got into a local U with a course of my choice  So, DONT GIVE UP BRO. Now that you are closer to ORD, find some time to improve yourself, hunt down your poly lecturer to write you that testimonial letter for your university admission as they will really help. You are a merit holder, I am sure you have worked hard for it and paid attention during leessons. Your lecturers 会给你面子 if you are sincere and ask nicely!   If all else fails, there is always a local university route outside of NTU/NUS and it can be even better than the two.. but I can't say here.. later people will think I am biased towards certain university...

I think you shouldn't get too caught up with reputation right now, it is something that shouldn't take precedence over your interests and your desired career - mainly because it isn't as important as you think it is. I've a senior, an IP student from one of the top JCs who scored straight B's for his A levels did not get called for an interview for his 1st nor 2nd choice at SMU. Fella decided to go to SIM to pursue his studies in a similar field and is earning quite a lot working as a trader for a fund now.  There are a lot of ways you can monetize your degree - as long as you are doing what you want to do you will think of ways to do so. If you're going to do Jap studies but you're interested in Finance, then do take some finance mods if that is possible, join a finance CCA, take up CFA, participate in competitions, write a paper on Japan and show your employer that you are well versed with Jap culture and at the same time highly passionate (and active) in the finance side of things - you will be an amazing hire for a company looking to expand into / their operations in Japan.  It is important for us not to get caught up with the rankings. I cannot stress this enough - at the end of the day, it is who you are, what you've done and how you're working towards your goals that matter, not the reputation of your University.  Just to share: the decision for me was simple back then - I've sorted out my interests, understood what I needed to do... so I picked the one that's closest to where I live  And my parents are both members of KRGH so that made the choice even more obvious! Thanks for the great advice!  I am offered to do Linguistics in NTU, and it's a more attractive offer now especially since I am offered a scholarship there. The truth is, I love languages, and I'm obsessed with Japanese as well. Been learning the language since P5, over 9 years liao. Been exposed to the culture since I was born, so I am very influenced and in love with it. But still, I don't really see the point in doing Japanese Studies.  I am a Tourism/Business student in NP, so I have both business and hospitality backgrounds to fall upon. I am thinking of being a translator/interpreter, but doing Jap Studies would be pointless since I can't just concentrate on just one language. Being an Eng teacher in Japan would be nice as well, and that would require linguistics studies... The worst thing is, both degrees have one of the lowest starting salary among all the degrees, am now hesitating on whether to appeal to NBS instead... :/ cGPA: ard 3.82 O level: L1R5=4, L1R4=6",11.512436941388003

Hey! Congrats on being shortlisted for SMU SIS interview! First and foremost, you can find numerous blogs and forums with information about the interview. That aside, I've just went for the interview on 9th April and have just received an acceptance email today. So I will be actually telling you what to expect for the interview but it may differ. Firstly, it is a group interview which  consists of 2 interviewers (professors) and 6 interviewees including you. Upon arrival, you will be led to a room by current SIS student volunteers where they will brief you through the interview progress. You will then be given 15 minutes to complete a form whereby you have to state specific examples of certain characteristics and traits (eg. Leadership, curiosity etc). On the same form you have to list down 3 questions you wanna ask the professors. Another 15 minutes will be given to you to design (sketch on a black paper) a Web page depending on the case study. Once completed, you will be led to another room where the interviewers will already be seated. One by one, you have to present your design to everybody. Do expect some questions to be asked by the professors pertaining to your design.  Next comes the famous SMU estimation question and you have 4 minutes to write down your answer on a piece of paper. The question I received was, ""How many A4 sized papers are used for exam questions in SMU per semester."" They do not care about your final answer but are more concern on your thought process. So make realistic and sound assumptions before arriving to your final answer. The professors may ask the origin of your assumption. So make sure you know how to explain. Lastly, the interview will end of with a Q&A session whereby questions you have listed on earlier will be answered. Do not list down questions which can be easily found on SMU's website.  Be confident and show your passion towards IS while presenting your ideas. SMU SIS looks for students who are able to analyse problems fast with critical thinking skills. As long as you make an effort to prepare for the interview, you have won half of the battle. With that,  I wish you all the best for the interview",11.311514782810246

NUS cannot choose their specialisation as what they wish, CAP is still a consideration. So far the only subject I have trouble understanding the lecturer is stats, most prof are Singaporean and speak rather well.

Mechanical Engineering is very broad and prospects seem better but I'm not really sure if I really wanna do it.  If both NUS and NTU offered me the same course, I'll choose NUS. But the different courses are making my choice difficult. Pls let me know your views. Any advice is greatly appreciated. Thanks Christ... For pete's sake, NUS and NTU - No f**king difference. When you graduate from either schools from the same course like mech eng to mech eng, employment will be the same. The school's name will not shortchange you of anything.

Same pay, same platform to begin, its not a private school, stop dwelling on it. Mech eng can look at companies like Pratt and Whitney, Rollys Royce, Hyflux, Shell, BP, basically companies that have automation require engineers to maintain, improve and develop them.

I see that NTU has affiliations with MPA so that's a good start. However, it is a niche field, its NOT engineering.  Honestly, I would take mech eng, not that maritime sounds bad. If you have interest in it, then gun it, do f**king well and get headhunted by stat board or private firms.  But please please, look at what you will be learning in these 2 distinct and different courses then make a decision. The modules are online, you can take a look at what you will learn, what tie ups does the school have, what internships can you be looking at, what is the cohort size to assess your competition like.

This is as unisim graduates have to go through a relevant 6 months internship and more networking opportunities as some of their modules is taken together with part time students who are already working full time. Ntu sociology does offer internship opportunities but from what I was told by the ntu sociology processor during my interview, only about 50 percent will go for it.  5) post-degree education  After working some time, I will be aiming to get a Mba. From what I understand, both degrees are recognised by the big 3 for Mba (hope I am not wrong on this.

Side note : For those whose first response is to appeal, I have already started on my appealing processes. However, I do have to make a choice between this 2 offers by 2nd June and I do not want to rely on my appeal results in the event it turns sour. I am also not interested in taking a gap year.  Thank you for reading till the end of this post and I look forward to your input. 4) NTU Soci does have internships, but scoring one is rather difficult. Its not that only 50% want to do it. Rather only 50% can actually get it. In terms of employment. NTU soci is at an abysmal 55.8% full-time employment rate. If it was any other course, I would ask you to go to NTU, but since its soci, I think you should think twice about it. Even ADM has a higher full-time employment rate at 61.4%.

For NTU, that's 4 years for normal students and 3 for biz/acct. If you take longer than the stipulated time to graduate, you will be spending that extra semesters paying in full. However, NTU is gracious enough to still subsidise you at the same rate but this time. Refer here for the prices: -edit-  AFTER subsidy, the price is about 7.8k/year. Before subsidy, its 28.6k/year. Not many people actually realise how much MOE actually subsidises tuition fees. There is no need to repay them, even if you fail your course and drop out half way. However, you can only get tuition grant once in your life. Meaning if you spend 4 years and drop out/graduate. You wont get tuition grant again. 28.6k/year! So much! That's like the tuition fee for an international student already O_O  Thanks for the reply. I still have two more questions, if you don't mind.  1) Do you need to meet a maximum household income requirement to qualify for the MOE Tuition Grant? Because I felt that it is targeted more for ""lower-income"" families, so they can afford to pay the tuition fees. For example, per capita household income of $1k or something like that.  2)  According to this:  htt p://admiss ions.ntu.ed u.sg/UndergraduateAdmissi ons/FinancialAssista nce/Pages/Bursary byNTU.aspx For full-time undergraduates, it seems like the PCI is $950, yet it also says $1900 per month.

In fact, NS should be an advantage especially if you get into command school! (That is also considered a non-accademic achievement) Other awards like best soldier may help too! NS is the best time to talk about your experiences and what made you decide (forgive me if I sound too drama or cliche) on going into that dream course! NTU/NUS/SMU requires students to write more about themselves for the courses they require to get into/why and there is a portion for non-accademic achievements. Remember to fill that up! Don't think it is not important because there are many people with the same GPA as you, so how do they consider applicants? To see if they have any additional talents/achievements they can bring with them outside their GPA!!! I cannot stress this enough, especially if you are from a poly! Also, I feel you about not being able to get into a local university of my choice! I screwed up my admission to get into my several dream courses at various Local U's during the first year because I thought they only look at GPA, and hence I didn't really bother much with the interview/and did not fill my non-CCA achievements. I thought I would definitely secure a place butI was so FRIGGIN WRONG. I felt like I was going to die literally because I couldn't get into a Local U. It was awful because I worked so friggin hard in poly D': Fortunately, I managed to pull myself together and manage to not screw up the second time and got into a local U with a course of my choice  So, DONT GIVE UP BRO. Now that you are closer to ORD, find some time to improve yourself, hunt down your poly lecturer to write you that testimonial letter for your university admission as they will really help. You are a merit holder, I am sure you have worked hard for it and paid attention during leessons. Your lecturers 会给你面子 if you are sincere and ask nicely!

This is as unisim graduates have to go through a relevant 6 months internship and more networking opportunities as some of their modules is taken together with part time students who are already working full time. Ntu sociology does offer internship opportunities but from what I was told by the ntu sociology processor during my interview, only about 50 percent will go for it.  5) post-degree education  After working some time, I will be aiming to get a Mba. From what I understand, both degrees are recognised by the big 3 for Mba (hope I am not wrong on this. The info online is quite sparse on this)  My dilemma; to a pick a less reputable but more specialised and relevant degree or pick one that's more reputable and general in nature.  Side note : For those whose first response is to appeal, I have already started on my appealing processes. However, I do have to make a choice between this 2 offers by 2nd June and I do not want to rely on my appeal results in the event it turns sour. I am also not interested in taking a gap year.  Thank you for reading till the end of this post and I look forward to your input. 4) NTU Soci does have internships, but scoring one is rather difficult. Its not that only 50% want to do it. Rather only 50% can actually get it. In terms of employment. NTU soci is at an abysmal 55.8% full-time employment rate. If it was any other course, I would ask you to go to NTU, but since its soci, I think you should think twice about it. Even ADM has a higher full-time employment rate at 61.4%.

But on the other hand, you are looking to take an MBA, not any other post-grad course. MBA usually requires candidates to have an excellent work portfolio, so coming from unisim wouldn't really matter.

2015,National University of Singapore|nus|computer|com|infosys|information systems|analytics|smart city,interview|Discretionary|aptitude|Scholarship,"How Singapore's six public universities differ Published in ST on 3 March 2015http://www.straitstimes.com/singapor...rsities-differ With six public universities, students now have a diverse range of degrees to choose from. To attract the best students, the universities are striving to be different - in their programmes, tuition fees, student and faculty mix, accommodation options, financial help and overseas opportunities. Calvin Yang looks at the options offered. FULL-TIME DEGREE PROGRAMMES National University of Singapore (NUS): It has more than 50 full-time degrees, with exclusive ones such as those in dentistry, music and pharmacy. Nanyang Technological University (NTU): It has more than 50 degrees, with niche programmes such as communication studies, and sport science and management. Singapore Management University (SMU): It offers seven full-time programmes such as accountancy, law, information systems management and an SUTD-SMU dual degree programme in technology and management, launched last year. Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD): Its five degrees include architecture and sustainable design, engineering product development, engineering systems and design, and information systems technology and design. Singapore Institute of Technology (SIT): Catering mainly to polytechnic graduates, the university has 36 programmes - some offered by reputable partner universities and others run solely by SIT. The programmes include culinary arts management, criminology and security, game design and naval architecture. SIM University (UniSIM): The university synonymous with part-time degrees recently started offering full-time programmes in accountancy, finance and marketing. It will introduce a fourth full-time degree in human resource management this year. TUITION FEES These are for Singaporean students admitted in the academic year 2014/2015, except for UniSIM undergraduates. NUS: Annual tuition fees range between $7,850 - for courses like computing, engineering, and arts and social sciences - and $24,200 for medicine and dentistry. NTU: Fees are between $7,850 for most programmes, and $31,500 for medical students. SMU: Undergraduates who started last August are paying $11,100 per year, except for law students, who are paying $12,300. SUTD: An education at the university costs $11,650 per year. SIT: Annual fees range from $10,100 to $15,300. UniSIM: This year's accountancy students will pay about $33,000 for the entire degree programme, while students from other programmes will pay about $31,000. FINANCIAL HELP NUS: It has a wide range of scholarships and financial aid available. Over the past five years, it has seen a two-fold increase in students receiving scholarships, from about 800 in 2009 to 1,650 in 2013. There was a 60 per cent increase in the number of students receiving bursaries over the same period. NTU: For the new academic year that starts in August, it will be providing about 500 full-term scholarships, namely the Nanyang Scholarship and College Scholarship. Singaporean students interested in taking up a bursary each will receive assistance as long as their household per capita income is $1,900 or less per month. SMU: It has a comprehensive range of financial schemes. For scholarships, about 60 per cent of those who apply have been successful in securing a scholarship supported by the university or its donors. SUTD: It offers 173 scholarships and 43 bursaries, excluding government ones. SIT: More than 10 per cent of students are on scholarships or sponsorships by their employers or prospective employers. UniSIM: About a dozen scholarships, such as the SIM University Scholarship, and bursaries, such as the Ministry of Education Bursary, are available to students. STUDENT RESIDENCES NUS: The six halls of residence, four student residences and five residential colleges offer about 11,000 places in all for full-time students. A one-week stay in a typical single, non-air-conditioned room costs between $110 and $130. NTU: Its 18 residential halls house more than 10,400 undergraduates. Rental fees range from $225 to $280 monthly for a twin-sharing room. SMU: It does not have any student residences for local students. SUTD: It has three student housing blocks with a capacity of around 1,100 beds. Depending on the room type, an undergraduate typically pays around $350 to $480 per month. SIT: It does not offer any student residences. UniSIM: It does not have any student accommodation. OVERSEAS EXPOSURE NUS: About 70 per cent of undergraduates have at least an overseas exposure stint, such as summer school or internships. NTU: Some 80 per cent of students get some form of overseas exposure, such as taking classes at a partner university overseas. SMU: About 86 per cent of students have some form of overseas exposure, mainly through student exchange programmes. SUTD: Nearly 60 per cent of undergraduates have overseas experience. SIT: All students taking programmes offered by its partner universities abroad must go for an Overseas Immersion Programme as part of the curriculum. They spend between three and 17 weeks at the home campus of the university. Also, nearly all undergraduates doing SIT's own programmes have gone on study trips and work-study initiatives overseas. UniSIM: Its full-time students must go for an overseas stint during their studies. Currently, they have not started their stints, which may include a work attachment programme or a service learning project.",11.953309808653264

Dean level are too high, they dont micro-manage down to the undergraduate admissions level. At most they do get involved in grad students admissions. Try appealing to an Assoc Prof or an Asst Prof.  2. I believe there is only one window of official appeal. Any appeals outside of the NTU system(ie. directly to the prof) would be counted as informal appeals. 4. Soci is essay and exam based. There is always a compulsory module in your first semester that will teach you how to craft uni-level essays.",10.105438632234312

Around 30 out of 600 students will get in.  Super tough to get FCH but relatively easy to get 2nd Upper. Gradings works like bell curve. In simple terms, you score is relative to everyone's else score. You get 80/100 also can become C is everyone else gets 90/100.  A+/A/A- not easy to get.  Our average is around B+. Which I hear is different from other faculties which have usually an average of B. Don't ask me why different, I just observed that NBS got higher percentage of 2nd Uppers compared to other faculties.  So if you get average for everything, can graduate with 2nd Upper. Around 40% to 50% of the cohort can graduate with 2nd Upper from what my seniors tell me. But remember hor, only the top bunch in your poly will make it in here in the first place, so to be the average in NBS is like being super super godly back in your poly.  That's why I tell my super competitive friends no need to worry so much. Its okay to score average here, still is actually very good already.

So i guess comp sci students have no refresher course that is useful to apply? Anyone knows anything...

To attract the best students, the universities are striving to be different - in their programmes, tuition fees, student and faculty mix, accommodation options, financial help and overseas opportunities. Calvin Yang looks at the options offered. FULL-TIME DEGREE PROGRAMMES National University of Singapore (NUS): It has more than 50 full-time degrees, with exclusive ones such as those in dentistry, music and pharmacy. Nanyang Technological University (NTU): It has more than 50 degrees, with niche programmes such as communication studies, and sport science and management.

Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD): Its five degrees include architecture and sustainable design, engineering product development, engineering systems and design, and information systems technology and design. Singapore Institute of Technology (SIT): Catering mainly to polytechnic graduates, the university has 36 programmes - some offered by reputable partner universities and others run solely by SIT. The programmes include culinary arts management, criminology and security, game design and naval architecture. SIM University (UniSIM): The university synonymous with part-time degrees recently started offering full-time programmes in accountancy, finance and marketing. It will introduce a fourth full-time degree in human resource management this year. TUITION FEES These are for Singaporean students admitted in the academic year 2014/2015, except for UniSIM undergraduates.

FINANCIAL HELP NUS: It has a wide range of scholarships and financial aid available. Over the past five years, it has seen a two-fold increase in students receiving scholarships, from about 800 in 2009 to 1,650 in 2013. There was a 60 per cent increase in the number of students receiving bursaries over the same period. NTU: For the new academic year that starts in August, it will be providing about 500 full-term scholarships, namely the Nanyang Scholarship and College Scholarship. Singaporean students interested in taking up a bursary each will receive assistance as long as their household per capita income is $1,900 or less per month. SMU: It has a comprehensive range of financial schemes. For scholarships, about 60 per cent of those who apply have been successful in securing a scholarship supported by the university or its donors.

NTU: Some 80 per cent of students get some form of overseas exposure, such as taking classes at a partner university overseas. SMU: About 86 per cent of students have some form of overseas exposure, mainly through student exchange programmes. SUTD: Nearly 60 per cent of undergraduates have overseas experience. SIT: All students taking programmes offered by its partner universities abroad must go for an Overseas Immersion Programme as part of the curriculum. They spend between three and 17 weeks at the home campus of the university. Also, nearly all undergraduates doing SIT's own programmes have gone on study trips and work-study initiatives overseas. UniSIM: Its full-time students must go for an overseas stint during their studies. Currently, they have not started their stints, which may include a work attachment programme or a service learning project.",12.297354518853343

2015,National University of Singapore|nus|computer|com|infosys|information systems|analytics|smart city,career|prospect,"SINGAPORE: Ngee Ann Polytechnic (NP) will introduce a new programme in August next year to offer polytechnic graduates another pathway to become chartered accountants.  In a media release on Friday (Dec 11), NP said polytechnic graduates who participate in the SkillsFuture Earn-and-Learn Programme for Accountancy will get to acquire work experience and professional skills while pursuing further study options part-time, through a ""structured work-study pathway"".  The qualification, offered by NP in collaboration with the Singapore Accountancy Commission (SAC), will see polytechnic graduates who successfully complete the 18-month programme awarded with an Advanced Diploma in Accountancy.  ""The certification offers an alternative pathway for polytechnic graduates and part-time students to become Chartered Accountants of Singapore, without first having to obtain degree qualifications. Upon completion of the Earn-and-Learn Programme, they will be eligible to enrol in the Singapore Qualification Programme (QP),"" NP said. The diploma's curriculum was jointly developed by NP and SAC, the polytechnic said, adding that SAC has also engaged industry players for both the SkillsFuture Earn-and-Learn Programme as well as Enhanced Internships for the Accountancy and Financial Services Sector.  At present, polytechnic graduates have to first complete an accredited accountancy degree and the Singapore QP before they could quality to be Chartered Accountants of Singapore. Those without an accredited degree have to go through an additional Foundation Programme before proceeding to the Singapore QP, NP said.  POLYTECHNIC, ITE STUDENTS OFFERED ENHANCED INTERNSHIPS NP also announced on Friday that polytechnic and ITE students will be offered enhanced internships in the Accountancy and Financial Services sector from 2016 under the SkillsFuture initiative.  NP, Nanyang Polytechnic, Republic Polytechnic, Singapore Polytechnic, Temasek Polytechnic and the Institute of Technical Education (ITE) signed a Memorandum of Understanding with 16 accounting companies and financial institutions to provide these internships to their students on Friday afternoon, NP said.  The enhanced internships are longer than usual internship stints, and are structured with clear learning outcomes and job scopes. They will also be matched with industry mentors who will guide them at the workplace and advise them on career growth in the sector. They will be rolled out in 2016 for 2,400 polytechnic and ITE students.  Companies on board include Baker Tilly TFW, BDO, Citibank, DBS, Deloitte & Touche, Ernst & Young, Foo Kon Tan, HSBC, KPMG, Mazars, Nexia TS Public Accounting Corporation, OCBC, PricewaterhouseCoopers, RSM Stone Forest, Singapore Exchange and UOB.  - CNA/dl",9.552461146331614

For instance, is there substantial benefit to having a second major in business, be it career opportunity or personal furtherance of knowledge. At the same time, the time and effort involved could distract from the first major. If you end up losing an Honours class or two due to this distraction, the second major may not be able to compensate. Before touching on workload (and hence corresponding effort), I'll like to address this point on honours first. Unlike a double degree where your grades are kept separate (You can have a First Class in Business, a Second Class in Accountancy), a single degree with second major merges your grades in the GPA computation. Your second major modules grades directly affects your honours class like your core does. That means you could have straight As for your First Major, but if you mess up your 2nd Major you could end up with a worse honours class!  If you're gunning for a First Class and you don't want to be tied down by your 2nd major, that's an average A- you need for all the biz mods. If you're going for a Second Upper, that's an average B+. So how hard is it to get a B+ or A- for those business mods, and how much effort is required? Why, the same amount of effort you need to get a 2nd Upper or First Class in Business school of course.  More seriously, the short answer is this varies module by module. The # of AUs of a module is a terrible measure. Some I managed a B+ despite mugging day and night. Others I aced with minimum effort. Really difficult to quantify. Generally speaking though (no concrete statistics), I'm guessing close to half of us business students do get B+ for each module after bell curve is factored. The average is about B to B+. So you just need to be slightly above average. Doesn't sound too bad, but the average student here does put in quite a bit.  The long answer, for a detailed breakdown of the workload involved in each of the module you have to take under the 2nd major programme, I'll wait till after my exams to write that.

SIT: All students taking programmes offered by its partner universities abroad must go for an Overseas Immersion Programme as part of the curriculum. They spend between three and 17 weeks at the home campus of the university. Also, nearly all undergraduates doing SIT's own programmes have gone on study trips and work-study initiatives overseas. UniSIM: Its full-time students must go for an overseas stint during their studies. Currently, they have not started their stints, which may include a work attachment programme or a service learning project.",12.442449565091003

I have a friend who actually transferred from MAE to NBS lol.  Thing is, for a lot of people, A-level grades and poly GPA have little influence on University performance. My A-level grades were CDD but I'm maintaining a first class now lol. So its not impossible.  Maybe for poly people, your poly GPA and uni GPA is more related if your poly course is similar to your university course. But for the rest who are from JC or are from unrelated poly courses, you will never know how they perform in uni.  The process of switching course is very simple. In your first year, take NBS modules as electives, drop some of your cores in order to make space and time for those electives. Score well in those NBS modules and then apply for transfer. Of course, the scoring well part is usually the difficult part. But if you really want it its actually not that difficult. All you need is around the range of B+/A-. You need the range of A-/A. The threshold for a transfer in has increased considerably. You need a ~4.0+ for internal transfer (from biz to acc, but acc to biz is a free deal, gpa less than 3 also can), and 4.5+ from another faculty.  If you are a CCC student who manage to make a come back and get a First Class, then yes, this is the group that may stand a chance. But I daresay not many would be in this category. For poly students in particular, the correlation is very real. Mind you, I was the book prize winner (top student) in certain modules in poly, and I still get B+/A- here despite best efforts. If your poly GPA isn't high enough to get into business, then you are unlikely to score well enough in the same mods to transfer in, unless you work super hard. (And yes, everyone works super work in Year 1) Another hurdle you may face is with effect from 2015, many NBS modules are no longer available as Unrestricted Electives. This is due to some new 2nd Major partnership, and the 'extra seats' we had last time is now given to this group. I just checked the intranet and confirm there are very very few common cores that non-nbs students are permitted to take.  All that said, if you're really brave, there really isn't anything to lose by applying for the transfer after Y1S1.  I wouldn't, however, recommend you entering NTU with the mindset or expectation that it would be easy.",10.754181132285716

I mean just because you were top student in poly and only get B+ doesn't mean the other poly grads who did not get as high GPA in poly did not do better than you in uni. Yup, I think that would pose a problem for anyone who wants to transfer in. But there are still a few modules available. Still, NBS would probably be more difficult to transfer to as compared to HSS or SPMS. Engineering would be totally impossible since no engineering core can be taken as UE. No one would want to either lol. Nicholas92 wrote:  I wouldn't, however, recommend you entering NTU with the mindset or expectation that it would be easy. I strongly do not encourage this, as failing the transfer could seriously screw up your curriculum and result in you delaying graduation. This is a high risk gamble. Yeah, no one should enter uni with the mindset of transferring over just in case he/she does not make it. And yes, it is a very high risk gamble. But if you really don't like your current course you won't have much to lose. Also, everyone has to take some UEs anyway. Engine students take 5UEs and HSS has 10UEs. So you will still be able to graduate in 4 years time if you don't get to transfer as long as you don't do more than the allocated UEs. While your peers are doing their UEs you will be catching up on your cores. I know for NBS certain mods are only available in certain semesters. But for engineering with high fail rates, most year 1 and 2 modules are available in both semesters so you can catch up easily.",10.406842402342427

In a media release on Friday (Dec 11), NP said polytechnic graduates who participate in the SkillsFuture Earn-and-Learn Programme for Accountancy will get to acquire work experience and professional skills while pursuing further study options part-time, through a ""structured work-study pathway"".  The qualification, offered by NP in collaboration with the Singapore Accountancy Commission (SAC), will see polytechnic graduates who successfully complete the 18-month programme awarded with an Advanced Diploma in Accountancy.  ""The certification offers an alternative pathway for polytechnic graduates and part-time students to become Chartered Accountants of Singapore, without first having to obtain degree qualifications. Upon completion of the Earn-and-Learn Programme, they will be eligible to enrol in the Singapore Qualification Programme (QP),"" NP said. The diploma's curriculum was jointly developed by NP and SAC, the polytechnic said, adding that SAC has also engaged industry players for both the SkillsFuture Earn-and-Learn Programme as well as Enhanced Internships for the Accountancy and Financial Services Sector.  At present, polytechnic graduates have to first complete an accredited accountancy degree and the Singapore QP before they could quality to be Chartered Accountants of Singapore. Those without an accredited degree have to go through an additional Foundation Programme before proceeding to the Singapore QP, NP said.  POLYTECHNIC, ITE STUDENTS OFFERED ENHANCED INTERNSHIPS NP also announced on Friday that polytechnic and ITE students will be offered enhanced internships in the Accountancy and Financial Services sector from 2016 under the SkillsFuture initiative.  NP, Nanyang Polytechnic, Republic Polytechnic, Singapore Polytechnic, Temasek Polytechnic and the Institute of Technical Education (ITE) signed a Memorandum of Understanding with 16 accounting companies and financial institutions to provide these internships to their students on Friday afternoon, NP said.  The enhanced internships are longer than usual internship stints, and are structured with clear learning outcomes and job scopes. They will also be matched with industry mentors who will guide them at the workplace and advise them on career growth in the sector. They will be rolled out in 2016 for 2,400 polytechnic and ITE students.

2016,National University of Singapore|nus|computer|com|infosys|information systems|analytics|smart city,interview|Discretionary|aptitude|Scholarship,"Which university? Which course of study?Aim for a course that best suits you, rather than enrol in the most lucrative one Tan Eng Chye Prof Tan is deputy president (academic affairs) and provost at the National University of Singapore. PUBLISHED 6 HOURS AGOhttp://www.straitstimes.com/singapor...ourse-of-study The university admissions season is in full swing, and this is an exciting time for students in Singapore. The tertiary education landscape here has expanded significantly, and there are now many varied and interesting pathways for students to choose from, from traditional professional degree courses in medicine or engineering, to music and the liberal arts and science. Many parents I met at the National University of Singapore's (NUS) Open Day last month remarked that they are envious of the plethora of choices their children have, and wish to be young once more. Some of you may have secured multiple offers from different universities in Singapore and overseas, and you will have to make an acceptance decision soon. But how should one decide? Every year, the Ministry of Education publishes the employment rates and median starting salaries of fresh graduates of the different degree programmes offered by local universities. I certainly hope students do not make decisions based solely on data obtained through the Graduate Employment Survey (GES). GES data provides an indication of starting salaries. Starting salaries are but a guide; they neither set the course nor determine one's career trajectory or destiny. In this volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous or ""Vuca"" world, one cannot predict the future or where the lucrative jobs will be. You would therefore want your university education to equip you with broad-based life skills, and develop you with the flexibility and resilience needed to pick up new knowledge, adapt to new circumstances, and exploit job opportunities across a variety of sectors throughout your lifetime of careers. Another consideration is whether and how the university course adds value to your educational journey. Some students (and parents) may look to university rankings as a measure of the strength of a university department. And there are definitely synergies between research and education. If the university department excels in research, and counts world-leading researchers in the field, it is likely that cutting-edge research will filter through to your learning experience. You will have the opportunity to be taught by highly regarded academics, and there will be plenty of opportunities to conduct research under the who's-who in the field. This is particularly valuable if you have a very strong interest in research or academia. Choosing a university that excels in your area of interest may also open up more specialised opportunities, such as advanced facilities, academic opportunities such as overseas study or research trips, as well as internships and employment opportunities with prestigious organisations in the industry. Beyond academic reputation, your choice of university will also affect your life intellectually, socially and professionally. You should evaluate the entire student experience, and whether it will suit you. Find out if the social setting on campus is what you would want to be part of. NUS has, for example, the Yale-NUS College and the University Town Residential College programmes, which offer an integrated living and learning experience, amid a collegial and intellectually vibrant setting. Another distinctive programme is the NUS Overseas Colleges programme, where students get to live, work and study in an entrepreneurial hub such as Silicon Valley, New York City or Stockholm, taking entrepreneurship classes at a partner university while working in promising entrepreneurial start-ups. All universities have carefully developed their own suite of programmes and it is worth your time and effort to find out what is on offer. Talk to the professors, and to current students. Universities hold Open Days and various outreach sessions where you can visit the campus and get first-hand information. The best-ranked university or the programme that offers you two degrees in the shortest duration may sound attractive, but they may not necessarily be what you are looking for.  Some of you may want an intensely academic experience, and to pick up as many degrees in the shortest possible time. Yet others may prefer to develop a broader range of capabilities, to try out new things, or to pursue more varied experiences. You should aim to identify a university and a course that best suits you, and not simply enrol in the most competitive or lucrative course. After all, you will be spending your next three to four years in this programme. For those of you whose grades may not meet the degree programme's published entry requirements, do not give up. All local universities have discretionary admissions schemes. Last year, NUS interviewed a record 1,600 students under the scheme, and admitted 670 students. This scheme allows universities to assess applicants more holistically, and to consider their passions and attributes such as leadership, resilience or entrepreneurial skills or talent in non-academic areas. The good news is that from the next academic year onwards, NUS, Nanyang Technological University and Singapore Management University can take in more students under the Discretionary Admissions Scheme, from 10 per cent of the annual intake currently, to up to 15 per cent. This will enable more students to enter universities on the basis of their strengths and talents, beyond academic performance. There is no perfect university. What is key is to make a considered decision with the resources and information that are available to you. Your degree should help start you on the journey to where you want to go. The knowledge, experiences and opportunities in your university life should also prepare you for life beyond your degree. As a student in Singapore, you will have up to the beginning of June to decide on your offers from most of the local universities. Whatever you eventually decide on, make the most of your university experience because, for many, it will be the best time of your life.",14.892926455039898

TELL ME, WHICH FKING UNI IN THIS WORLD GIVES MONEY TO FOREIGNERS FOR STUDYING IN THEIR COUNTRY? the last i checked, the tuition grant comes from taxpayers. which happen to be mostly SINGAPOREANS. what right do the foreigner scum have to receive the grant? they should be paying EVERY SINGLE CENT themselves. gosh, cheapest recognised degree in the world for foreigners. Undergraduate intake for international students are more or less 20%. And they are moving towards reducing international students intake to 15% in the future, in concurrent with another movement to incrementally increase the local intake towards 40% of the cohort. If you are talking about the population of international students at any given time, then it is definitely more than 20%, due to the movement of students globally across universities. There are no dumping grounds in our universities, each faculties have their own industry and merits. But of course, if these faculties don't innovate with the times and keep a close relationship with the industry players, they will be left behind. Your use of the employment rates to determine dumping ground is flawed, there is a difference in the future prospects and individual choices between professional degrees and academic degrees. There will be a percentage of students from these academic degrees moving on to post-graduate programmes to deepen their knowledge and research in their respective fields, some will also move on to NIE or IAL, so they may teach or formulate curriculum at a higher level, beyond primary and secondary. Some international students may apply for MOE tuition grants, in return these students will have to work in a singapore company and contribute to our economy. These students working as foreigners will also be paying higher taxes than locals, which in turn translates into money to spend in national programmes. And providing Education is one of the ways, Singapore build her soft power globally. You may wish to update yourself with what is happening globally, many foreign countries, universities and companies are providing grants, bursaries, scholarships, fellowships to prospective students globally to study in their country, which includes many sinkies whom have benefited from such programmes.",14.4260870829955
2016,National University of Singapore|nus|computer|com|infosys|information systems|analytics|smart city,interview|Discretionary|aptitude|Scholarship,"DISCLAIMER: I'd like to say that this post is not meant to flame anyone or put a negative spotlight on anyone. The examples I highlighted below are simply the comments/questions that I spotted which inspired me to write this. I wouldn't want to start a discussion about education in Singapore here, nor would this a debate for JC vs Poly. Just a little background about myself - I was a comms student in poly, did pretty average for my GPA (3.5x), missed the uni application in my first year of army, got rejected by NTU ADM last year, finally got a late acceptance letter from ADM this year. So trust me when I say I can empathise with those who are still waiting for their acceptance letter, and why some people are asking certain questions here.Spoiler!Hi guys, care to give your opinions and views on SMU Business VS NUS Statistics?  Which one will have higher demand by employers? The answer to this is simple, ask yourself where do you want to work? MNC? Local startup? The big 4? Starting your own business? Government sector? The 'value' of a degree is only given to by the people looking at it. Even then, there are those companies in each category that would defy the stereotypical hiring policy. So my advice to the poster who asked this question is to define who are your said 'employers' first. If you have no idea where you want to work or which sector of business you want to be in, it might serve you better to understand more about the course to see which specific programme/school/school culture might suit you better rather which degree appeals more to 'employers'. It's better to make an informed choice yourself.Spoiler!Actually, people do look at where you study. I got a couple of friends in HR. They told me that they would also look at the university, course, GPA/grades, modules taken, then any leadership roles regardless of how many years of relevant work experience a person has. Some say they tend to give more priority to old boys/girls, alum, that sort of thing. I'm not saying you're wrong here buddy, and in fact you're correct in saying this! But like I mentioned previously, it depends on where you're applying for work at, what is the company's hiring policy, what are they looking for etc. Comments like this might mislead some to think that this one degree/choice of school will make or break their future. What your friends experienced are the hiring policies of their particular companies they work at, but it's definitely not the same across various companies.There's no 'one size fits all' answer to certain questions. There is also no 'only one single path' to success. Some students don't realise it yet. This is the point that I'm driving at - Students should not be afraid to seek out multiple answers to a single question. There is always more than one way to solve a single question. Isn't that how it is for Math too? There may be one solution given in the answer book but it doesn't mean that that's the only one.If you do not get your university placing in the public schools this year, there are many other options! For poly students, you can take a gap year and work first, try again next year or the year after, like what I was planning to do myself should I not get my placing this year. Work experience ain't a bad idea too. For JC students, you can always take the A's again (like what some here are planning to do), to get a better grade for your dream course on the next application. I had a friend who couldn't get pharmaceutical, retook his A's while serving NS, scored a much better grade and went on to pharmaceutical on a scholarship in the end. If you really want to study this year, then private schools might be a viable idea as well. Yes things might not have gone according to plan for you. You might have been taught your whole life that you must get into NTU/NUS/SMU, or that might have been pressure on yourself. But fact is, if you're not getting in (even after appeal), then it's on you to take your next step forward. You have to keep moving forward in life despite the obstacles you face. If you're really rejected in the end, allow yourself to be sad for a little while, then pick yourself up, make plans, take the next step forward and move on. You might have to take a little detour, but it doesn't mean you can't get there. It's just how badly you want it. I hope this lengthy post written at 3am in the morning would encourage some of you even a little, because I know what it's like to constantly fail at every turn and have life keep pushing you down. If it did, then I'm glad. ",13.914541515490265
2016,National University of Singapore|nus|computer|com|infosys|information systems|analytics|smart city,interview|Discretionary|aptitude|Scholarship,"SINGAPORE: Three of Singapore's autonomous universities are refining the way they admit students under the Discretionary Admissions Scheme, which looks beyond a person's academic achievements. It comes as the universities prepare to take in more students under the scheme, when the current cap of 10 per cent allowed for discretionary admissions goes up to 15 per cent next year. ADVERTISING inRead invented by Teads National University of Singapore (NUS) is offering 7,000 places for the coming academic year, but it has received four times the number of applicants. While it has started handing out offers to those who made the cut based on their grades, about 1,800 students who did not are undergoing interviews to be considered for discretionary admissions this year. NUS has been evaluating and admitting more students under the scheme over the years. Last year, it evaluated 1,600 students, 400 more than 2014. 670 of them got in, 70 more than 2014. With more students expected to be considered for discretionary admissions, the process at NUS may be refined. Said Professor Tan Eng Chye, deputy president of academic affairs at NUS: “We are evolving; for instance, we have gotten alumni to help us with the interviews. I find that very useful because the alumni have a lot of experience in sizing up people and candidates, and they ask very useful questions. “We also provide more data on what to look out for and if the numbers get to be big, we may decide that maybe we can have sort of a test first - not an academic test per se, but perhaps a test to look at other non-academic aspects of that person. It could be an aptitude test.” Prof Tan added: “Exercising flexibility is one aspect; you also have to be fairly sharp on what to look for - it is not simply: 'OK, meet the numbers.' Our interest is to look for attributes of the applicants that would make the student community more interesting, more diversified, and enhance the interaction within the student community. “Those who can adequately and can eloquently convey their passions and interests - that would be advantageous. But we also have to look out for students who may not be able to communicate as well, but yet they have the potential for us to groom them to be able graduates.” At the Singapore Management University (SMU), discretionary admissions currently form about 5 to 8 per cent of the annual intake. With the higher cap of 15 per cent for such admissions next year, the university will have ""more leeway"" when assessing students. Professor Pang Yang Hoong, vice provost for undergraduate matters and student development at SMU, said: “For SMU, looking at students with other qualifications is not something terribly new because we always been holistic in the way we assess students and their suitability for admission. We will be more flexible. “(We look for) passion, the aptitude for the course for which we are admitting them into. It would also be ideal if students have demonstrated that they are successful to be in time management, that they also possess resilience and the ability to overcome difficult situations. This will help us to assess if that person has got the resilience and the determination to do well in the programme.” SMU is expecting more polytechnic graduates to apply through the discretionary route with the cap being raised to 15 per cent of the annual intake. Nanyang Technological University (NTU) will also ""broaden the criteria"", to give more people a shot at securing a place. It will favourably consider those who possess ""enthusiasm and relevant work experience"". Professor Kam Chan Hin, senior associate provost for undergraduate education at NTU, commented: “Normally, they will look at other achievements that they have - whether in sports, in arts … or even if they are very passionate about community service, leadership. So these are the things that we usually look for. “We are going to encourage all the schools to broaden the criteria, to allow more people who have a very strong passion, to be given the opportunity to be interviewed. We should be more adventurous, open it a bit more and ask more questions, outside of the usual parameters, and if you find somebody who is really very interesting and very passionate … give them a chance.” NTU had evaluated 1,400 students under the scheme last year and about 600 were given a place. All three universities said that even as they exercise flexibility, it is still important for students to show that they possess the ""adequate academic competence"" to go through the rigour and demands of a university education.  - CNA/ms",13.36177714596481

They asked me whether it's justifiable to discriminate based on race and I said yes because sometimes the nature of the industry requires it.

I think my profs asked if age discrimination is prevalent anywhere. But my answer was something like ""we need people of all age to help in product creation, like how young people are capable of picking innovative things and the old people are capable of picking durable things"" (???) OMG now that I think of it I think I really ran out of topic ... And I even blurted ""I don't know what I'm talking about"" The prof was like ""I'm not trying to make fun of you but I think we are talking about discrimination (blahblahblah), but you're pointing out their usefulness"" T_T I think your answer is correct eh, heard that they are not so strict w the interviewees' answers. At least you answered their Q!!! The others in my group also gave very strong and reasonable points to the profs' Q, with news as backup somemore. Wa fk man I feel that I left a bad impression on them, like I'm damn dumb or something I climb out of my bed at 2 am to post this haha.  If I'm the one in the interview i would answer this it's justifiable to discriminate based on race Discrimination in work should't be based on race but rather the person's ability to accept that there's people better than him/her, the person's ability to adapt to the environment and situation. A company with a diverse culture and background will be able to adept to different client based on their background making them feel like home while working with the company. A great team leader or boss will understand that there's always people better than them and their ability to accept them and not be jealous or potentially fearing that they may one day be replacing them will help the company push towards greater height.  As such, there's really no reason to discriminate others based on their race, rather we should be looking at the individual's potential contribution and ability to adept. Because i'm not sure how to understand this, i try to swing the question away. Another way is to provide a agree and disagree argument. You can also try to use points mention by your group such as ""I agree with simon and sam that bla bla bla. To add on to their point...bla bla bla. This shows you are thinking and listening to what others are saying and not just thinking of what to say making you a team player as well As for the age 1.  Age discrimination has and will always be an issue. We used to discriminate the younger generation, thinking they lack the experience to work as productivity as the older generation and being overly sheltered. But as we advance rapidly in technology, shifting towards work automation having machines replacing humans. it makes more sense to hire younger people that's capable of instantly understand how a machine works without much explanation or guidance.  The society is cruel and I simply do not see a value in hiring the older PMET while the younger one are capable of doing much more at half the cost. While hypocrite may suggest that the elderly are gems and should be highly value, they are simply talk the talk and not walk the talk. And as such age discrimination is a fact and it's a problem deeply rooted into society. I just strongly lean towards one side based on what i think. The question no right and wrong 1 la. They just wanna see how you think and if you are gonna swing towards other's opinion or hold on to yours  This is just my POV ah... Let me know what you guys think. To end this, i ask you guys this question.. Don't think more than 10 sec..  ""Plan an evacuation route."" Hint.

Describe yourself. 2. Why do you think we should accept you? How can you contribute to NTU? 3. Did you apply in other Universities as well?Probing Questions 1. Describe yourself in 2 sentences. [Stress Test -1] 2. Describe yourself in only 3 words. [Stress Test -1] 3. Which community areas did you serve? [Probing CCAs & Interests -2] 4. Why didn't you apply for Humanities & Social Studies instead? [Probing CCAs & Interests -2] 5. Why do you still want to choose NTU instead of NUS? [Universities Choice -3] Below are just my opinions. The interview ended surprisingly faster than expected - far less than 10 minutes. However, there were no questions related to assess my competency for ACBS, and I guess that these questions are completely the same as single degree interview. Also, I doubt they even know what I actually applied for. So for those who are applying ACBS as well, do rest assure.  Comparing NTU and SMU, I find that NTU is more rigid in the way they conduct their interviews. They seem to have a list of standardized questions to be asked. Whereas for SMU, after I spoken about my attachment in one of the Big 4, the whole conversation was all about the work I did, and how I was able to cope with stress in the environment. Very friendly professors. As such, it is much easier to control your conversation topic for SMU. Again, in my opinion, NTU is more interested in how you can contribute to NTU. Whilst for SMU, the professors really want to know you as an individual. Also, the interviewers in NTU seem to be expressionless; it feels that I was talking to robots, but at the very least they did hold eye contact with me. Both are equally efficient in conducting their interviews nevertheless. Generally agree with Aomatsu.  Just to add on, I went for the ACBS interview back in 2014, because, you know, NS, and the main interviewer was Prof Valerie. We had a rather entertaining conversation and it was more of a chit-chat session than an interview. NTU knows what courses you applied for. She had my application form in hard copy on the table (in full view) and asked me why I applied for REP as my 2nd choice, and only put Accountancy (single degree) as the 3rd choice. Other than that, the main focus was definitely on how I would contribute NTU if they offered me a place/scholarship. Of course I talked about joining some clubs in NBS, my career goals and the various competitions/events at NTU which interest me. They didn't ask me those ""essay"" kind of questions though, but we chatted for around 20 minutes. It was a very light-hearted and enjoyable session and it felt really short in fact. After the interview, the prof invited me to apply for the USP. I also went for the SMU interview (also in 2014) for the double degree programme in Accountancy and Business. I remember being interviewed by Prof Seow and Prof Gary Pan. They seemed really concerned about whether I applied to NUS/NTU and asked me which I would pick if I was offered all 3. It somehow gave me the impression that they were being insecure/desperate. However, I liked the fact that they gave more attention to my hobbies and interests and focused less on academic achievements. I guess this is one example of SMU's holistic admissions process. They were also constantly marketing their school throughout the interview by asking me if I knew that their school of accountancy was ranked xxx in the BYU rankings etc, and kept comparing them to the other 2 unis. What I got out of that interview was that the profs at SMU are really passionate about what they do and that they're incredibly driven especially when it comes to building the school's reputation.  At the end of the day, both are local universities. Employers will lump NUS/NTU/SMU together anyway. So in terms of employability, no difference really. Choose the school which suits your personality better.",13.185652527392902

SMU received 1,108 applications for the 45 places in the course, which means about 25 students are vying for every place. The demand for the new course has also led to a rise in total number of applications - 14,000 in all this year, a 6 per cent rise over last year. Earlier this year, when SMU announced the new course, its officials likened it to Oxford University's prestigious politics, philosophy and economics course. It is aimed at giving students a broad understanding of how the world works and will prepare them for a range of careers. Students who had applied for the course said it is an unusual combination since it includes the study of law with economics and politics - and prestigious to boot as it is being offered to only a select group of high-calibre students. Many were also drawn by the fact that the course would prepare them for a wide range of jobs, including in journalism, foreign affairs, public service, consulting and research. SMU provost Lily Kong said she was delighted with the response. She added: ""From all our engagement sessions, it is clear that students, parents and employers recognise the value that the PLE combination of disciplines can bring in preparing graduates who can handle multifaceted careers... ""Through a deeper understanding of how politics, law and economics intersect to shape the world in which we live, we hope to groom a new generation of leaders and thinkers for Singapore."" The 45 students selected for the course will take all three subjects in the first year, before specialising in one of four areas - global studies, distribution and justice, public policy and governance, or choice and behaviour - from year two. Students will also have to go on a 10-week internship during which they will work on a project to find solutions to a real-world problem. SMU said several firms have indicated their interest in offering internships to those on the course. They include the Economic Development Board as well as consultancies like Bain and Company. SMU officials said close to 5,000 of the 14,000 applicants have been shortlisted so far. They will be further assessed via interviews.

It is a very saddening case in recent times, I think it is partly in the failure of the education system to inculcate it and other personal factors. razorlala wrote: many of those sinkies are either buaykan parents got $ send them overseas, or are on scholarship. which reminds me, of the many scholarships offered for singapore, half are meant ONLY for foreigners. the other half got afew meant for locals n the rest for all to fight(thats like 2~3yrs back tho, not sure now) and mind enlightening me what grants other COUNTRIES are offering for foreigners to study in their country? many scholarships offered by priv companies are given to candidates whose parents are related to the company(eg biz partners, etc), often just to boost their portfolioYou may want to update yourself with the wide selection of scholarships available on BrightSparks for singaporeans.

Otherwise the government of the day can forget about surviving its next elections. Hence, SCs are by and large prioritised for admission over SPRs and international students. The fact is that SPRs (most, not all since there are stateless PRs around) and foreigners still owe their allegiance to their home countries.  It may be a flaw to you, but the system cannot assume nor decide which SPR applicant is going to stay or who is not. So it needs to apply the same standards throughout to keep it fair for every single SPR applying to the university. System discipline, if you've heard of the term. No hard feelings anyways. Wishing you all the best for your citizenship application when the time comes! actually, singapore is never crystal clear on the migration guidelines for applicants to be citizen. and alot of high flyer sinkies had to leave singapore becos their spouse is unable to be singapore citizen or even be PR. And there are also spouses who stayed >20 years working under a pass and not get PR.  and yes generally singaporeans are very ignorant until the day they decide to work n live in overseas for 3-5 years. and then they will ""wake up"" FYI for hitomi, there is a risk assessment table or formula of somesort they dun release to public. shall not go into any details on my speculation on what the factors may be. i wish u luck in ur future in whatever path u decide. =)",11.999943518589129

But your comment seems to exclude naturalized citizens, who moved here 1 generation ago. Their children enjoy the privileges of being a Singapore, and does the fact that their parents aren't Singapore-born (and hence contributed little to the country) mean that they are any ""less Singaporean""? You are in the position to say all this because you have been blind to the number of privileges you have enjoyed throughout your life. How do you feel receiving the same comment should you try out for renown schools like Cambridge or Oxford? The reason you should be thankful of being born a Singaporean is for the same reason. If everyone had a choice, they would all want to be born into a rich family in a country with high standards of living. Your birth is only due to natural selection...

TELL ME, WHICH FKING UNI IN THIS WORLD GIVES MONEY TO FOREIGNERS FOR STUDYING IN THEIR COUNTRY? the last i checked, the tuition grant comes from taxpayers. which happen to be mostly SINGAPOREANS. what right do the foreigner scum have to receive the grant? they should be paying EVERY SINGLE CENT themselves. gosh, cheapest recognised degree in the world for foreigners. Undergraduate intake for international students are more or less 20%. And they are moving towards reducing international students intake to 15% in the future, in concurrent with another movement to incrementally increase the local intake towards 40% of the cohort. If you are talking about the population of international students at any given time, then it is definitely more than 20%, due to the movement of students globally across universities. There are no dumping grounds in our universities, each faculties have their own industry and merits. But of course, if these faculties don't innovate with the times and keep a close relationship with the industry players, they will be left behind. Your use of the employment rates to determine dumping ground is flawed, there is a difference in the future prospects and individual choices between professional degrees and academic degrees. There will be a percentage of students from these academic degrees moving on to post-graduate programmes to deepen their knowledge and research in their respective fields, some will also move on to NIE or IAL, so they may teach or formulate curriculum at a higher level, beyond primary and secondary. Some international students may apply for MOE tuition grants, in return these students will have to work in a singapore company and contribute to our economy. These students working as foreigners will also be paying higher taxes than locals, which in turn translates into money to spend in national programmes.

2016,National University of Singapore|nus|computer|com|infosys|information systems|analytics|smart city,career|prospect,"Which university? Which course of study?Aim for a course that best suits you, rather than enrol in the most lucrative one Tan Eng Chye Prof Tan is deputy president (academic affairs) and provost at the National University of Singapore. PUBLISHED 6 HOURS AGOhttp://www.straitstimes.com/singapor...ourse-of-study The university admissions season is in full swing, and this is an exciting time for students in Singapore. The tertiary education landscape here has expanded significantly, and there are now many varied and interesting pathways for students to choose from, from traditional professional degree courses in medicine or engineering, to music and the liberal arts and science. Many parents I met at the National University of Singapore's (NUS) Open Day last month remarked that they are envious of the plethora of choices their children have, and wish to be young once more. Some of you may have secured multiple offers from different universities in Singapore and overseas, and you will have to make an acceptance decision soon. But how should one decide? Every year, the Ministry of Education publishes the employment rates and median starting salaries of fresh graduates of the different degree programmes offered by local universities. I certainly hope students do not make decisions based solely on data obtained through the Graduate Employment Survey (GES). GES data provides an indication of starting salaries. Starting salaries are but a guide; they neither set the course nor determine one's career trajectory or destiny. In this volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous or ""Vuca"" world, one cannot predict the future or where the lucrative jobs will be. You would therefore want your university education to equip you with broad-based life skills, and develop you with the flexibility and resilience needed to pick up new knowledge, adapt to new circumstances, and exploit job opportunities across a variety of sectors throughout your lifetime of careers. Another consideration is whether and how the university course adds value to your educational journey. Some students (and parents) may look to university rankings as a measure of the strength of a university department. And there are definitely synergies between research and education. If the university department excels in research, and counts world-leading researchers in the field, it is likely that cutting-edge research will filter through to your learning experience. You will have the opportunity to be taught by highly regarded academics, and there will be plenty of opportunities to conduct research under the who's-who in the field. This is particularly valuable if you have a very strong interest in research or academia. Choosing a university that excels in your area of interest may also open up more specialised opportunities, such as advanced facilities, academic opportunities such as overseas study or research trips, as well as internships and employment opportunities with prestigious organisations in the industry. Beyond academic reputation, your choice of university will also affect your life intellectually, socially and professionally. You should evaluate the entire student experience, and whether it will suit you. Find out if the social setting on campus is what you would want to be part of. NUS has, for example, the Yale-NUS College and the University Town Residential College programmes, which offer an integrated living and learning experience, amid a collegial and intellectually vibrant setting. Another distinctive programme is the NUS Overseas Colleges programme, where students get to live, work and study in an entrepreneurial hub such as Silicon Valley, New York City or Stockholm, taking entrepreneurship classes at a partner university while working in promising entrepreneurial start-ups. All universities have carefully developed their own suite of programmes and it is worth your time and effort to find out what is on offer. Talk to the professors, and to current students. Universities hold Open Days and various outreach sessions where you can visit the campus and get first-hand information. The best-ranked university or the programme that offers you two degrees in the shortest duration may sound attractive, but they may not necessarily be what you are looking for.  Some of you may want an intensely academic experience, and to pick up as many degrees in the shortest possible time. Yet others may prefer to develop a broader range of capabilities, to try out new things, or to pursue more varied experiences. You should aim to identify a university and a course that best suits you, and not simply enrol in the most competitive or lucrative course. After all, you will be spending your next three to four years in this programme. For those of you whose grades may not meet the degree programme's published entry requirements, do not give up. All local universities have discretionary admissions schemes. Last year, NUS interviewed a record 1,600 students under the scheme, and admitted 670 students. This scheme allows universities to assess applicants more holistically, and to consider their passions and attributes such as leadership, resilience or entrepreneurial skills or talent in non-academic areas. The good news is that from the next academic year onwards, NUS, Nanyang Technological University and Singapore Management University can take in more students under the Discretionary Admissions Scheme, from 10 per cent of the annual intake currently, to up to 15 per cent. This will enable more students to enter universities on the basis of their strengths and talents, beyond academic performance. There is no perfect university. What is key is to make a considered decision with the resources and information that are available to you. Your degree should help start you on the journey to where you want to go. The knowledge, experiences and opportunities in your university life should also prepare you for life beyond your degree. As a student in Singapore, you will have up to the beginning of June to decide on your offers from most of the local universities. Whatever you eventually decide on, make the most of your university experience because, for many, it will be the best time of your life.",14.32798260407875

SMU received 1,108 applications for the 45 places in the course, which means about 25 students are vying for every place. The demand for the new course has also led to a rise in total number of applications - 14,000 in all this year, a 6 per cent rise over last year. Earlier this year, when SMU announced the new course, its officials likened it to Oxford University's prestigious politics, philosophy and economics course. It is aimed at giving students a broad understanding of how the world works and will prepare them for a range of careers. Students who had applied for the course said it is an unusual combination since it includes the study of law with economics and politics - and prestigious to boot as it is being offered to only a select group of high-calibre students. Many were also drawn by the fact that the course would prepare them for a wide range of jobs, including in journalism, foreign affairs, public service, consulting and research. SMU provost Lily Kong said she was delighted with the response. She added: ""From all our engagement sessions, it is clear that students, parents and employers recognise the value that the PLE combination of disciplines can bring in preparing graduates who can handle multifaceted careers... ""Through a deeper understanding of how politics, law and economics intersect to shape the world in which we live, we hope to groom a new generation of leaders and thinkers for Singapore."" The 45 students selected for the course will take all three subjects in the first year, before specialising in one of four areas - global studies, distribution and justice, public policy and governance, or choice and behaviour - from year two. Students will also have to go on a 10-week internship during which they will work on a project to find solutions to a real-world problem. SMU said several firms have indicated their interest in offering internships to those on the course. They include the Economic Development Board as well as consultancies like Bain and Company. SMU officials said close to 5,000 of the 14,000 applicants have been shortlisted so far. They will be further assessed via interviews. Professor Kong said that, besides academic results, SMU uses other criteria for admission. ""Exam grades are a valid measure, but they cannot be the sole measure of a student's ability."" The university is the first in Singapore to require all [shortlisted] candidates to attend an interview. It started the practice 16 years ago, when 2,000 students applied to become part of its pioneer batch. Interviews are still required now, although the number of candidates shortlisted for the six undergraduate degree courses has trebled. They are conducted individually or in groups, with professors on the lookout for intellectual curiosity and leadership qualities. SMU said a select group of students - about 1,000 - with strong academic and other abilities were invited to visit the university on ""SMU Discovery Day"" this year. Prof Kong said: ""Our engagement is directed at confirming that they are indeed an excellent match for the education that SMU offers, and for them to confirm that SMU is the university of choice for them.""

Describe yourself. 2. Why do you think we should accept you? How can you contribute to NTU? 3. Did you apply in other Universities as well?Probing Questions 1. Describe yourself in 2 sentences. [Stress Test -1] 2. Describe yourself in only 3 words. [Stress Test -1] 3. Which community areas did you serve? [Probing CCAs & Interests -2] 4. Why didn't you apply for Humanities & Social Studies instead? [Probing CCAs & Interests -2] 5. Why do you still want to choose NTU instead of NUS? [Universities Choice -3] Below are just my opinions. The interview ended surprisingly faster than expected - far less than 10 minutes. However, there were no questions related to assess my competency for ACBS, and I guess that these questions are completely the same as single degree interview. Also, I doubt they even know what I actually applied for. So for those who are applying ACBS as well, do rest assure.  Comparing NTU and SMU, I find that NTU is more rigid in the way they conduct their interviews. They seem to have a list of standardized questions to be asked. Whereas for SMU, after I spoken about my attachment in one of the Big 4, the whole conversation was all about the work I did, and how I was able to cope with stress in the environment. Very friendly professors. As such, it is much easier to control your conversation topic for SMU. Again, in my opinion, NTU is more interested in how you can contribute to NTU. Whilst for SMU, the professors really want to know you as an individual. Also, the interviewers in NTU seem to be expressionless; it feels that I was talking to robots, but at the very least they did hold eye contact with me. Both are equally efficient in conducting their interviews nevertheless. Generally agree with Aomatsu.  Just to add on, I went for the ACBS interview back in 2014, because, you know, NS, and the main interviewer was Prof Valerie. We had a rather entertaining conversation and it was more of a chit-chat session than an interview. NTU knows what courses you applied for. She had my application form in hard copy on the table (in full view) and asked me why I applied for REP as my 2nd choice, and only put Accountancy (single degree) as the 3rd choice. Other than that, the main focus was definitely on how I would contribute NTU if they offered me a place/scholarship. Of course I talked about joining some clubs in NBS, my career goals and the various competitions/events at NTU which interest me. They didn't ask me those ""essay"" kind of questions though, but we chatted for around 20 minutes. It was a very light-hearted and enjoyable session and it felt really short in fact. After the interview, the prof invited me to apply for the USP. I also went for the SMU interview (also in 2014) for the double degree programme in Accountancy and Business. I remember being interviewed by Prof Seow and Prof Gary Pan. They seemed really concerned about whether I applied to NUS/NTU and asked me which I would pick if I was offered all 3. It somehow gave me the impression that they were being insecure/desperate. However, I liked the fact that they gave more attention to my hobbies and interests and focused less on academic achievements. I guess this is one example of SMU's holistic admissions process. They were also constantly marketing their school throughout the interview by asking me if I knew that their school of accountancy was ranked xxx in the BYU rankings etc, and kept comparing them to the other 2 unis. What I got out of that interview was that the profs at SMU are really passionate about what they do and that they're incredibly driven especially when it comes to building the school's reputation.  At the end of the day, both are local universities. Employers will lump NUS/NTU/SMU together anyway. So in terms of employability, no difference really. Choose the school which suits your personality better.",12.68749353654616

Ntu comms - Far from my place (about 1.5h) which means I gotta stay in hall for the first year and waste a lot of time travelling for subsequent years - It's a known fact that comms students are very loud and quite bitchy too (correct me if I'm wrong) - Communications complements my diploma (marketing) and enables me to do marketing communications or digital marketing in future. Heard that wkwsci teaches a lot of technical skills such as illustrator and video editing which I feel is more helpful for my future career. - Ranking wise, very good. Wkwsci is first in Asia and 6th in the world. Ntu is also ranked 13th in the world so easier for me to apply for masters in a prestigious UK/US uni I guess. - A bit worried that I would lose out to mass comm students who have background in poly... I would pick a course with lower project weightage since exams are my forte. However, I do not know the weightage for both courses. Anyone knows?

To deviate, the skills i find seriously lacking in some candidates today are multicultural literacy and global awareness, as well as the ability to work with people uniquely different from them.

2016,National University of Singapore|nus|computer|com|infosys|information systems|analytics|smart city,Curriculum|Curriculumn|courses|modules|pedagogy,"Which university? Which course of study?Aim for a course that best suits you, rather than enrol in the most lucrative one Tan Eng Chye Prof Tan is deputy president (academic affairs) and provost at the National University of Singapore. PUBLISHED 6 HOURS AGOhttp://www.straitstimes.com/singapor...ourse-of-study The university admissions season is in full swing, and this is an exciting time for students in Singapore. The tertiary education landscape here has expanded significantly, and there are now many varied and interesting pathways for students to choose from, from traditional professional degree courses in medicine or engineering, to music and the liberal arts and science. Many parents I met at the National University of Singapore's (NUS) Open Day last month remarked that they are envious of the plethora of choices their children have, and wish to be young once more. Some of you may have secured multiple offers from different universities in Singapore and overseas, and you will have to make an acceptance decision soon. But how should one decide? Every year, the Ministry of Education publishes the employment rates and median starting salaries of fresh graduates of the different degree programmes offered by local universities. I certainly hope students do not make decisions based solely on data obtained through the Graduate Employment Survey (GES). GES data provides an indication of starting salaries. Starting salaries are but a guide; they neither set the course nor determine one's career trajectory or destiny. In this volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous or ""Vuca"" world, one cannot predict the future or where the lucrative jobs will be. You would therefore want your university education to equip you with broad-based life skills, and develop you with the flexibility and resilience needed to pick up new knowledge, adapt to new circumstances, and exploit job opportunities across a variety of sectors throughout your lifetime of careers. Another consideration is whether and how the university course adds value to your educational journey. Some students (and parents) may look to university rankings as a measure of the strength of a university department. And there are definitely synergies between research and education. If the university department excels in research, and counts world-leading researchers in the field, it is likely that cutting-edge research will filter through to your learning experience. You will have the opportunity to be taught by highly regarded academics, and there will be plenty of opportunities to conduct research under the who's-who in the field. This is particularly valuable if you have a very strong interest in research or academia. Choosing a university that excels in your area of interest may also open up more specialised opportunities, such as advanced facilities, academic opportunities such as overseas study or research trips, as well as internships and employment opportunities with prestigious organisations in the industry. Beyond academic reputation, your choice of university will also affect your life intellectually, socially and professionally. You should evaluate the entire student experience, and whether it will suit you. Find out if the social setting on campus is what you would want to be part of. NUS has, for example, the Yale-NUS College and the University Town Residential College programmes, which offer an integrated living and learning experience, amid a collegial and intellectually vibrant setting. Another distinctive programme is the NUS Overseas Colleges programme, where students get to live, work and study in an entrepreneurial hub such as Silicon Valley, New York City or Stockholm, taking entrepreneurship classes at a partner university while working in promising entrepreneurial start-ups. All universities have carefully developed their own suite of programmes and it is worth your time and effort to find out what is on offer. Talk to the professors, and to current students. Universities hold Open Days and various outreach sessions where you can visit the campus and get first-hand information. The best-ranked university or the programme that offers you two degrees in the shortest duration may sound attractive, but they may not necessarily be what you are looking for.  Some of you may want an intensely academic experience, and to pick up as many degrees in the shortest possible time. Yet others may prefer to develop a broader range of capabilities, to try out new things, or to pursue more varied experiences. You should aim to identify a university and a course that best suits you, and not simply enrol in the most competitive or lucrative course. After all, you will be spending your next three to four years in this programme. For those of you whose grades may not meet the degree programme's published entry requirements, do not give up. All local universities have discretionary admissions schemes. Last year, NUS interviewed a record 1,600 students under the scheme, and admitted 670 students. This scheme allows universities to assess applicants more holistically, and to consider their passions and attributes such as leadership, resilience or entrepreneurial skills or talent in non-academic areas. The good news is that from the next academic year onwards, NUS, Nanyang Technological University and Singapore Management University can take in more students under the Discretionary Admissions Scheme, from 10 per cent of the annual intake currently, to up to 15 per cent. This will enable more students to enter universities on the basis of their strengths and talents, beyond academic performance. There is no perfect university. What is key is to make a considered decision with the resources and information that are available to you. Your degree should help start you on the journey to where you want to go. The knowledge, experiences and opportunities in your university life should also prepare you for life beyond your degree. As a student in Singapore, you will have up to the beginning of June to decide on your offers from most of the local universities. Whatever you eventually decide on, make the most of your university experience because, for many, it will be the best time of your life.",15.272653961775312

2016,National University of Singapore|nus|computer|com|infosys|information systems|analytics|smart city,Curriculum|Curriculumn|courses|modules|pedagogy,"DISCLAIMER: I'd like to say that this post is not meant to flame anyone or put a negative spotlight on anyone. The examples I highlighted below are simply the comments/questions that I spotted which inspired me to write this. I wouldn't want to start a discussion about education in Singapore here, nor would this a debate for JC vs Poly. Just a little background about myself - I was a comms student in poly, did pretty average for my GPA (3.5x), missed the uni application in my first year of army, got rejected by NTU ADM last year, finally got a late acceptance letter from ADM this year. So trust me when I say I can empathise with those who are still waiting for their acceptance letter, and why some people are asking certain questions here.Spoiler!Hi guys, care to give your opinions and views on SMU Business VS NUS Statistics?  Which one will have higher demand by employers? The answer to this is simple, ask yourself where do you want to work? MNC? Local startup? The big 4? Starting your own business? Government sector? The 'value' of a degree is only given to by the people looking at it. Even then, there are those companies in each category that would defy the stereotypical hiring policy. So my advice to the poster who asked this question is to define who are your said 'employers' first. If you have no idea where you want to work or which sector of business you want to be in, it might serve you better to understand more about the course to see which specific programme/school/school culture might suit you better rather which degree appeals more to 'employers'. It's better to make an informed choice yourself.Spoiler!Actually, people do look at where you study. I got a couple of friends in HR. They told me that they would also look at the university, course, GPA/grades, modules taken, then any leadership roles regardless of how many years of relevant work experience a person has. Some say they tend to give more priority to old boys/girls, alum, that sort of thing. I'm not saying you're wrong here buddy, and in fact you're correct in saying this! But like I mentioned previously, it depends on where you're applying for work at, what is the company's hiring policy, what are they looking for etc. Comments like this might mislead some to think that this one degree/choice of school will make or break their future. What your friends experienced are the hiring policies of their particular companies they work at, but it's definitely not the same across various companies.There's no 'one size fits all' answer to certain questions. There is also no 'only one single path' to success. Some students don't realise it yet. This is the point that I'm driving at - Students should not be afraid to seek out multiple answers to a single question. There is always more than one way to solve a single question. Isn't that how it is for Math too? There may be one solution given in the answer book but it doesn't mean that that's the only one.If you do not get your university placing in the public schools this year, there are many other options! For poly students, you can take a gap year and work first, try again next year or the year after, like what I was planning to do myself should I not get my placing this year. Work experience ain't a bad idea too. For JC students, you can always take the A's again (like what some here are planning to do), to get a better grade for your dream course on the next application. I had a friend who couldn't get pharmaceutical, retook his A's while serving NS, scored a much better grade and went on to pharmaceutical on a scholarship in the end. If you really want to study this year, then private schools might be a viable idea as well. Yes things might not have gone according to plan for you. You might have been taught your whole life that you must get into NTU/NUS/SMU, or that might have been pressure on yourself. But fact is, if you're not getting in (even after appeal), then it's on you to take your next step forward. You have to keep moving forward in life despite the obstacles you face. If you're really rejected in the end, allow yourself to be sad for a little while, then pick yourself up, make plans, take the next step forward and move on. You might have to take a little detour, but it doesn't mean you can't get there. It's just how badly you want it. I hope this lengthy post written at 3am in the morning would encourage some of you even a little, because I know what it's like to constantly fail at every turn and have life keep pushing you down. If it did, then I'm glad. ",14.086601122619493

SMU received 1,108 applications for the 45 places in the course, which means about 25 students are vying for every place. The demand for the new course has also led to a rise in total number of applications - 14,000 in all this year, a 6 per cent rise over last year. Earlier this year, when SMU announced the new course, its officials likened it to Oxford University's prestigious politics, philosophy and economics course. It is aimed at giving students a broad understanding of how the world works and will prepare them for a range of careers. Students who had applied for the course said it is an unusual combination since it includes the study of law with economics and politics - and prestigious to boot as it is being offered to only a select group of high-calibre students. Many were also drawn by the fact that the course would prepare them for a wide range of jobs, including in journalism, foreign affairs, public service, consulting and research. SMU provost Lily Kong said she was delighted with the response. She added: ""From all our engagement sessions, it is clear that students, parents and employers recognise the value that the PLE combination of disciplines can bring in preparing graduates who can handle multifaceted careers... ""Through a deeper understanding of how politics, law and economics intersect to shape the world in which we live, we hope to groom a new generation of leaders and thinkers for Singapore."" The 45 students selected for the course will take all three subjects in the first year, before specialising in one of four areas - global studies, distribution and justice, public policy and governance, or choice and behaviour - from year two. Students will also have to go on a 10-week internship during which they will work on a project to find solutions to a real-world problem. SMU said several firms have indicated their interest in offering internships to those on the course. They include the Economic Development Board as well as consultancies like Bain and Company. SMU officials said close to 5,000 of the 14,000 applicants have been shortlisted so far. They will be further assessed via interviews. Professor Kong said that, besides academic results, SMU uses other criteria for admission. ""Exam grades are a valid measure, but they cannot be the sole measure of a student's ability."" The university is the first in Singapore to require all [shortlisted] candidates to attend an interview. It started the practice 16 years ago, when 2,000 students applied to become part of its pioneer batch. Interviews are still required now, although the number of candidates shortlisted for the six undergraduate degree courses has trebled. They are conducted individually or in groups, with professors on the lookout for intellectual curiosity and leadership qualities. SMU said a select group of students - about 1,000 - with strong academic and other abilities were invited to visit the university on ""SMU Discovery Day"" this year. Prof Kong said: ""Our engagement is directed at confirming that they are indeed an excellent match for the education that SMU offers, and for them to confirm that SMU is the university of choice for them."" A-level holder Benedict Lim, 20, who applied for the PLE course, said: ""I have an interest in both (law and economics) and had a hard time picking one, so when I heard about SMU's new course, I jumped at the chance."" He is keen on a broad-based education as he believes it will train him to be versatile and adaptable and enable him to switch careers. ""You know what they say about students having to take on jobs that don't exist today. ""I really do believe that. That's why it is best to have a broad-based education, so that you have a broad understanding of issues and how the world works.""

Comparing NTU and SMU, I find that NTU is more rigid in the way they conduct their interviews. They seem to have a list of standardized questions to be asked. Whereas for SMU, after I spoken about my attachment in one of the Big 4, the whole conversation was all about the work I did, and how I was able to cope with stress in the environment. Very friendly professors. As such, it is much easier to control your conversation topic for SMU. Again, in my opinion, NTU is more interested in how you can contribute to NTU. Whilst for SMU, the professors really want to know you as an individual. Also, the interviewers in NTU seem to be expressionless; it feels that I was talking to robots, but at the very least they did hold eye contact with me. Both are equally efficient in conducting their interviews nevertheless. Generally agree with Aomatsu.  Just to add on, I went for the ACBS interview back in 2014, because, you know, NS, and the main interviewer was Prof Valerie. We had a rather entertaining conversation and it was more of a chit-chat session than an interview. NTU knows what courses you applied for. She had my application form in hard copy on the table (in full view) and asked me why I applied for REP as my 2nd choice, and only put Accountancy (single degree) as the 3rd choice. Other than that, the main focus was definitely on how I would contribute NTU if they offered me a place/scholarship. Of course I talked about joining some clubs in NBS, my career goals and the various competitions/events at NTU which interest me. They didn't ask me those ""essay"" kind of questions though, but we chatted for around 20 minutes. It was a very light-hearted and enjoyable session and it felt really short in fact. After the interview, the prof invited me to apply for the USP. I also went for the SMU interview (also in 2014) for the double degree programme in Accountancy and Business. I remember being interviewed by Prof Seow and Prof Gary Pan. They seemed really concerned about whether I applied to NUS/NTU and asked me which I would pick if I was offered all 3. It somehow gave me the impression that they were being insecure/desperate. However, I liked the fact that they gave more attention to my hobbies and interests and focused less on academic achievements. I guess this is one example of SMU's holistic admissions process. They were also constantly marketing their school throughout the interview by asking me if I knew that their school of accountancy was ranked xxx in the BYU rankings etc, and kept comparing them to the other 2 unis. What I got out of that interview was that the profs at SMU are really passionate about what they do and that they're incredibly driven especially when it comes to building the school's reputation.  At the end of the day, both are local universities. Employers will lump NUS/NTU/SMU together anyway. So in terms of employability, no difference really. Choose the school which suits your personality better.",12.81889686435865

SMU received 1,108 applications for the 45 places in the course, which means about 25 students are vying for every place. The demand for the new course has also led to a rise in total number of applications - 14,000 in all this year, a 6 per cent rise over last year. Earlier this year, when SMU announced the new course, its officials likened it to Oxford University's prestigious politics, philosophy and economics course. It is aimed at giving students a broad understanding of how the world works and will prepare them for a range of careers. Students who had applied for the course said it is an unusual combination since it includes the study of law with economics and politics - and prestigious to boot as it is being offered to only a select group of high-calibre students. Many were also drawn by the fact that the course would prepare them for a wide range of jobs, including in journalism, foreign affairs, public service, consulting and research. SMU provost Lily Kong said she was delighted with the response. She added: ""From all our engagement sessions, it is clear that students, parents and employers recognise the value that the PLE combination of disciplines can bring in preparing graduates who can handle multifaceted careers... ""Through a deeper understanding of how politics, law and economics intersect to shape the world in which we live, we hope to groom a new generation of leaders and thinkers for Singapore."" The 45 students selected for the course will take all three subjects in the first year, before specialising in one of four areas - global studies, distribution and justice, public policy and governance, or choice and behaviour - from year two. Students will also have to go on a 10-week internship during which they will work on a project to find solutions to a real-world problem. SMU said several firms have indicated their interest in offering internships to those on the course. They include the Economic Development Board as well as consultancies like Bain and Company. SMU officials said close to 5,000 of the 14,000 applicants have been shortlisted so far. They will be further assessed via interviews. Professor Kong said that, besides academic results, SMU uses other criteria for admission. ""Exam grades are a valid measure, but they cannot be the sole measure of a student's ability."" The university is the first in Singapore to require all [shortlisted] candidates to attend an interview. It started the practice 16 years ago, when 2,000 students applied to become part of its pioneer batch. Interviews are still required now, although the number of candidates shortlisted for the six undergraduate degree courses has trebled. They are conducted individually or in groups, with professors on the lookout for intellectual curiosity and leadership qualities. SMU said a select group of students - about 1,000 - with strong academic and other abilities were invited to visit the university on ""SMU Discovery Day"" this year.

I did not do the Singapore A levels but instead studied at an Indian School, here in Singapore. The curriculum I did is a reputed one actually, and NUS only needs my Year 12 results, and not any other exams like SAT, TOEFL etc. My year 12 (equivalent to A levels) grades are good. But, I think you can judge my grades too! Here are my grades, remember the maximum score for each subject is 100! English - 90 ; Math - 92 ; Chem - 88 ; Bio - 86 ; Phy -78 (physics score is bad)  (In the NUS admissions website, it says that the admission committee wants either Bio/Phy..since my bio is better would that be taken into consideration?) So do you think I stand a chance for dentistry? I have volunteer experience at the Science Centre, and have won prizes from two International Essay competitions! I am also a member of Mensa Singapore (High IQ society)! I am extremely passionate about becoming a dentist one day!! Thank you for reading this guys, and expecting your replies soon! The jury is out regarding the comparability of your ""reputed"" qualifications with the Cambridge A levels and whether your superior Biology score will take precedence over your Physics score. One can only presume a good admissions process to consider all facets of a candidate, not cherry picking only the scores which put said candidate in the best possible light. As a side point, I would like to add that the admission of a permanent resident into the Dentistry course is unheard of -- at least in my circle. For the Medicine course I believe there are but a handful of PRs every cohort (3-5). If this ratio is anything to go by, go figure for Dentistry. One pointer though, please do not parade your Mensa membership as though as it were a feather in your cap worthy of excessive display. Doubtless, entry into this select group is contingent upon your god-given faculties, however it in no way displays your conviction, perservance or aptitude for a dentistry course beyond the fact that you are able to make two and two of a logical problem with greater ease than your non-Mensa brethren. Strutting a Mensa badge of honour has lost its awe the same way the prestige of having the word ""Harvard"" haughtily emblazoned across your chest has been lost when people found out it really mean nothing, what with Harvard tees available en masse in online stores of every stripe and colour. Sorry if this paragraph about Mensa came on a little too strong but these are my personal feelings towards this matter, feelings which I'm sure are harboured by not just my person. Ultimately, what I and the other contributors on this forum provide are but speculations; they may, through serendipity, hit the bullseye, or they may only be the daydreams of delusional individuals disguised as sound advice. Chances are, the latter is likely to be true. Bear in mind that only someone from the NUS admissions office is able to provide any semblance of a true answer.

2017,National University of Singapore|nus|computer|com|infosys|information systems|analytics|smart city,interview|Discretionary|aptitude|Scholarship,"Hi all,  Signing up for an account and posting for the first time as this thread has given me a lot of information and insight into the whole application process.  Actually I have been reading the past few years' threads as well only to realise how I must really buck up on my GPA and thanks to the realisation of how difficult it is to get into uni, I eventually managed to pull up my grades, with lots of stress of course.  Would like to contribute what I can:  Local, CPGA 3.64, 4 sem GPA 3.53, LIR4 10? or 12? Can't really remember.  Applied to:  NUS FASS - application STILL processing NTU HSS - offered third choice Linguistics based on 4 sems, will appeal for PPGA or Sociology  SMU Social Science - application STILL processing  For those wondering, I could only apply with my 4 semesters as my internship was on my 5th semester, so no 5th sem results. For NUS and SMU, they have made it clear to me at the many times I asked that they will not be making a decision based on 4 semesters if I don't meet the cut-off and will wait for the full transcript. As for NTU, their policy is to process with 4 semesters anyway and will make decision based on it.  Thankfully, my 4-semesters GPA somehow got me an interview with Linguistics. I was called up in early April, went for the writing test and interview, and got offered 2 days after my interview. When I went, two girls I spoke to both did not put Linguistics as their first choice. I believe most in the room (about 7 of us) possibly also did not do so and they were processing applications pushed down from other courses.  Just like to ask a few things I didn't see answers for despite stalking this thread quite religiously:  1) Those who got rejected - you guys got explicit rejection letters via email?  2) Those who got FASS interview and writing test - may I know what is it about? I am still hoping to DA into FASS but up till now no calls, pretty much nothing.  3) For the NTU appeal, should I write about how I have improved a lot and actually qualify for both PPGA and Soci with my 6-sems or focus on why I want to tranfer into these courses instead? Also, do you appeal specifically into one course or do they just assume you are appealing for whatever courses you didn't get?  4) Anyone applied for CAPT and have gone for the interview already?  As for DA: I did not have a CCA in school but I actively volunteered outside of school and did take on one very big role in one of the biggest community events in SG. Its way above the average amount that students would volunteer so I am hopeful yet at the same time not expectant. Have not seen a case of someone admitted via DA for community service.  I do think that my application remains processing for both NUS and SMU due to the fact that I am very borderline plus my DA is via community service. They have much better applicants to offer to but I am just praying very hard that at the end of this waiting game is good news.  Some other info that may help:  SMU is appearing to be very generous with their Biz Ad interviews this year as I know 3 people with GPAs ranging from 3.5-3.6 being offered interviews, aka already one step in if they don't screw up the interview. Could help that they come from related courses but I hope this give others in the same shoe some hope! No news is good news!  Cheers everybody! I like the positive vibes going on for the NTU appeals. Hope everybody eventually get to where they belong! ",13.52799363986517

He just has higher expectations than the general populace when it comes to retaking A levels. Yes,he might not have gotten crappy results,but I can offer an alternative side of the story since I known him during my JC days. During my JC days,I didn't know louie till J2,when my friend invited him over to join us for a game of badminton on a Saturday in our JC. Back then, I only knew louie as being one of the best in maths/chem in my JC and he did well for that in his first A levels,so I was amazed that he was considering of retaking A's  with his results during NS(1yr my senior). He later,told me that he wasn't satisfied with his A levels results,as he hopes to get into pharmacy in NUS.  I lost contact with him,till I finished NS and I was surprised to learn that he took a gap yr after his NS,to volunteer in hospitals and also retake the A levels. I guess at this point of time,girls should be able to empathise with him at the very least,since he went through an extra yr after NS to re-do his A's. In fact,he told me his plans to re-take As this yr,but I advised him not to and to apply for university instead,since it's counter-intuitive to not go into uni,given his financial circumstances.(He can't consider overseas) Though he didn't get to pharmacy(I guess it's pharmacy's loss to not accept him), he got into nanyang scholarship programme,after all the efforts invested. I feel it's a valiant effort,coming from someone who didn't have any tuition,academic guidance during his period of retakes and still managed to make unconventional decisions(that might not seem logical to the majority) that guaranteed his success. Don't judge the book by it's cover,is all I have to say,to anyone who doubts that he doesn't experience emotional pain after each admission cycle. Emotional pain after each admission cycle? This is weird, anyone who did worse than him is suffering worse than him during the admission cycle. He did well to qualify for 95% of the courses in local university, but he is just being bent on getting into Pharmacy.  What Eddie previously meant that Louie was not the most suited person to share his experience about a success story from past failures. An example of a ''real success story'' would be middleofnowhere. He has already been performing extremely well in school, as well in A Levels. But in terms of providing advice to students who are retaking A levels (because they have failed), he will not be able to provide helpful advice. It is not a loss that Pharmacy did not accept him, but he did not fulfil the requirements set by the administration. You mentioned it as a courageous effort of him to retake A levels countless of time despite his financial difficulties, no tuition, etc. But, bear in mind, is he can choose not to retake A levels 4 times and enter Uni straight after NS, but he chose not to. He chose merely because he is obsessed into getting the course he wished to enter. Frankly speaking, from your entire paragraph, what are you trying to conclude? You kept harping on the fact that he retook A levels as if he has no choice, difficult economic situations, people must empathise him, he is really bold in making such decisions, etc.. But, you must not be biased in your opinions just because he is your classmate. I mean, also do clarify what emotional pain that he has to undergo? Being not able to enter Pharmacy, despite having tons of other choices waiting for him to choose from? There are many people out there with so little options to choose from, their emotional pain is far much worse than what he is facing.. Nevertheless, it is great that he finally resigned to his fate and know that he has a slim chance into entering Pharmacy. He should have done that 2 years back, and not clinging on to the hope that he can enter Pharmacy one day. If he had entered any course 2 years back, he can graduate earlier and support his family earlier.",12.697765025026012

One can only presume a good admissions process to consider all facets of a candidate, not cherry picking only the scores which put said candidate in the best possible light. As a side point, I would like to add that the admission of a permanent resident into the Dentistry course is unheard of -- at least in my circle. For the Medicine course I believe there are but a handful of PRs every cohort (3-5). If this ratio is anything to go by, go figure for Dentistry. One pointer though, please do not parade your Mensa membership as though as it were a feather in your cap worthy of excessive display. Doubtless, entry into this select group is contingent upon your god-given faculties, however it in no way displays your conviction, perservance or aptitude for a dentistry course beyond the fact that you are able to make two and two of a logical problem with greater ease than your non-Mensa brethren. Strutting a Mensa badge of honour has lost its awe the same way the prestige of having the word ""Harvard"" haughtily emblazoned across your chest has been lost when people found out it really mean nothing, what with Harvard tees available en masse in online stores of every stripe and colour. Sorry if this paragraph about Mensa came on a little too strong but these are my personal feelings towards this matter, feelings which I'm sure are harboured by not just my person. Ultimately, what I and the other contributors on this forum provide are but speculations; they may, through serendipity, hit the bullseye, or they may only be the daydreams of delusional individuals disguised as sound advice. Chances are, the latter is likely to be true. Bear in mind that only someone from the NUS admissions office is able to provide any semblance of a true answer.

I'm actually currently an ITE (going to be graduating soon) student that's looking on to which polytechnics I should advance on and then subsequently, I intend on going to Uni to do a degree. While I think the PBL-pedagogy is great I would prefer something old school perhaps like at SP, NYP or maybe even NP. I would be okay with joining any of their generalised Business Diplomas, but because my lecturers here at ITE have been telling me to go to RP supposedly (""for increased chances to get top student and go to Uni"") hence that was where I was going with my original question on RP students who are mainly from R48, R52- what were their odds on advancing to University. Ultimately, I do not want to jeopardise my chances of getting to Uni if I go to RP, because I think even tho there are some benefits about PBL- the Big3 Unis still have some doubts & stigma about the learning style there at RP. At least that's what I heard when I talked to my lecturers.  Idk about you but I feel RP's Business or ""Management"" courses feels really lackluster in terms of what they cover unlike other Polys which offer dual specialisation options. Some of these which one can maybe even use in Uni? I would love to hear your thoughts. Thanks for the reply! I am from that prestigious poly with a motto in Malay ""Berkhidmat dengan Keahlian"". Lots of hype, smoke and mirror ... despite my academic excellence there. Still, I really believe that I am disadvantaged in life without PBL.  With regards to your concern, just concentrate on getting into a poly from ITE and let time dictate the outcome towards university. After all, it really ""is the singer not the song"". Meaning that if you excel in whatever you put your heart and mind to, the place you did it doesn't matter. Nothing can block your progress. You will then be positioned to do what you want to do. Not what you need to do. Like so many poor souls in this forum.  Be in the position where all university invites you to apply for priority (aka early) admission and lay out the 'red carpets' of talks, open house, individualised chats with professors, private group tours of labs, scholarship offers, etc. Be flagged by their admission scouts.

Still don't regret choosing my subject combi though, I lost in terms of grades but gained a lot in experience and found my passion too.  Unfortunately it's hard to grade fairly because all of us are different and talented in our own ways, it's just that a uni degree is still considered so sacred among some people and is generally required for higher paying jobs, that people who do not take the academic route are looked down upon.  I do know a few people who went to poly despite qualifying for the top JCs and even IB, and a few who went to poly after 4 years in IP. Traditionally, people who don't do well for Os naturally went to poly, I have relatives who went through that, that's probably why older generations look down on poly students. It's different now though, many people go to poly to pursue their passions even if they plan to go to uni, and I respect them for it because they do it despite knowing that it's the harder path and they're willing to work for it.  Anyway, even though some are suffering now, I believe hard work will not betray you. Keep pushing and one day all of us will be where we want to be.",11.113214589348221

Thanks so much for your reply sorry had to make you repeat  But erm I understand the merit part but my reasoning is that even though I have a merit (top 10% of graduating cohort), I don't have stellar GPA. I think this is mostly because I'm from a humanities dip which is more project based so hence more subjective in gradings. I know of friends in engineering with 3.9 GPA but no merit. So if I had a merit in let say a business course, I would have a 3.9 GPA and I believe that would give me a better shot at my course. You know what I mean? haha like there's no fair benchmark here so I tried to emphasise that a little in my appeal and requested for an interview.  I'm not from mass comm but I did talk about my experiences in marketing (i know it's slightly diff from advertising) like big scale projects and internship, as well as skills in designing, video editing etc in my personal statement (for DA) as well as appeal. I even mailed (not email lol) the dean and the programme department lol.  But I guess my chances are slim  maybe my O levels as well, didn't do very well ELR2B2 of 15. But if I had a 3.9 gpa?? Doubt that would make a diff lol. Life. Oh yes Humanities really much harder to score, but yeah glad you realise there's no fair benchmark. I think you can try to bank on your portfolio so far to give you an interview, but just don't hope so much?  Tbh speaking from my friends who were in mass comm, its already hard for them to make it into WKW, even if they meet the cut-off for poly. Not sure why but despite being a very hands-on, practical industry, they still favour JC kids more. I know an acquaintance who was offered scholarship simply because he had good A' Level results. I also have friends, who despite having a good portfolio of experience (internship with big companies, recommendation letter from their supervisors, took on side jobs related to the media), and did not manage to appeal successfully into WKW. But those who were from poly mass comm courses can get up to one year worth of exemption if I did not remember wrongly - on the provision if you get in lol.

Yes,you don't get your major straight away. The thing about NUS psychology,in particular,is that you are required to score B- for at least 2 modules to be eligible. Considering that B is the average grade in NUS,B- is  a low requirement to get into Psychology. I am sure,students taking other major modules,will close an eye to the major if they score B,let alone B-. Psychology is a degree that requires graduate school(masters/phd),in order to be work in a similar field. Hence,I believe that it's quite fair for NUS to require students to meet a certain grade to qualify for the major. Apart from that,there are so many benefits of going to NUS. You have a wider range of S/U to play around with. For e.g. you take 5 modules for first semester,you regretted taking that 1 exposure module,you can just play with the S/U. Another will be if students really know what they want in mind,they can just start their major requirements,ignoring the exposure modules.(e.g. Year 2 psychology modules in second semester after clearing the 2 modules in semester 1)  Yes,NTU allows you to start with psychology straight. However,their S/U system applies to lesser number of modules and you can only S/U before an exam. For SMU,there is no S/U system and the latin honours classification is extremely rigorous in nature. In terms of difficulty to attain,Summa cum laude>first class honours , Magna cum laude>second upper honours  cum laude>second lower honours  In terms of recognition,summa tends to be equal to first class,vice versa for the rest. It just seems so wrong to work harder for a similar honours classification. Another issue of contention for SMU,is their niche in business fields.It has an amazing business programme,but for the field of social sciences,it isn't quite as level-par if you were to compare to NUS/NTU. Especially for psychology,there is greater orientation towards research,NUS/NTU tends to stand out in providing better facilities. The only plus point of SMU is availability to go for up to a yr long of exchange programmes. The reason why I am able to state so affirmatively my views of SMU,is largely because I have a friend who is studying social sciences and currently excelling in his studies there. So the bottom line will be,to weigh your options carefully.Unless,you are considering between SMU/NTU,I think that will be a hard one,but for NUS,it is quite clear.There's a reason why NUS is the hardest to get in,compared to SMU and NTU. Thank you for your insight. I've already decided on my major though the only decision is which one to pursue: Psychology or social work though I am leaning more towards psychology since it does allow me entry into the social work field as well while keeping my options open to pursue a masters or such.",10.64490273668874

2017,National University of Singapore|nus|computer|com|infosys|information systems|analytics|smart city,salary|Exemption|career prospect|difficulty|pay,"Hi everyone, just thought that I have provide some insight into the difference between the Economics and Political Science courses in NUS and NTU, for those who have received offers from both and are facing difficulty making a decision. These observations will exclude factors of prestige, ranking, internship opportunities, salary etc so that you can make a better decision without the common biases.Economics Most students entering economics often fear the maths component, which is an integral part of the field. If you observe the modules, you would see that NTU has slightly more qualitative mods than NUS, which has more quantitative mods. For those interested in the policy and developmental part of economics, it seems that NTU may be the better option for you. Furthermore, there is direct entry for a double major in Econs + PPGA at NTU, which further benefits students by exploring the interconnectedness of both fields. NUS however has more mods that cater to different levels of learning. Their mods have different levels and parts, so that you can get as much depth as width of mods. If you are one who prefers more depth than width, NUS might be for you.Political Science Many get confuse with the term PPGA, often equating it to Political Science in general. They do display similarities but differ slightly. You see, PPGA can be said to be a subset of political science, which has fields of (1) political theory, (2) comparative politics, (3) public policy, and (4) international relations. I hope you can see where PPGA fits in now. The PPGA course, as suggested in its name, focuses on public policy, public administration and international relations. Their public administration mods are certainly in greater abundance than NUS. NTU mods also draw more of its lesson examples from SEA and Asia as compared to NUS which has mods tackling politics of western democracies as well. On the other side, NUS has more mods spread across the different subfields (although PT is still quite little as it ain't really very popular). Their array of mods is also greater compared to NTU.Bonus (SMU) Economics in SMU is highly highly quantitative. Those majoring in Econs can even take Actuarial Science as a 2nd major and you would see that the mods. If that quantitative economics and being an actuary is a career choice for you, go for SMU. Social sciences in SMU are somewhat in little amount. As compared to institutions with higher research output like NUS and NTU, the amount and variety of mods are quite little. But SMU does emphasise a lot on interdisciplinary, as the social science component, I feel, is meant to strengthen your understanding of corporate fundamentals. So it does offer the best of both worlds for those who want to be expose to business as well as social science. If academic research is your thing however, this might not be for you. However, if you are in PLE, that's a different story and I'm sure you can see why. I hope this can help some of you all make more informed decisions on the schools you want to end up in. Remember it is not just about the prestige, but the style of learning that suits/challenges you.",10.303792316886648

What she is trying to say is that the entire admissions process, even with the grades required, is skewed towards the JC kids.  Some examples: 1) Poly application window is in Feb, basically when we are busiest with our last projects in poly life (poly kids will know this as hell week), we still have to complete our application. I am not sure if it applies to every JC, but I know some JC provide guidance to their students in writing their personal statement if required. Poly - I tried to ask for help, but no one could help me lol. I even went for further ed/career guidance counselling but it seems that I know the facts and the competitiveness better than the counselor. So yes, poly is expecting poly kids to go out and work after poly. (But let's be honest - so many of us still want to move onto uni, public or private) JC kids - you all basically on holiday when expected to make an application.  2) As she mentioned - Open House AFTER our application. When I was NUS' Open Day, I went to the admissions booth to ask about something and there was an Indian father with his son from IB, also asking why is the Open House after their application. Yeah, you could say that we can still find out information on our own, call NUS to ask them about their programs if we are interested etc but aren't we just as much of an applicant and prospective student as the JC kids are... But truth is that they are still looking to recruit JC kids that's why the Open Day is so conveniently dated after their A'Level results are released. (P.S.: IB even earlier, apply in Jan) 3) Considering us based on 4 or 5 sems - NTU considered only my 4-semesters worth of results when making an offer as I could only submit 4-sems at the point of application. I am now appealing to my first choice but as all of us here know, chances are very slim. So my question is - why can't they hold onto their decisions and decide with my full cert? My final sem results literally is my entire year 3 modules because 5th sem roll over to the final sem due to FYP judging. Their explanation is for those with 5 sems, usually not much of a diff by the time 6th sem come, which I agree to some extent, but I believe if the student manage to pull up his grades enough to qualify him for the course he wants, it is doing disservice to his efforts. It is like making a decision based on your prelim results for A'Level kids. I am not complaining about how the odds are against us to begin with. I am just asking for the universities to see all applicants as equal, and given an equally fair shot at being considered. Sorry for the long wall of text - I just want to give you guys some context, which I don't think JC kids would know if not.  ((Tbh, poly kids if you all don't have a preference, there are several engineering is not that hard to go in if you don't mind. GPA 3.4? 3.5? to safely secure a place. 3.4/3.5 should be manageable if you don't slack off too much and put in effort for your assignment/projects, and study for your exams.)) Guys stop arguing here. You just need to work hard whichever path you take that's all.  For myself, I went to Poly, achieved CGPA 3.99/4.00. Doing a SMU Double Degree in Business & Accountancy now and my CGPA is 3.90/4.00 - which is Summa Cum Laude, First Class Honours. And my GPA is obviously higher than quite alot of JC/IB students in SMU, even though I'm from Poly. At the end of the day, stop whining and crying over where you came from. Whether you came from a non-privileged or privileged background, if you did not get a spot in a Local Uni you only have yourself to blame because you did not work hard enough during 'A' levels or Poly.  And Poly students, you know fully well that more spots are allocated to JC students. It's a fact. Move on with it. You know that only the top 10 - 15% of the Poly cohort gets Local Uni admissions. So what if it's not equal, the government has been pushing for an increase in no. of spots allocated to Poly students.  And so what if it's not equal? Being the top 10-15% in poly shows your immense pedigree. Same logic goes to applying for Ivy Leagues with acceptance rates of 1%, you gonna complain to them to ask them to increase their acceptance rate? Or you going to work hard to be part of that 1%? Get over it.  And don't even talk about difference in opportunities because even I wasn't born with a silver spoon myself. Wherever you come from, work hard and succeed.

Can understand the point you are trying to convey but the problem right now is that, no offence like what the person stated earlier, you guys go to poly for a diploma degree. For jc students, we went jc for a piece of a level cert in which its main purpose is to bring us to uni. No offence but poly kids are indeed ""expected"" to work after graduation. Otherwise,why go to poly when you can go jc,work ur ass off to go uni? On top of that, a level cert is ""****"" compared to a diploma cert. If you ask to be evaluated fairly, then isnt this a death sentence to alot of jc students considering sg is already so small with limited universities? Where does an a lvl cert bring you? Nowhere,cant even find a proper job that can remotely support your financial needs. Not trying to rebute you harshly.you do make sense. Just that if you look the other way, i think that it is fair to prioritise jc students over poly students.",11.393052418470552

The day you collected your O level results, it was communicated very very clearly it's going to be significantly harder for poly students to enter local universities. Nobody put a pistol on your head and forced you to take the poly route. The government stance is crystal clear, you're supposed to enter the workforce after diploma. You don't see JC students complaining that their A level cert is worthless in the workforce. I don't think we are complaining about the odds against us as many of us know right from the start that it is harder for us than JC kids. What she is trying to say is that the entire admissions process, even with the grades required, is skewed towards the JC kids.  Some examples: 1) Poly application window is in Feb, basically when we are busiest with our last projects in poly life (poly kids will know this as hell week), we still have to complete our application. I am not sure if it applies to every JC, but I know some JC provide guidance to their students in writing their personal statement if required. Poly - I tried to ask for help, but no one could help me lol. I even went for further ed/career guidance counselling but it seems that I know the facts and the competitiveness better than the counselor. So yes, poly is expecting poly kids to go out and work after poly. (But let's be honest - so many of us still want to move onto uni, public or private) JC kids - you all basically on holiday when expected to make an application.  2) As she mentioned - Open House AFTER our application. When I was NUS' Open Day, I went to the admissions booth to ask about something and there was an Indian father with his son from IB, also asking why is the Open House after their application. Yeah, you could say that we can still find out information on our own, call NUS to ask them about their programs if we are interested etc but aren't we just as much of an applicant and prospective student as the JC kids are... But truth is that they are still looking to recruit JC kids that's why the Open Day is so conveniently dated after their A'Level results are released. (P.S.: IB even earlier, apply in Jan) 3) Considering us based on 4 or 5 sems - NTU considered only my 4-semesters worth of results when making an offer as I could only submit 4-sems at the point of application.

2017,National University of Singapore|nus|computer|com|infosys|information systems|analytics|smart city,career|prospect,"Hi everyone, just thought that I have provide some insight into the difference between the Economics and Political Science courses in NUS and NTU, for those who have received offers from both and are facing difficulty making a decision. These observations will exclude factors of prestige, ranking, internship opportunities, salary etc so that you can make a better decision without the common biases.Economics Most students entering economics often fear the maths component, which is an integral part of the field. If you observe the modules, you would see that NTU has slightly more qualitative mods than NUS, which has more quantitative mods. For those interested in the policy and developmental part of economics, it seems that NTU may be the better option for you. Furthermore, there is direct entry for a double major in Econs + PPGA at NTU, which further benefits students by exploring the interconnectedness of both fields. NUS however has more mods that cater to different levels of learning. Their mods have different levels and parts, so that you can get as much depth as width of mods. If you are one who prefers more depth than width, NUS might be for you.Political Science Many get confuse with the term PPGA, often equating it to Political Science in general. They do display similarities but differ slightly. You see, PPGA can be said to be a subset of political science, which has fields of (1) political theory, (2) comparative politics, (3) public policy, and (4) international relations. I hope you can see where PPGA fits in now. The PPGA course, as suggested in its name, focuses on public policy, public administration and international relations. Their public administration mods are certainly in greater abundance than NUS. NTU mods also draw more of its lesson examples from SEA and Asia as compared to NUS which has mods tackling politics of western democracies as well. On the other side, NUS has more mods spread across the different subfields (although PT is still quite little as it ain't really very popular). Their array of mods is also greater compared to NTU.Bonus (SMU) Economics in SMU is highly highly quantitative. Those majoring in Econs can even take Actuarial Science as a 2nd major and you would see that the mods. If that quantitative economics and being an actuary is a career choice for you, go for SMU. Social sciences in SMU are somewhat in little amount. As compared to institutions with higher research output like NUS and NTU, the amount and variety of mods are quite little. But SMU does emphasise a lot on interdisciplinary, as the social science component, I feel, is meant to strengthen your understanding of corporate fundamentals. So it does offer the best of both worlds for those who want to be expose to business as well as social science. If academic research is your thing however, this might not be for you. However, if you are in PLE, that's a different story and I'm sure you can see why. I hope this can help some of you all make more informed decisions on the schools you want to end up in. Remember it is not just about the prestige, but the style of learning that suits/challenges you.",10.513215090900898

Last year igp for a lvl indicate at least an A for 10th percentile. Poly gpa wise it went up constantly over the years.  To be fair, I believe all mods in uni are difficult to a certain extent. Not to forget there is grade moderation / bell curve too.  There are multiple reason why MS employment rates are high for every year.  First, out of all 3 local uni, only NTU offer a full 4 years Maritime course. Not much direct competition from NUS or SMU (I think SMU there is a Maritime econs concentration in one of their course).  International Maritime companies will naturally source for NTU MS graduates every year.  Secondly, the course have multiple internship opportunities available for student since year 1 (MS is a small family). Some companies are willing to offer you a position prior to graduation.  For the question on declining Maritime Industry : yes, the container industry is not doing well now. However, many companies are offering management trainee programme to groom prospective talents for the booming period. The declining period of an economy cycle are usually the best time to train talents. If you are a girl, you will probably graduate in 4 years time and I believe the economy may recover by then. Guy wise, 2 years of NS + 4 years to graduate, quite safe to say you are the luckier ones  Just my 2 cents worth of opinion  Oh ya for those who are interested in MS, there will be a guaranteed exchange programme to Norway BI in year 3 sem 1  Cheers ",10.127370017093913

I did not do the Singapore A levels but instead studied at an Indian School, here in Singapore. The curriculum I did is a reputed one actually, and NUS only needs my Year 12 results, and not any other exams like SAT, TOEFL etc. My year 12 (equivalent to A levels) grades are good. But, I think you can judge my grades too! Here are my grades, remember the maximum score for each subject is 100! English - 90 ; Math - 92 ; Chem - 88 ; Bio - 86 ; Phy -78 (physics score is bad)  (In the NUS admissions website, it says that the admission committee wants either Bio/Phy..since my bio is better would that be taken into consideration?) So do you think I stand a chance for dentistry? I have volunteer experience at the Science Centre, and have won prizes from two International Essay competitions! I am also a member of Mensa Singapore (High IQ society)! I am extremely passionate about becoming a dentist one day!! Thank you for reading this guys, and expecting your replies soon! The jury is out regarding the comparability of your ""reputed"" qualifications with the Cambridge A levels and whether your superior Biology score will take precedence over your Physics score. One can only presume a good admissions process to consider all facets of a candidate, not cherry picking only the scores which put said candidate in the best possible light. As a side point, I would like to add that the admission of a permanent resident into the Dentistry course is unheard of -- at least in my circle. For the Medicine course I believe there are but a handful of PRs every cohort (3-5). If this ratio is anything to go by, go figure for Dentistry. One pointer though, please do not parade your Mensa membership as though as it were a feather in your cap worthy of excessive display. Doubtless, entry into this select group is contingent upon your god-given faculties, however it in no way displays your conviction, perservance or aptitude for a dentistry course beyond the fact that you are able to make two and two of a logical problem with greater ease than your non-Mensa brethren. Strutting a Mensa badge of honour has lost its awe the same way the prestige of having the word ""Harvard"" haughtily emblazoned across your chest has been lost when people found out it really mean nothing, what with Harvard tees available en masse in online stores of every stripe and colour.

Ultimately, what I and the other contributors on this forum provide are but speculations; they may, through serendipity, hit the bullseye, or they may only be the daydreams of delusional individuals disguised as sound advice. Chances are, the latter is likely to be true. Bear in mind that only someone from the NUS admissions office is able to provide any semblance of a true answer.

To you it may not be so, but it is pretty obvious to others in this thread that the debate you had with renshi is definitely in a way, not civil.

All students enrolling in NTU academic programmes that lead to the award of a degree must matriculate with the University before commencing their studies. A person's status as a matriculated student will cease when he completes his study and is conferred his degree, or if he opts to withdraw from his study, or when his candidature is terminated by the University. Matriculation carries with it the agreement to abide by University rules and regulations, and codes of conduct.

Actually I have been reading the past few years' threads as well only to realise how I must really buck up on my GPA and thanks to the realisation of how difficult it is to get into uni, I eventually managed to pull up my grades, with lots of stress of course.  Would like to contribute what I can:  Local, CPGA 3.64, 4 sem GPA 3.53, LIR4 10? or 12? Can't really remember.  Applied to:  NUS FASS - application STILL processing NTU HSS - offered third choice Linguistics based on 4 sems, will appeal for PPGA or Sociology  SMU Social Science - application STILL processing  For those wondering, I could only apply with my 4 semesters as my internship was on my 5th semester, so no 5th sem results. For NUS and SMU, they have made it clear to me at the many times I asked that they will not be making a decision based on 4 semesters if I don't meet the cut-off and will wait for the full transcript. As for NTU, their policy is to process with 4 semesters anyway and will make decision based on it.  Thankfully, my 4-semesters GPA somehow got me an interview with Linguistics. I was called up in early April, went for the writing test and interview, and got offered 2 days after my interview. When I went, two girls I spoke to both did not put Linguistics as their first choice. I believe most in the room (about 7 of us) possibly also did not do so and they were processing applications pushed down from other courses.  Just like to ask a few things I didn't see answers for despite stalking this thread quite religiously:  1) Those who got rejected - you guys got explicit rejection letters via email?  2) Those who got FASS interview and writing test - may I know what is it about? I am still hoping to DA into FASS but up till now no calls, pretty much nothing.  3) For the NTU appeal, should I write about how I have improved a lot and actually qualify for both PPGA and Soci with my 6-sems or focus on why I want to tranfer into these courses instead? Also, do you appeal specifically into one course or do they just assume you are appealing for whatever courses you didn't get?  4) Anyone applied for CAPT and have gone for the interview already?  As for DA: I did not have a CCA in school but I actively volunteered outside of school and did take on one very big role in one of the biggest community events in SG. Its way above the average amount that students would volunteer so I am hopeful yet at the same time not expectant. Have not seen a case of someone admitted via DA for community service.  I do think that my application remains processing for both NUS and SMU due to the fact that I am very borderline plus my DA is via community service. They have much better applicants to offer to but I am just praying very hard that at the end of this waiting game is good news.  Some other info that may help:  SMU is appearing to be very generous with their Biz Ad interviews this year as I know 3 people with GPAs ranging from 3.5-3.6 being offered interviews, aka already one step in if they don't screw up the interview. Could help that they come from related courses but I hope this give others in the same shoe some hope! No news is good news!  Cheers everybody! I like the positive vibes going on for the NTU appeals. Hope everybody eventually get to where they belong! ",13.599527222154236

By Mr. Davidktw.  23/03/2012. ================================================= Both NTU and NUS Computing is Good if you are a good student. I don't believe in any local university offer particularly better courses. I graduated from NUS SOC and is a Senior Consultant in a local IT firm on web applications and security deployments. I also full time *nix user from Linux to Mac to Hp UX to Solaris. I don't believe NUS Computer Engineering students are any better or worse, but I do agree their courses are designed to gear towards a different sector in computing such as embedding systems and silicon design from Intel, AMD etc and semiconductors fabrication. But nothing is stopping them from taking more SoC 3rd/$th year modules. Same goes for SoC, you can also opt for engineer modules like I took a year 1 module from mechanical engineer and it still benefit me today even though my work doesn't rely on it. I do Arduino programming and also Solidworks design for my friend. So don't be mistaken that anyone tell you that it is better in any local university. That's my opinion. How much you can benefit from the lectures and tutorial is up to your own initiative. If you are passionate about Computing, then you will be interested to learn more even without lecturers and tutors. The courses merely scratches the surface on the relevant discipline, your work is to do your own research and be passionate about what you want to achieve in the near future. Find something you are good in and improve on that aspect. Google is your good friend, relevant forums is your playground, and tertiary university is your incubator. With 3/4 years there, learn what is taught and venture on your own to go in-depth. Get yourself those internship available to get a taste of the industry standard. These are not taught in universities and only through training on the job.

What she is trying to say is that the entire admissions process, even with the grades required, is skewed towards the JC kids.  Some examples: 1) Poly application window is in Feb, basically when we are busiest with our last projects in poly life (poly kids will know this as hell week), we still have to complete our application. I am not sure if it applies to every JC, but I know some JC provide guidance to their students in writing their personal statement if required. Poly - I tried to ask for help, but no one could help me lol. I even went for further ed/career guidance counselling but it seems that I know the facts and the competitiveness better than the counselor. So yes, poly is expecting poly kids to go out and work after poly. (But let's be honest - so many of us still want to move onto uni, public or private) JC kids - you all basically on holiday when expected to make an application.  2) As she mentioned - Open House AFTER our application. When I was NUS' Open Day, I went to the admissions booth to ask about something and there was an Indian father with his son from IB, also asking why is the Open House after their application. Yeah, you could say that we can still find out information on our own, call NUS to ask them about their programs if we are interested etc but aren't we just as much of an applicant and prospective student as the JC kids are... But truth is that they are still looking to recruit JC kids that's why the Open Day is so conveniently dated after their A'Level results are released. (P.S.: IB even earlier, apply in Jan) 3) Considering us based on 4 or 5 sems - NTU considered only my 4-semesters worth of results when making an offer as I could only submit 4-sems at the point of application. I am now appealing to my first choice but as all of us here know, chances are very slim. So my question is - why can't they hold onto their decisions and decide with my full cert? My final sem results literally is my entire year 3 modules because 5th sem roll over to the final sem due to FYP judging. Their explanation is for those with 5 sems, usually not much of a diff by the time 6th sem come, which I agree to some extent, but I believe if the student manage to pull up his grades enough to qualify him for the course he wants, it is doing disservice to his efforts. It is like making a decision based on your prelim results for A'Level kids. I am not complaining about how the odds are against us to begin with. I am just asking for the universities to see all applicants as equal, and given an equally fair shot at being considered. Sorry for the long wall of text - I just want to give you guys some context, which I don't think JC kids would know if not.  ((Tbh, poly kids if you all don't have a preference, there are several engineering is not that hard to go in if you don't mind. GPA 3.4? 3.5? to safely secure a place. 3.4/3.5 should be manageable if you don't slack off too much and put in effort for your assignment/projects, and study for your exams.)) Guys stop arguing here. You just need to work hard whichever path you take that's all.  For myself, I went to Poly, achieved CGPA 3.99/4.00. Doing a SMU Double Degree in Business & Accountancy now and my CGPA is 3.90/4.00 - which is Summa Cum Laude, First Class Honours. And my GPA is obviously higher than quite alot of JC/IB students in SMU, even though I'm from Poly. At the end of the day, stop whining and crying over where you came from. Whether you came from a non-privileged or privileged background, if you did not get a spot in a Local Uni you only have yourself to blame because you did not work hard enough during 'A' levels or Poly.  And Poly students, you know fully well that more spots are allocated to JC students. It's a fact. Move on with it. You know that only the top 10 - 15% of the Poly cohort gets Local Uni admissions. So what if it's not equal, the government has been pushing for an increase in no. of spots allocated to Poly students.  And so what if it's not equal? Being the top 10-15% in poly shows your immense pedigree. Same logic goes to applying for Ivy Leagues with acceptance rates of 1%, you gonna complain to them to ask them to increase their acceptance rate? Or you going to work hard to be part of that 1%? Get over it.  And don't even talk about difference in opportunities because even I wasn't born with a silver spoon myself. Wherever you come from, work hard and succeed.

He just has higher expectations than the general populace when it comes to retaking A levels. Yes,he might not have gotten crappy results,but I can offer an alternative side of the story since I known him during my JC days. During my JC days,I didn't know louie till J2,when my friend invited him over to join us for a game of badminton on a Saturday in our JC. Back then, I only knew louie as being one of the best in maths/chem in my JC and he did well for that in his first A levels,so I was amazed that he was considering of retaking A's  with his results during NS(1yr my senior). He later,told me that he wasn't satisfied with his A levels results,as he hopes to get into pharmacy in NUS.  I lost contact with him,till I finished NS and I was surprised to learn that he took a gap yr after his NS,to volunteer in hospitals and also retake the A levels. I guess at this point of time,girls should be able to empathise with him at the very least,since he went through an extra yr after NS to re-do his A's. In fact,he told me his plans to re-take As this yr,but I advised him not to and to apply for university instead,since it's counter-intuitive to not go into uni,given his financial circumstances.(He can't consider overseas) Though he didn't get to pharmacy(I guess it's pharmacy's loss to not accept him), he got into nanyang scholarship programme,after all the efforts invested. I feel it's a valiant effort,coming from someone who didn't have any tuition,academic guidance during his period of retakes and still managed to make unconventional decisions(that might not seem logical to the majority) that guaranteed his success. Don't judge the book by it's cover,is all I have to say,to anyone who doubts that he doesn't experience emotional pain after each admission cycle. Emotional pain after each admission cycle? This is weird, anyone who did worse than him is suffering worse than him during the admission cycle. He did well to qualify for 95% of the courses in local university, but he is just being bent on getting into Pharmacy.  What Eddie previously meant that Louie was not the most suited person to share his experience about a success story from past failures. An example of a ''real success story'' would be middleofnowhere. He has already been performing extremely well in school, as well in A Levels. But in terms of providing advice to students who are retaking A levels (because they have failed), he will not be able to provide helpful advice. It is not a loss that Pharmacy did not accept him, but he did not fulfil the requirements set by the administration. You mentioned it as a courageous effort of him to retake A levels countless of time despite his financial difficulties, no tuition, etc. But, bear in mind, is he can choose not to retake A levels 4 times and enter Uni straight after NS, but he chose not to. He chose merely because he is obsessed into getting the course he wished to enter. Frankly speaking, from your entire paragraph, what are you trying to conclude? You kept harping on the fact that he retook A levels as if he has no choice, difficult economic situations, people must empathise him, he is really bold in making such decisions, etc.. But, you must not be biased in your opinions just because he is your classmate. I mean, also do clarify what emotional pain that he has to undergo? Being not able to enter Pharmacy, despite having tons of other choices waiting for him to choose from? There are many people out there with so little options to choose from, their emotional pain is far much worse than what he is facing.. Nevertheless, it is great that he finally resigned to his fate and know that he has a slim chance into entering Pharmacy. He should have done that 2 years back, and not clinging on to the hope that he can enter Pharmacy one day. If he had entered any course 2 years back, he can graduate earlier and support his family earlier.",12.763507369730666

By Mr. Davidktw.  23/03/2012. ================================================= Both NTU and NUS Computing is Good if you are a good student. I don't believe in any local university offer particularly better courses. I graduated from NUS SOC and is a Senior Consultant in a local IT firm on web applications and security deployments. I also full time *nix user from Linux to Mac to Hp UX to Solaris. I don't believe NUS Computer Engineering students are any better or worse, but I do agree their courses are designed to gear towards a different sector in computing such as embedding systems and silicon design from Intel, AMD etc and semiconductors fabrication. But nothing is stopping them from taking more SoC 3rd/$th year modules. Same goes for SoC, you can also opt for engineer modules like I took a year 1 module from mechanical engineer and it still benefit me today even though my work doesn't rely on it. I do Arduino programming and also Solidworks design for my friend. So don't be mistaken that anyone tell you that it is better in any local university. That's my opinion. How much you can benefit from the lectures and tutorial is up to your own initiative. If you are passionate about Computing, then you will be interested to learn more even without lecturers and tutors. The courses merely scratches the surface on the relevant discipline, your work is to do your own research and be passionate about what you want to achieve in the near future. Find something you are good in and improve on that aspect. Google is your good friend, relevant forums is your playground, and tertiary university is your incubator. With 3/4 years there, learn what is taught and venture on your own to go in-depth. Get yourself those internship available to get a taste of the industry standard. These are not taught in universities and only through training on the job. If you want to set a good impression in among your future boss, show that you can be independent and doesn't need spoon feeding.

One can only presume a good admissions process to consider all facets of a candidate, not cherry picking only the scores which put said candidate in the best possible light. As a side point, I would like to add that the admission of a permanent resident into the Dentistry course is unheard of -- at least in my circle. For the Medicine course I believe there are but a handful of PRs every cohort (3-5). If this ratio is anything to go by, go figure for Dentistry. One pointer though, please do not parade your Mensa membership as though as it were a feather in your cap worthy of excessive display. Doubtless, entry into this select group is contingent upon your god-given faculties, however it in no way displays your conviction, perservance or aptitude for a dentistry course beyond the fact that you are able to make two and two of a logical problem with greater ease than your non-Mensa brethren.

I'm actually currently an ITE (going to be graduating soon) student that's looking on to which polytechnics I should advance on and then subsequently, I intend on going to Uni to do a degree. While I think the PBL-pedagogy is great I would prefer something old school perhaps like at SP, NYP or maybe even NP. I would be okay with joining any of their generalised Business Diplomas, but because my lecturers here at ITE have been telling me to go to RP supposedly (""for increased chances to get top student and go to Uni"") hence that was where I was going with my original question on RP students who are mainly from R48, R52- what were their odds on advancing to University. Ultimately, I do not want to jeopardise my chances of getting to Uni if I go to RP, because I think even tho there are some benefits about PBL- the Big3 Unis still have some doubts & stigma about the learning style there at RP. At least that's what I heard when I talked to my lecturers.  Idk about you but I feel RP's Business or ""Management"" courses feels really lackluster in terms of what they cover unlike other Polys which offer dual specialisation options. Some of these which one can maybe even use in Uni? I would love to hear your thoughts. Thanks for the reply! I am from that prestigious poly with a motto in Malay ""Berkhidmat dengan Keahlian"". Lots of hype, smoke and mirror ... despite my academic excellence there. Still, I really believe that I am disadvantaged in life without PBL.  With regards to your concern, just concentrate on getting into a poly from ITE and let time dictate the outcome towards university. After all, it really ""is the singer not the song"". Meaning that if you excel in whatever you put your heart and mind to, the place you did it doesn't matter. Nothing can block your progress. You will then be positioned to do what you want to do. Not what you need to do. Like so many poor souls in this forum.  Be in the position where all university invites you to apply for priority (aka early) admission and lay out the 'red carpets' of talks, open house, individualised chats with professors, private group tours of labs, scholarship offers, etc. Be flagged by their admission scouts.

It was supposed to be a celebration, that I received an offer, but it was the absolute last thing I wanted, since it wasn't my first choice, and something that I knew I couldn't accept doing (and was stupid enough to even place it in my choices, ah well).  Subsequently I got rejected by NUS and SMU, because I simply didn't make the cut...

I really wanted to prove to myself that I CAN get into local uni. It didn't help when I'm from one of the top JCs, and my friends are moving on happily to overseas unis with unconditional offers, scholarships, or medicine, law, dentistry... you name it. I was utterly alone. And I felt like I was the only loser in my school (and also a disgrace to my school) who had to retake A levels, who couldn't really make the cut for local uni. In the end, ALL my appeals failed. What's new? Reality slapped me hard in the face, and it hurt like a bitch, of course. What could I do? I had to move on. I then spent some time correcting my mindset before I was actually more mentally stable for my exams. But I just have to tell you that you are really doing yourself a huge disfavour right now. Yes you are disappointed, you are not receiving news, everything seems oh so damn hopeless. But self pity will only kill you, as well as the people around you who love and care for you... do know that YOU are not the only one suffering, your family and friends are too! Everything seems bleak right now yes, but once you get that offer, everything will be merry and bright...  For me, I knew that I wanted to go to uni. I spent that one more year not just preparing for retake, but also redefining my goals and aspirations in my life. Also, building on my character. Depression no more! There were many sacrifices made, many times that I felt like hiding in a cave... but I overcame that and grew so much stronger. As long as you YEARN it, you will get it no matter what, because no one can stop you!! So don't even let the demons in your head stop you, please do not give in to depression. No one can help you except yourself. I suggest you try meditation and yoga, those things saved my ass (': And here I am back this year, legitly exactly one year later. I received my offer from NTU business...... It took one more year, but it was so worth it. Although my story might not be the most impressive one, but I've proved to everyone and most importantly myself that if I want something, I'm gonna make sure I get it, even if it means one year later. Because this is my future, and I am the captain of my ship of fate. I hope that you realise this too, be proud of who you are, of your battlescars, failures and experiences. All these will shape you into who you are — a better you. Chin up!! ",14.79950853226427

Nevertheless, do bear in mind that your service to your school/course is not as valuable as say, someone who chose to volunteer in an area that is related to Medicine. For example, working at the pharmacy, volunteering simple first aid services to the elderly in need/staying alone.  4) Universities does not taking into consideration your past in NS, because JC kids who got in would be training to be medical doctors to serve in NS anyway.  You asked for people to rate your chances, and just because many rated it as very low or even impossible, you call people a wet blanket. If anything, you ought to know that prospective Medicine students have to go through 8 rounds of interview (last heard from a year 3 med student herself) to get in, each testing for different values in you. You are not showing me that you are able to take constructive feedback and given the competitiveness of the places for Medicine, you would most likely have failed the interview, if you even get called up.  I hope you see that your chances are as good as impossible, simply because anyone with a GPA of below 3 would NOT stand a chance for ANY courses in ANY local university. Universities admit based on grades, that's why they have a IGP, and very little on your CCA.

Meatboi96  Just My 2 Cents: I would like to tell you good luck but sometimes its good to take a step back and absorb all the comments in the forums. I don't think that they're trying to be a 'wet blanket' to pull you down but trying to process  some thoughts. From your comments you seemed like a confident person but maybe a little hung onto your past, you may have scored well during O lvls for L1R4 but maybe things happen which caused you to not do well. However consoling yourself that you're the second of your clique doesn't seem to me as a good mindset as you're just limiting yourself. (Staying in your comfort zone.)  Maybe you can try studying for SATs and A lvls for next year or maybe for when you ORD like little by little during the weekends or something.

Agreed on the part for ICT1002 Programming Fundamental, Python is for beginners to learn as var in Python is loosely assign, don't have to care about memory allocation etc. Once student touch C will be another extreme. Memory allocation now is important, assigning var with wrong format and precision will cause C application to crash.

If you are totally new to programming, having ICT1001 supplement these knowledge such as SQL query statement. ICT1001 doesn't teach how to write stored procedure and other more advanced SQL statement such as left join, right join, union etc, while project if you know these trick, it can decrease the burden of writing inefficient codes.

2018,National University of Singapore|nus|computer|com|infosys|information systems|analytics|smart city,interview|Discretionary|aptitude|Scholarship,"Hi,friend. May I know roughly how many places are offered for allied health courses? I was rejected by SIT this week, I am not even on the waitlist. I wonder is it worth for me to appeal if the intake for DR is very low. I cant find any information online.dontgiveup wrote:  Hi ! ~  I just wanna say good job to those who completed the interview for SIT allied health whether or not you have succeeded in being accepted.  For those whom will be attending the upcoming Tea Session, you will actually find out that how lucky u r to get it cos the numbers arent exactly very large (particularly RT cos the intake is only about 18 students).  Those who got shortlisted for interview is already considered very good. Because majority of the students would have gotten rejected from the start. And from the interview itself only about 1-2/8 students will get accepted.  So dont feel too upset about it as well.  To those who plans to try again, GO FOR IT! But do prepare your portfolio in the 1 year apart. Because once u have been shortlisted for interview, results and all no longer matters. It is merely about who u r ... interviewers have 0 knowledge or background on u , it is just how u r reacting. It is normal to fail one or two stations, but more importantly is not letting it affect you.  After all , if u want to be an Allied Health professional u have to strong mentally.  The interview gives u a glimpse of school life. In SIT we go by Trimesters, so this mean to say it is definitely more stressful. U will need to write at least an essay per trimester , so be prepared.  Even for those who got accepted, the tip is just PLAY WHILE U CAN NOW.  Just to share a personal story for those who didnt got in :  2017 was the first year this course started , to be honest i found out the minimum GPA for that year from friends who got in ... it was at least 3.7 just for interview.  I attempted as well (i wanted medicine), but i didnt even got shortlisted.  Yes, it is sad to be rejected ( in fact i applied to NTU, NUS and SIT i got rejected for all of them). But what is more important is , what u plan to do.  Getting sad is inevitable , but it doesnt get u anywhere. Why not let it be ur motivation ? Go for shadowing programmes- see if u r really in for it (we have ppl who realised it isnt their thing after getting in). Volunteer - Gain some experience and show them healthcare is for you.  Lastly, for me ... it was hard but as a poly grad i had issues finding jobs even. Eventually, i lowered myself and worked as a hospital patient assistant for a year. No doubt, it was difficult but at the end of it i do learn something.  I made use of my time in the healthcare setting understanding more on it, being look down is common but it makes u a better healthcare professional when u have experience what it is like to be the one being looked down before u become the one ordering people ard.  Eventually i got in and it was a miracle.  So it is not impossible to get in again but of course success is yours only if u have worked hard for it.  So, dont give up if it is really what u want.  And congratulations to those who got in .... ",12.542541655908256

NUS senior deputy president and provost Ho Teck Hua, who announced the move at a press conference on Monday, said NUS analysis of admission data showed the bonus point can make a difference. ""Let's say one student with 81 points applies for communications as his first choice, and another with 82 points applies to the same course as his second choice. With the 1.25 points, the student who lists the course as his first choice will get ahead of the person with 82 points,"" he said. On why NUS decided on the move, he said: ""If you have done well and are passionate about a career in business or computing, for example, then we want to say to you that we support your passion."" ""We want to help you pursue your passion,"" he said, adding that students passionate about what they study tend to perform better. Professor Ho revealed that, currently, 65 per cent of students given a place in their first-choice course take up the offer, while only 45 per cent of those given their second-choice course do so. Noting NUS graduates' good job prospects, Prof Ho also announced that NUS will be increasing the number of double majors to increase career options for its graduates. ""The nature of work is changing very rapidly, and we need to prepare students for a lifetime of diverse careers,"" he said. He said NUS, which currently offers 94 double major and major-minor combinations, will add another 86 such programmes. ""Someone doing data science and entrepreneurship, for example, can go and work for a range of industries in data science, and also go and do a start-up."" On top of the double majors, NUS also offers 71 double degrees, 33 joint degrees with partner universities and 24 concurrent degrees. Adding all this, currently 15 per cent of NUS students are trained in more than one discipline. Prof Ho said he hopes half of all NUS students will graduate with knowledge and skills in two different fields, so they will have more job offers to choose from. He also announced two new degree programmes for this year, one in pharmaceutical science and the other in veterinary science. Students taking up the 5 1/2-year concurrent veterinary degree programme will graduate with an NUS degree in life sciences and a Doctor of Veterinary Medicine from the University of Melbourne. NUS, which now offers 230 bond-free merit scholarships, will add 200 more scholarships for the new academic year. Ms Geraldine Tan, 19, welcomed the move by NUS and said it is important for young people to get into a field that excites them. She said: ""I really want to study business and maybe go on an overseas college stint as I want to start a social enterprise. Business courses are hard to get into, so I am hoping the bonus points will help me get the edge.""

Therefore, my non-academic profile was considered to be ""insubstantial"" in comparison with other individuals who had the resources to be a full-time student. Whilst there is nothing wrong with awarding scholarships primarily on academic achievement, the current selection criteria and system may be further skewed against lower-income households, as their children may have less in the areas of co-curricular activities, leadership track record, etc, because of their limited financial resources.

""We want to help you pursue your passion,"" he said, adding that students passionate about what they study tend to perform better. Professor Ho revealed that, currently, 65 per cent of students given a place in their first-choice course take up the offer, while only 45 per cent of those given their second-choice course do so. Noting NUS graduates' good job prospects, Prof Ho also announced that NUS will be increasing the number of double majors to increase career options for its graduates. ""The nature of work is changing very rapidly, and we need to prepare students for a lifetime of diverse careers,"" he said. He said NUS, which currently offers 94 double major and major-minor combinations, will add another 86 such programmes. ""Someone doing data science and entrepreneurship, for example, can go and work for a range of industries in data science, and also go and do a start-up."" On top of the double majors, NUS also offers 71 double degrees, 33 joint degrees with partner universities and 24 concurrent degrees. Adding all this, currently 15 per cent of NUS students are trained in more than one discipline. Prof Ho said he hopes half of all NUS students will graduate with knowledge and skills in two different fields, so they will have more job offers to choose from. He also announced two new degree programmes for this year, one in pharmaceutical science and the other in veterinary science. Students taking up the 5 1/2-year concurrent veterinary degree programme will graduate with an NUS degree in life sciences and a Doctor of Veterinary Medicine from the University of Melbourne. NUS, which now offers 230 bond-free merit scholarships, will add 200 more scholarships for the new academic year. Ms Geraldine Tan, 19, welcomed the move by NUS and said it is important for young people to get into a field that excites them. She said: ""I really want to study business and maybe go on an overseas college stint as I want to start a social enterprise. Business courses are hard to get into, so I am hoping the bonus points will help me get the edge."" Hwa Chong Institution student Hannah Ganesh, 18, said increasing double degree options is good as students can diversify their learning and ""challenge themselves"".http://www.straitstimes.com/singapor...choice-courses NUS' new offerings BONUS POINTS FOR FIRST CHOICE Students applying to NUS will be given 1.25 bonus points for their first-choice course. This applies only to courses where entry is based purely on students' grades. MORE DOUBLE MAJORS NUS will be increasing the number of double majors to open up more career options for its graduates. It currently offers 94 double major and major-minor combinations and will add another 86 such programmes. NEW DEGREES A new concurrent degree combines NUS' Bachelor of Science and the Doctor of Veterinary Medicine offered by the University of Melbourne. Students can complete the programmes in 5-1/2 years. NUS is also offering a new joint degree in pharmaceutical science with the University of Dundee in Scotland. The programme is designed to provide students with knowledge and skills for careers in the pharmaceutical, biomedical and consumer healthcare sectors. NUS OVERSEAS COLLEGES The programme that sends students on internships to several entrepreneurial hubs in the world will be extended to Jakarta and Toronto.

Maybe it's just that small handful of students who did the survey and skewed the data?  regarding the point about students in nus being only able to source for internships from career office... That is not true at all. You can always self source (meaning you apply via websites like linkedin for eg by yourself) Oh and student exchange definitely must apply via student office regardless of whether is it nus ntu or smu... Cos all uni already have a list of overseas exchange partner universities that students can apply to then the student office will facilitate the process lor. The process is more or less the same across all 3 uni de.  And one more thing about nus I thought is worth mentioning, they have this NUS Overseas College (NOC) programme where you get to spend 1 year overseas studying and interning... You get to accumulate overseas work exp and clear modules like exchange as well. And the internships are paid. And there are many countries u can go to via this programme - Europe, Asia, USA. Do look it up. I kinda regretted not going 😭 cos it's such a valuable opportunity esp if u are passionate about entrepreneurship.Even if u are not its fine it's still great overseas exposure and it value adds to your resume! Oh and every school is competitive, not just SMU because regardless of which course or uni you go to, the bell curve is everywhere.  Choose your school based on the curriculum, the non academic opportunities available and the culture. Talk to seniors Or students who are studying in the universities and courses you have in mind to find out more. Talk to the recent students who have just graduated to find out more about the actual employment prospects and salary trends across the various unis and courses.  Hope this helps more people to come to a decision on which school to choose.",14.269173040234026

However, I have to pop your bubble. Computing is not a good course. Computing has always been shunned by students in the past. 1 of the main reason is because computing is on the cutting edge of technology and it becomes obsolete very quickly. You may have seen the recent graduate salary survey that ranks computing as 1 of the highest starting pay for fresh grads. This is a little odd, as there are no shortage of computing grads in Singapore. The intake for computing students has always been huge in Singapore. If so, why is there a demand for these fresh grads? This is because many of those earlier graduates have become obsolete and there is a constant demand for fresh blood. This also means that you will become obsolete very quickly after you have graduated. It also means that the career ceiling tends to be very low. I think that the recent push by the govt to promote computing will end up like their failure in pushing biomedical sciences. #hard truths. Up for this and adding on to what Flatron mentioned. CS course has existed way far back and it was infamous for being a dumping ground for prospective undergrad students  Not to mention the typical stereotype/stigma that comes with it, eg. People think you fix computer when you say you study CS.  Worst if they ask you to help fix their computer when there is a problem (not troubleshooting btw, is hardware problem). People in the IT department always got called by other department to help fix other not so IT related stuffs like aircon not working, printer not working & etc  This is what IT is like before all this hype LOL. nyarlathotepia wrote:  That's true. Anyone planning to enter CS should be keen on life-long learning. I notice that some of my peers just hope to graduate with a Bachelor's, get a good job, and go onto autopilot. People like this don't suit computing because even the undergrad modules are already outdated. It really takes passion to keep up with new developments and talent/hard work to make sure one is up to par with industry standards, plus personal projects and so on. It takes way more than that tbh if you want to continue stay in this industry ... normally people who graduated, after a few years of working they will get married and start a family. Where to find the time to constantly catch up on the industry standards (unless you intend to stay single for your whole life to focus on your career), that's when the company starts looking for 'Fresh Blood' kicks in. Normally people in CS will end up in a managerial role later in their life, as the career path for CS students are really limited and remain stagnant after sometime. So it boils down to whether or not is it worth the trouble to go for this course when you are gonna end up competing for a management role with other people who has a degree in management. But of course, a manager with a CS background will be well-loved by the IT people. Why? Because the manager is then well aware of how ridiculous some of the request coming out from some other people from other department are and therefore they can step in to help better adjust the project delivery schedule.  And that, I think is why people kept saying to go for this course only if you really have the passion in learning what this course offers ",11.967178165080426

Approximately half of the graduates don't get full-time jobs. I scrutinized the data and it was stated that full-time employment means more than 35 hours per week, and a non-temporary job. This means that half of those who graduate from NUS with a Bachelor in Sciences don't have permanent jobs, or don't work more than 35 hours a week, or are working part time. I have also taken into account of the fact that there are differences in cohort sizes and that may affect the percentages as well. For instance, Maritime Studies has a very small cohort in comparison to NUS Science, and seem to fit the demands of shipping companies better, and are hence mostly employed full-time upon graduation. Furthermore, they seem to receive a lot of govt support/funding for them to go on internships. Moreover, for the more general degrees such as NUS Science, the lack of full-time employment could be skewed towards one major in particular (since NUS Science can mean Life Sciences, Mathematics, Physics, etc.) But damn, doesn't change how dismal the prospects seem for some of these courses. Can someone comment and advise me on whether to take this data into consideration when applying to uni? I am interested in Biology and Economics in general but am rather hesitant about my choices after having seen the data. 10 dollars just apply If u have interest in a subject = Easier to study = Score 1st class = Get relevant internships easily as u have high GPA = Translate into good jobs into your desired field = End",10.852459473914472

That is not true at all. You can always self source (meaning you apply via websites like linkedin for eg by yourself) Oh and student exchange definitely must apply via student office regardless of whether is it nus ntu or smu... Cos all uni already have a list of overseas exchange partner universities that students can apply to then the student office will facilitate the process lor. The process is more or less the same across all 3 uni de.  And one more thing about nus I thought is worth mentioning, they have this NUS Overseas College (NOC) programme where you get to spend 1 year overseas studying and interning... You get to accumulate overseas work exp and clear modules like exchange as well. And the internships are paid. And there are many countries u can go to via this programme - Europe, Asia, USA. Do look it up. I kinda regretted not going 😭 cos it's such a valuable opportunity esp if u are passionate about entrepreneurship.Even if u are not its fine it's still great overseas exposure and it value adds to your resume! Oh and every school is competitive, not just SMU because regardless of which course or uni you go to, the bell curve is everywhere.  Choose your school based on the curriculum, the non academic opportunities available and the culture. Talk to seniors Or students who are studying in the universities and courses you have in mind to find out more. Talk to the recent students who have just graduated to find out more about the actual employment prospects and salary trends across the various unis and courses.  Hope this helps more people to come to a decision on which school to choose.",14.128995358160314

You asked for people to rate your chances, and just because many rated it as very low or even impossible, you call people a wet blanket.

I don't think that they're trying to be a 'wet blanket' to pull you down but trying to process  some thoughts. From your comments you seemed like a confident person but maybe a little hung onto your past, you may have scored well during O lvls for L1R4 but maybe things happen which caused you to not do well. However consoling yourself that you're the second of your clique doesn't seem to me as a good mindset as you're just limiting yourself. (Staying in your comfort zone.)  Maybe you can try studying for SATs and A lvls for next year or maybe for when you ORD like little by little during the weekends or something. It could be helpful  And you don't have to challenge me about my grades i scored 2.1 G.P.A during poly hahaha Honestly wish you the best for your application ",13.879096949583689

However, I have to pop your bubble. Computing is not a good course. Computing has always been shunned by students in the past. 1 of the main reason is because computing is on the cutting edge of technology and it becomes obsolete very quickly. You may have seen the recent graduate salary survey that ranks computing as 1 of the highest starting pay for fresh grads. This is a little odd, as there are no shortage of computing grads in Singapore. The intake for computing students has always been huge in Singapore. If so, why is there a demand for these fresh grads? This is because many of those earlier graduates have become obsolete and there is a constant demand for fresh blood. This also means that you will become obsolete very quickly after you have graduated. It also means that the career ceiling tends to be very low. I think that the recent push by the govt to promote computing will end up like their failure in pushing biomedical sciences. #hard truths. Up for this and adding on to what Flatron mentioned. CS course has existed way far back and it was infamous for being a dumping ground for prospective undergrad students  Not to mention the typical stereotype/stigma that comes with it, eg. People think you fix computer when you say you study CS.  Worst if they ask you to help fix their computer when there is a problem (not troubleshooting btw, is hardware problem). People in the IT department always got called by other department to help fix other not so IT related stuffs like aircon not working, printer not working & etc  This is what IT is like before all this hype LOL. nyarlathotepia wrote:  That's true. Anyone planning to enter CS should be keen on life-long learning. I notice that some of my peers just hope to graduate with a Bachelor's, get a good job, and go onto autopilot. People like this don't suit computing because even the undergrad modules are already outdated. It really takes passion to keep up with new developments and talent/hard work to make sure one is up to par with industry standards, plus personal projects and so on. It takes way more than that tbh if you want to continue stay in this industry ... normally people who graduated, after a few years of working they will get married and start a family. Where to find the time to constantly catch up on the industry standards (unless you intend to stay single for your whole life to focus on your career), that's when the company starts looking for 'Fresh Blood' kicks in. Normally people in CS will end up in a managerial role later in their life, as the career path for CS students are really limited and remain stagnant after sometime. So it boils down to whether or not is it worth the trouble to go for this course when you are gonna end up competing for a management role with other people who has a degree in management. But of course, a manager with a CS background will be well-loved by the IT people. Why? Because the manager is then well aware of how ridiculous some of the request coming out from some other people from other department are and therefore they can step in to help better adjust the project delivery schedule.  And that, I think is why people kept saying to go for this course only if you really have the passion in learning what this course offers ",12.062387488571193

May I know why you always wanted PPGA over Pol science? PPGA, as its name suggests, is more geared towards public policy and public administration. Having said that, there is also a “global affairs” component where you can also choose to “specialise” in international relations modules. But if you are a more political philosophy person, it is recommended that you choose Philosophy or go to NUS Pol Science because PPGA offers limited modules in that area. I have peers who are on the PA/PP track where generally do not take IR modules (other than compulsory ones). Vice versa, there are those who are the GA track and generally avoid PA/PP modules lol. Of course, you can also have a combination, depending on your interest. As for career and employment, majority of my seniors in PPGA joined the public service, mostly in ministries and statutory boards including MFA, MOF, MOM, MTI, MOE. Name it and you have it lol. Also there are a handful that went to the media industry joining CNA/SPH as journalists.  Ultimately, your grades and attitude will determine how far you go in life.

Haha  Some things I would like to clarify for the benefit of everyone, which is based on my own knowledge and experience talking to friends across all 3 universities.  First and foremost, please take the employment surveys as a pinch of salt. Your salary won't be guaranteed to be higher just because you are enrolled in a particular university that is reported to have higher gross starting pay. Trust me,  when I was deciding on uni like you guys many years ago, I was affected by the graduate employment survey as well but then after years in uni and finally working,  I realised the survey might be misleading... Just so you know, most of these times when the graduates answer these surveys, the schools don't even check whether the pay you entered is true or not...How much you will get for your starting pay depends on your EXPERIENCE, your GRADES, your NEGOTIATION SKILLS, the ECONOMIC OUTLOOK at that POINT IN TIME,  the INDUSTRY and JOB SCOPE. Which uni honestly doesn't matter, cos all 3 local unis are considered on par to one another in the employers' eyes.  and it's just gross pay. There are other components in a salary package like bonuses and benefits which are not captured in the employment surveys. Some people may have a lower gross pay but may have higher bonuses and benefits (eg more days of leave) than someone with higher gross pay who may have less attractive bonuses and benefits. And many times, these surveys are not even representative of the whole student population as not all 100% of the graduating cohort would have completed the survey. Maybe it's just that small handful of students who did the survey and skewed the data?  regarding the point about students in nus being only able to source for internships from career office... That is not true at all. You can always self source (meaning you apply via websites like linkedin for eg by yourself) Oh and student exchange definitely must apply via student office regardless of whether is it nus ntu or smu... Cos all uni already have a list of overseas exchange partner universities that students can apply to then the student office will facilitate the process lor. The process is more or less the same across all 3 uni de.  And one more thing about nus I thought is worth mentioning, they have this NUS Overseas College (NOC) programme where you get to spend 1 year overseas studying and interning... You get to accumulate overseas work exp and clear modules like exchange as well. And the internships are paid. And there are many countries u can go to via this programme - Europe, Asia, USA. Do look it up. I kinda regretted not going 😭 cos it's such a valuable opportunity esp if u are passionate about entrepreneurship.Even if u are not its fine it's still great overseas exposure and it value adds to your resume! Oh and every school is competitive, not just SMU because regardless of which course or uni you go to, the bell curve is everywhere.  Choose your school based on the curriculum, the non academic opportunities available and the culture. Talk to seniors Or students who are studying in the universities and courses you have in mind to find out more. Talk to the recent students who have just graduated to find out more about the actual employment prospects and salary trends across the various unis and courses.  Hope this helps more people to come to a decision on which school to choose.",14.165232303588766

For example, working at the pharmacy, volunteering simple first aid services to the elderly in need/staying alone.  4) Universities does not taking into consideration your past in NS, because JC kids who got in would be training to be medical doctors to serve in NS anyway.  You asked for people to rate your chances, and just because many rated it as very low or even impossible, you call people a wet blanket.

You are not showing me that you are able to take constructive feedback and given the competitiveness of the places for Medicine, you would most likely have failed the interview, if you even get called up.  I hope you see that your chances are as good as impossible, simply because anyone with a GPA of below 3 would NOT stand a chance for ANY courses in ANY local university.

I don't think that they're trying to be a 'wet blanket' to pull you down but trying to process  some thoughts. From your comments you seemed like a confident person but maybe a little hung onto your past, you may have scored well during O lvls for L1R4 but maybe things happen which caused you to not do well. However consoling yourself that you're the second of your clique doesn't seem to me as a good mindset as you're just limiting yourself. (Staying in your comfort zone.)  Maybe you can try studying for SATs and A lvls for next year or maybe for when you ORD like little by little during the weekends or something. It could be helpful  And you don't have to challenge me about my grades i scored 2.1 G.P.A during poly hahaha Honestly wish you the best for your application ",13.833327964113684

2018,National University of Singapore|nus|computer|com|infosys|information systems|analytics|smart city,Curriculum|Curriculumn|courses|modules|pedagogy,"Hi,friend. May I know roughly how many places are offered for allied health courses? I was rejected by SIT this week, I am not even on the waitlist. I wonder is it worth for me to appeal if the intake for DR is very low. I cant find any information online.dontgiveup wrote:  Hi ! ~  I just wanna say good job to those who completed the interview for SIT allied health whether or not you have succeeded in being accepted.  For those whom will be attending the upcoming Tea Session, you will actually find out that how lucky u r to get it cos the numbers arent exactly very large (particularly RT cos the intake is only about 18 students).  Those who got shortlisted for interview is already considered very good. Because majority of the students would have gotten rejected from the start. And from the interview itself only about 1-2/8 students will get accepted.  So dont feel too upset about it as well.  To those who plans to try again, GO FOR IT! But do prepare your portfolio in the 1 year apart. Because once u have been shortlisted for interview, results and all no longer matters. It is merely about who u r ... interviewers have 0 knowledge or background on u , it is just how u r reacting. It is normal to fail one or two stations, but more importantly is not letting it affect you.  After all , if u want to be an Allied Health professional u have to strong mentally.  The interview gives u a glimpse of school life. In SIT we go by Trimesters, so this mean to say it is definitely more stressful. U will need to write at least an essay per trimester , so be prepared.  Even for those who got accepted, the tip is just PLAY WHILE U CAN NOW.  Just to share a personal story for those who didnt got in :  2017 was the first year this course started , to be honest i found out the minimum GPA for that year from friends who got in ... it was at least 3.7 just for interview.  I attempted as well (i wanted medicine), but i didnt even got shortlisted.  Yes, it is sad to be rejected ( in fact i applied to NTU, NUS and SIT i got rejected for all of them). But what is more important is , what u plan to do.  Getting sad is inevitable , but it doesnt get u anywhere. Why not let it be ur motivation ? Go for shadowing programmes- see if u r really in for it (we have ppl who realised it isnt their thing after getting in). Volunteer - Gain some experience and show them healthcare is for you.  Lastly, for me ... it was hard but as a poly grad i had issues finding jobs even. Eventually, i lowered myself and worked as a hospital patient assistant for a year. No doubt, it was difficult but at the end of it i do learn something.  I made use of my time in the healthcare setting understanding more on it, being look down is common but it makes u a better healthcare professional when u have experience what it is like to be the one being looked down before u become the one ordering people ard.  Eventually i got in and it was a miracle.  So it is not impossible to get in again but of course success is yours only if u have worked hard for it.  So, dont give up if it is really what u want.  And congratulations to those who got in .... ",12.255923091868562

Totally agree with you that scholarship should not be awarded based on academic performance only, which I did mention in my earlier post. The primary objective of my earlier post aims to encourage individuals who are currently applying/appealing for admission and/or scholarship - through the sharing of my education journey and the challenges experienced as an individual with a disadvantaged background. Subsequently, the post also seeks to highlight the flaws in the basis of selection for the scholarship interview. Today, institutions are still using a uniform assessment method to evaluate people of diverse backgrounds. The assessment for academic potential is pretty straightforward - cGPA, awards, and other academic achievement obtained from other sources (e.g. competitions, courses, etc.). The tricky part lies in the assessment of non-academic components - institutions seek individuals with certain attributes, qualities, and skills (e.g. leadership, teamwork, entrepreneurship, integrity, sports achievement, etc.). And often, institutions only consider school-related activities and/or co-curricular activities as the samples for their assessment.  On a personal note, I believed that those attributes, qualities, and skillscould also beidentified and assessed through employment experience (e.g. customers' testimonials, appraisals by superiors, awards attained, etc.).  In general, institutions should also look beyond the school-related activities and co-curricular activities when assessing the non-academic components of individuals. Hence, granting more flexibility for underprivileged students whose non-academic profile were considered as ""insubstantial"" and thereby allowing  them to have the opportunity to share their stories. Ultimately, an interview is all we need.P.s. I'm glad that your hard work paid off, and congrats on securing that scholarship offered by a private company  (I missed the application deadline for private & government scholarship ) To be shortlisted for interview on the government scholarship with 3.5GPA, you must have some really outstanding non-academic achievements! Do you mind to share with us? And hello senior , assuming you are an SMU student (based on the GPA capped at 4.0). As an individual with similar experience, juggling between full-time work and study is really no joke, not to mention that you are doing it at the University-level and still managed to scored a decent grade. Mind to share what full-time job you work as? Do you study in the day, and work at night/after-school hours? Did you, perhaps, packed all modules into that few days so that you could work for the rest of the days in the week? Sincerely hope that you can share some tips with us/me Networking/cloud computing consultant. And if you can get some really well-known individual in the industry to write recommendation letter would really be helpful.

Was a Singapore polytechnic DEEE graduate from 2014 graduation and took decision to go to NUS EE entered in 2016/2017 S1 where the modules introduced were quite daunting tbh. The environment was not great with lots of competition for project modules and even for tests and exams where test scores when revealed shows the average or median mark and see where you stand within the cohort taking the module. So as many know it’s under this bell curve system so depending on cohort performance you can get higher or lower grades. This part irks me as when crunch periods you wouldn’t wanna help too much and result others to potentially overtake you for those grades.  Terms of lifestyle in EE it’s a myth there’s any sort of life beyond mugging as most modules require constant revision to grasp concepts and to apply them for the various types of assessments. Ppl who say enter Uni got cca and other commitments typically either those priority not so much on grades but for well rounded perspective. Feel there’s growing trend of exploitation of exchange programmes or summer school programmes to map modules overseas and causing schemes to map the harder modules overseas to count as pass/fail instead of being graded. This can create quite an unfair perspective that only with money make the life easier just like that. But modules taken they range many applications of maths and physics with some modules emphasis of programming causing most problems. Expect a tight schedule to juggle the assignments and projects depending on modules as before you know it left exams to grind for and it’s been constantly there for now the 4th semester out of 6 semesters I have experienced so far. More details on modules I did can look at NUS EE recommended schedule for 2016/2017 direct entry poly students 3 years programme. Only difference for me I took diploma plus programme for Maths so I was exempted from MA1301, a bridging maths module and did smth else instead which was ES1103 for those scoring band 2 for QET. Feel free ask more about those within NUS EE, for NTU EE can check someone else. Ps: For myself poly entrant, wasn’t entitled to compulsory 6 months internship within the Uni education so I had to secure a 3 months version myself to get this experience as wasn’t part of curriculum.",11.98209170415943

However, I have to pop your bubble. Computing is not a good course. Computing has always been shunned by students in the past. 1 of the main reason is because computing is on the cutting edge of technology and it becomes obsolete very quickly. You may have seen the recent graduate salary survey that ranks computing as 1 of the highest starting pay for fresh grads. This is a little odd, as there are no shortage of computing grads in Singapore. The intake for computing students has always been huge in Singapore. If so, why is there a demand for these fresh grads? This is because many of those earlier graduates have become obsolete and there is a constant demand for fresh blood. This also means that you will become obsolete very quickly after you have graduated. It also means that the career ceiling tends to be very low. I think that the recent push by the govt to promote computing will end up like their failure in pushing biomedical sciences. #hard truths. Up for this and adding on to what Flatron mentioned. CS course has existed way far back and it was infamous for being a dumping ground for prospective undergrad students  Not to mention the typical stereotype/stigma that comes with it, eg. People think you fix computer when you say you study CS.  Worst if they ask you to help fix their computer when there is a problem (not troubleshooting btw, is hardware problem). People in the IT department always got called by other department to help fix other not so IT related stuffs like aircon not working, printer not working & etc  This is what IT is like before all this hype LOL. nyarlathotepia wrote:  That's true. Anyone planning to enter CS should be keen on life-long learning. I notice that some of my peers just hope to graduate with a Bachelor's, get a good job, and go onto autopilot. People like this don't suit computing because even the undergrad modules are already outdated. It really takes passion to keep up with new developments and talent/hard work to make sure one is up to par with industry standards, plus personal projects and so on. It takes way more than that tbh if you want to continue stay in this industry ... normally people who graduated, after a few years of working they will get married and start a family. Where to find the time to constantly catch up on the industry standards (unless you intend to stay single for your whole life to focus on your career), that's when the company starts looking for 'Fresh Blood' kicks in. Normally people in CS will end up in a managerial role later in their life, as the career path for CS students are really limited and remain stagnant after sometime. So it boils down to whether or not is it worth the trouble to go for this course when you are gonna end up competing for a management role with other people who has a degree in management. But of course, a manager with a CS background will be well-loved by the IT people. Why? Because the manager is then well aware of how ridiculous some of the request coming out from some other people from other department are and therefore they can step in to help better adjust the project delivery schedule.  And that, I think is why people kept saying to go for this course only if you really have the passion in learning what this course offers ",11.97265560962941

I'm pretty sure there's only anecdotal evidence available, but that's better than nothing.  I'm a science student that'd love to major in computer science. As of the fifth semester, I have a cGPA of 3.942 and my L1R4 is 6. While I don't have Amath, I do take advanced math modules, which I have been told will more than waive the requirement. Considering that I didn’t get accepted during the early admission exercise and the sustained radio silence from both universities, I’m starting to wonder if I’ll be shuffled back into science after all. Sigh! As a poly grad now in NTU, I only got one answer for all of you poly grads: If your GPA is far from their cut-off, do not pin any hopes on the universities. But if your GPA is nicely within their 10th percentile, then yes you definitely stand a good chance but then again, anything can happen. 3.94 seems okay, you just gotta wait and I hope you wrote well for your personal statement. They don't care what you studied in poly, its the GPA that they look at, and look at only.  So if you have GPA 3.3 and aiming for WKW, I would dare say your chances are very very very slim, even with your Dip w Merit, because there are people from other comms courses who may have a way higher GPA (that may meet the 10th percentile), yet did not get Dip w Merit. If you are trying by DA, which I highly recommend to anyone from poly, you really need to show that you have done comms-related stuff before, best if you have won some awards. CCA records are really nothing in their eyes, because every other JC kid also have good CCA records because it is simply part of their school life. To qualify under DA, you need to have something more than everyone else don't. Even then, there is no guarantee they will call you up for interview. I had a friend from NP comms who tried for two years, each year with additional things to her portfolio as she is working now, and did not get it.",11.85034568070398

I received offers for business from NTU, NUS and SMU, but I am deciding between NUS and SMU business. I studied Business in Poly and I am interested to pursue double major in Uni. I am interested in entrepreneurship and want to work at a startup or run my own startup in the future.  Reasons why I want to study at NUS: Pros: - More comfortable with NUS's teaching style of lecture and tutorials which is similar to Poly teaching style  - hall life as I want to experience campus living  - can get 5 modules exemptions and graduate within 3.5 years  - chance to participate in NUS Overseas College Programme  Cons: - Heard it is quite competitive and hard to get into honours programme  - perception that NUS Students do not speak as well compared to SMU Students  - non-compulsory internship so need ownself self source  Reasons why I want to study at SMU: pros:  - stronger employment prospects with higher starting salary and employment rate  - compulsory internship - 100% global exposure to Student exchange programmes, etc - can get 5 modules exemptions and graduate within 3-3.5 years  - gain stronger soft skills  Cons: - may not be comfortable with SMU's seminar style of teaching as I don't participate much in tutorials so may affect class participation Btw nus business students also have compulsory overseas exposure which started from 2017, compared with smu which is starting the compulsory overseas exposure from this year. nus is now also offering a direct honour programmes from 2017 with direct admission to major and minor programmes. Nus has a lot of seminar teaching styles now. It is only for content heavy subjects that they use lecture to teach. So you still need to speak up.http://bba.nus.edu/docs/2018-BBA-Brochure.pdf refere to the nus brochure edit: referring to the GES from the one in reddit, NUS honour students has an employment rate of 93.66% and a mean salary of $4388 while smu cum laude students has an employment rate of 92% and a mean salary of $4504. so if you look at this nus has a higher employment rate albeit lower salary.

For SMU SIS Interaction day, if your email state that no preparation is needed then it would probably be the same experience as mine.  First we enter into a holding area where they let us connect to the visitor wifi. Then we were brought to a seminar room and the lecturer introduce themselves and more about the school via an online quiz (KAHOOT). Its not a competitive quiz but more of a sharing session about the future or IT and the program/tracks offer by SMU SIS.  Afterwards, a year 2 SMU student come in and share her experience in SMU and theres a mini Q&A session with her.  Lastly, we were given a comic strip with regards to future innovation. 5 min to read the quiz, then in groups of 4, we were supposed to list the innovations, issues and solution. The lecturer will walk around while we discuss in groups to ensure we're on the right track. After about 15 min, we were to present it to them. However, not every group were given equal opportunity to present. The floor is open for any group to present. Only 3-5 person manage to share their thoughts before they wrap up.

I grew fondly for social science (i.e. psychology) even though I am a poly student who studies accountancy and have a mixture of accounting and business knowledge. 2. I feel that I want to study with a deeper meaning and that it would benefit both society and myself. (I love to make people smile and be happy, thinking on the positive side) 3. I would not only just basically want to study on psychology, I want to expand my knowledge such as taking extra courses that would broaden my career prospects. The above facts are there to briefly describe what are my thoughts now because I do not want to regret choosing the wrong course in the end but still I'm planning to enter a local uni as of now. I would really appreciate any feedbacks or suggestions from any point of view.  Thanks guys!    Hi, im currently a y1 psych student in NTU! I believe NTU/NUS would be a better choice given your goals and aims in life! In ntu, besides taking the psych core mods, many NTU psych majors also take up NIE mods as their minors (such as in counselling, special needs, early childhood, youth pathopsychology, educational psychology and the list goes on HAHA) In nus, i believe there are social work modules that you can take either as a second major, minor or free electives (which seems to suit your passion of helping others!) I feel that SMU is more geared towards business and may not necessarily suits your future career aspirations (not because it's not as good but it doesn't seem in line with your goals) Also, maybe you can take into consideration the environment you work best in and maybe travelling time (because tbh, there shouldn't be that much diff between the 3 uni in terms of prestige- psychology in the 3 uni aren't ranked very highly in the world actually- most of my coursemates would love to enrol in overseas uni if they got the $$$)  also, I am not in the position to speak for poly students since Im from the JC route (so im not very sure ^^""; all I know is that NUS FASS cop is BBC/B and NTU psych cop is AAC/C to apply; I didnt apply to SMU psych- however, i heard it's based more on interviews rather than just your rp like for NTU/NUS? Im not very sure) Actually, you may also consider that NTU psych is a direct honours track, and direct honours is basically what it is; however, if you are not planning to take masters (in which having honours makes it easier to), you should save your money and just go NUS FASS (3 years if you cant/dont want to get honours) Hope this helps!

Please share your views on it as well. I really hope to get into NUS IS (I am interested in the modules offered) but no news till now so I am already prepared to face the worst scenario. I did receive an offer from SMU so I still got Plan B.  However, SMU school fees is higher than NUS by over 10k, which really makes me think whether should I take up SMU offer.  Personally, I like both SMU and NUS but school fees is really a factor that I must take into account of. Moreover, I do not have an extensive knowledge on how SMU IS curriculum. I wonder is it the same as NUS? or does it differ a lot?  So if NUS rejects me this year, I intend to reject SMU offer, and apply next year to NUS. The reason being university will no longer take into account of O Level result from Y2020 onwards. I was a PFP student and does not have an O Level result thus the long wait or possible rejection from NUS. So I would like to ask what are some of your thoughts on this?  1) Should I reject SMU this year and apply for NUS next year?  2) Do I stand a higher chance in getting accepted if I apply next year?

Overall I am wondering which school is better to attend? What are the pros and cons for both schools? I'm not sure about NTU, but I can share some from my perspective as an SMU Accountancy student.Similarities1. Content: NTU and SMU accounting modules are similar according to my NTU Accountancy friends.  More or less the same, but the depth may vary according to the electives taken. 2. Seminar style: SMU has it for all classes. NTU has it, but I'm not sure.3. Exemptions: - For professional qualifications, for SMU, you can get 12 out of 15 exemptions (provided you pass the requisite papers) for ICAEW. - For NTU, I'm not sure, but I've a friend who took advanced tax and (i heard) is exempted from CA Singapore's Tax paper. (Need to confirm.)Differences1. Cost SMU = $11k per annum for 4 years = $44k NTU = $8k per annum for 3 years = $24k Yup the cost difference is quite large (assuming we don't factor in hostel fees).2. Exemptions - This is more applicable if you're a poly student. If your poly's CGPA is >= 3.8, you can get a maximum of 10+ exemptions from SMU. This means you can graduate in 3 years from SMU even without overloading modules. 3. Location - SMU is more accessible, unless you stay in the west then NTU is more accessible.4. Ability to SU modules! - SMU: Has the option to SU two elective modules only when you file for graduation.  - NTU: Can SU some electives according to their website. 5. Graduate starting pay Already mentioned by SiaoLengKeng earlier in this thread, the starting pay for big 4 for both NTU and SMU graduates are similar. $3,000+ for audit.6. Other misc requirements - SMU has a compulsory 80 hours community service requirement + 1x overseas trip requirement. Overall, if we compare just by cost alone, NTU would be better because it is more cost efficient, but if we consider other factors, then there's no uni that's ""better"". It'll depend on your personal preference!",9.832542789051201

I believe NTU/NUS would be a better choice given your goals and aims in life! In ntu, besides taking the psych core mods, many NTU psych majors also take up NIE mods as their minors (such as in counselling, special needs, early childhood, youth pathopsychology, educational psychology and the list goes on HAHA) In nus, i believe there are social work modules that you can take either as a second major, minor or free electives (which seems to suit your passion of helping others!) I feel that SMU is more geared towards business and may not necessarily suits your future career aspirations (not because it's not as good but it doesn't seem in line with your goals) Also, maybe you can take into consideration the environment you work best in and maybe travelling time (because tbh, there shouldn't be that much diff between the 3 uni in terms of prestige- psychology in the 3 uni aren't ranked very highly in the world actually- most of my coursemates would love to enrol in overseas uni if they got the $$$)  also, I am not in the position to speak for poly students since Im from the JC route (so im not very sure ^^""; all I know is that NUS FASS cop is BBC/B and NTU psych cop is AAC/C to apply; I didnt apply to SMU psych- however, i heard it's based more on interviews rather than just your rp like for NTU/NUS? Im not very sure) Actually, you may also consider that NTU psych is a direct honours track, and direct honours is basically what it is; however, if you are not planning to take masters (in which having honours makes it easier to), you should save your money and just go NUS FASS (3 years if you cant/dont want to get honours) Hope this helps!

It is almost impossible to do a non-traditional second major because you only have 3 years to graduate and very few units for electives. 3) Contrary to popular belief, nbs is not well-known outside Singapore at all , although the ntu brand does have some mileage in asia. 4) CCA is a moot point becauase all unis have CCAs. However, it is true that hall life may be an important consideration for some applicants. And lastly, SMU has way better career services because: - They are located in the city, it is easy to get companies to come down or to get students to attend talks - Because they are located in the city, it is also easy for their students to do part-time internships - They have a much stronger alumni network - Their career service office is much more pro-active than nbs The nbs career office always jokes about how smu students are only good at talking/presentation.

I think the whole “3 vs 4 years” debate comes up every intake, and it’s easy to think linearly and say that NBS > SMU Biz/Acc. However, would like to point out that: 1) Depending on the number of exemptions, one may be able to complete the program in 3 or 3.5 years, rather than four. 2) SMU’s curriculum is more holistic in that you don’t just take courses specific to your domain, but are able to take a second major to learn a complementary discipline (ie Accounting w/ second major in Finance or Finance w/ a second major in Economics, and there are so many other combinations as well). The core modules also address topics that are quite pertinent to self-improvement, which I think is beneficial.  3) SMU is a management school, and so you get a number of inherent advantages from studying Biz/Acc here. The emphasis on corporate skills, the professors, the school culture, and the proximity to the CBD all contribute to making students more effective management professionals.  4) SMU may not be known for the hostel experience, but the vibrancy of the CCAs more than makes up for it.  Ultimately, I believe the choice has to made by oneself. But I do think the preceding points could definitely aid in one’s research to see what best fits him or her.

You can graduate faster in 3 years and start working earlier, but 4 years lets you do more internships and take more modules. Up to individual preference. 2) The nbs second major is severely limited. It is almost impossible to do a non-traditional second major because you only have 3 years to graduate and very few units for electives. 3) Contrary to popular belief, nbs is not well-known outside Singapore at all , although the ntu brand does have some mileage in asia. 4) CCA is a moot point becauase all unis have CCAs. However, it is true that hall life may be an important consideration for some applicants. And lastly, SMU has way better career services because: - They are located in the city, it is easy to get companies to come down or to get students to attend talks - Because they are located in the city, it is also easy for their students to do part-time internships - They have a much stronger alumni network - Their career service office is much more pro-active than nbs The nbs career office always jokes about how smu students are only good at talking/presentation. But just look at linkedin for the career outcomes of NBS students compared to SMU students. The NBS guy will probably end up in Big4 while the SMU guy is in a bank.

You would have to put in effort from week 1 if you want to maintain your gpa. In my first sem, majority of my classmates are from mid tier to top jcs (anderson, hwachong, raffles, acjc and etc).

The culture is very cheena, so if you are not cheena, I strongly suggest NUS or SMU if not you will be like a fish out of water. In terms of career services, SMU is ahead. They usually get better placements, and students can do internships during the term due to the proximity of the school to CBD. They are way ahead of NUS and NTU in placing their students into good jobs. But school fees more expensive, and SMU doesn't have hall life (if you want to experience it). Also seems that the competition there is extremely fierce (class participation anyone?). But its in the city which also has some perks. Probably NTU if you just wanna grad quickly and be an auditor (although many also end up in management associate roles). SMU may be better if you are aiming for front office finance positions. actually for poly grads going uni & intend to go big4, better to go SIT. can become Associate 2 upon graduation and it is 2-3 years course. but if want big 3 then NTU because 3 years course.

For NTU, unlike SMU SOSS or NUS FASS, we don't go through those introductory courses and you don't pick your specialization after  year 1. You directly get into your course in NTU and get modules specifically (i.e. psychology) based.  This is a one of the advantage of being in NTU whereas, i heard sometimes if you want a specific course (i.e. psych) , you have to ""fight"" for it. The more popular the course, the harder to get in. Oh, btw most poly graduates are exempted from several GERPEs. (Modules that you are required to take ranging from sciences, business, liberal arts, etc.)  2. You can look into sociology too? This degree is about the society and people. (You can DM me about sociology cause I'm in this course  )  3. You can always take a minor in ntu.",10.172660499885119

Also anecdotal evidence from my own mum- she takes accountancy but that's not her passion (not just that, she kinda sucks at it- she's more of a arts and social sciences person).

The core modules also address topics that are quite pertinent to self-improvement, which I think is beneficial.  3) SMU is a management school, and so you get a number of inherent advantages from studying Biz/Acc here. The emphasis on corporate skills, the professors, the school culture, and the proximity to the CBD all contribute to making students more effective management professionals.  4) SMU may not be known for the hostel experience, but the vibrancy of the CCAs more than makes up for it.  Ultimately, I believe the choice has to made by oneself. But I do think the preceding points could definitely aid in one’s research to see what best fits him or her.

You can graduate faster in 3 years and start working earlier, but 4 years lets you do more internships and take more modules. Up to individual preference. 2) The nbs second major is severely limited. It is almost impossible to do a non-traditional second major because you only have 3 years to graduate and very few units for electives. 3) Contrary to popular belief, nbs is not well-known outside Singapore at all , although the ntu brand does have some mileage in asia. 4) CCA is a moot point becauase all unis have CCAs. However, it is true that hall life may be an important consideration for some applicants. And lastly, SMU has way better career services because: - They are located in the city, it is easy to get companies to come down or to get students to attend talks - Because they are located in the city, it is also easy for their students to do part-time internships - They have a much stronger alumni network - Their career service office is much more pro-active than nbs The nbs career office always jokes about how smu students are only good at talking/presentation. But just look at linkedin for the career outcomes of NBS students compared to SMU students. The NBS guy will probably end up in Big4 while the SMU guy is in a bank. For the record, nbs graduate here. rabbit1 wrote:  Sorry but reasons like ""career office located in city"" is superior or SMU has a stronger alumni network without substantiation sounds stupid and don't hold too much water.

But some top students I know are choosing NTU simply because they would rather start doing psych instead of waiting to claim their major. This is the key reason why people flock to NTU. If you have no worries about doing really badly in uni, the direct honors isn't really that important since you can easily qualify it if you hit a certain gpa in NUS (3.0/5.0). NTU honours degree with a really low GPA isn't seen favourably, anyway. So imo, it may not be that important for you. I'm personally leaning towards NUS simply because it's near my place, and I would like to familiarise myself with the clinical psychology department (since NUS offers a Masters). The S/U option for NUS is pretty good too, you can look at your grades and choose which subjects you don't want to count in your gpa. But in NTU, you must choose it before seeing those grades. Most of my coursemates are upset about this as well, but they're probably going to go with NTU.  As I took statistics and intro to psych in poly, amongst other psych modules (duh), I think i'm confident in getting a B and higher? But of course, I am pretty fearful that something may happen during these tests. That's the main thing that is making me doubt my choice at the moment. NUS allows you to S/U a total of 8 modules, twice the number of NTU in addition to being able to wait for results before S/Uing. If I was under the NTU system, I would have S/Ued a sociology module that I got an A for  As for ""doing psych immediately"", I don't see the rush. The two intro modules helps build up a decent foundation and there are general education modules and basket modules to clear anyway. Not to mention, the NUS system allows freedom to explore different kinds of combination.  As for whether NUS or NTU is better, there's not much difference. NUS psych don't care if NTU psych is better or not and I doubt NTU psych cares if NUS is better or not.  I know some friends who rush to clear their psych mods but for the most part, many prefer to spread it out over semesters to not overload. Nobody wants to do statistics 2, abnormal psychology, Biological Psychology, cognitive psychology, developmental psychology and social psychology in one go  The content alone is enough to kill you when you are dealing with bell curves of 70-80 regularly.",11.279903639025742

Please share your views on it as well. I really hope to get into NUS IS (I am interested in the modules offered) but no news till now so I am already prepared to face the worst scenario. I did receive an offer from SMU so I still got Plan B.  However, SMU school fees is higher than NUS by over 10k, which really makes me think whether should I take up SMU offer.  Personally, I like both SMU and NUS but school fees is really a factor that I must take into account of. Moreover, I do not have an extensive knowledge on how SMU IS curriculum. I wonder is it the same as NUS? or does it differ a lot?  So if NUS rejects me this year, I intend to reject SMU offer, and apply next year to NUS. The reason being university will no longer take into account of O Level result from Y2020 onwards. I was a PFP student and does not have an O Level result thus the long wait or possible rejection from NUS. So I would like to ask what are some of your thoughts on this?  1) Should I reject SMU this year and apply for NUS next year?  2) Do I stand a higher chance in getting accepted if I apply next year?

I graduated in 2017, coming from relevant Diploma with Merit CGPA 3.95.  I'm a PFP student as well but I do not meet the maths requirement. Thus, I've been trying DA as I have good CCA records (I won several awards in local IT competitions, represented SG in international competition before, worked as freelance developer as well as startup biz as well). I got invited for DA in 2017, but didn't manage to secure a spot. Applied last year & was rejected without interview and this year is my last year of applying as I managed to disrupt from National Service (I enlisted late). I currently accepted NTU Computer Science. I'm thinking whether to take a gap year to take O Level Maths to increase my chance as well as from Y2020 onwards, O level will not be taken into consideration. However, due to my family circumstances as well as discouragement from friends I most likely will be enrolling into NTU meanwhile just praying for some good news from NUS side. Haha.

I would say, in comparison to NBS, it feel more warmth (coz no sneks).

Honestly, it really depends on what you mean by better?   If you look in terms of RP, the 10th percentile for NTU psych is 77/90 while that for NUS FASS is 73/90. So, well you do have a higher percentage of classmates who do really well for A levels and hence, it may be a quite a competitive/motivating environment to spur you to study. [of course looking at RP is quite lame; however, I feel partly why some people presently think NUS psych is better than NTU psych may be because NTU psych used to be where some people go when they can't enter NUS FASS which probably have a higher 10th percentile a few years ago but for recent years, you can clearly see that's not the case] On the other hand, world university rankings for NUS and NTU psychology isn't actually very different and also not really that impressive, truthfully. If you really am passionate about psychology and can afford it, going to US to study psych is of course the best. If you are looking at the S/U system, hands down NUS wins. If you live far from both NTU and NUS such that you are looking at hall stays, obviously NTU halls are better since it is not only cheaper but guaranteed (without any commitment) for 2 years. If you are looking at prestige, the name NUS is probably more WOW among your friendly neighbourhood uncles and aunties but maybe not as wow if your friendly relatives with kids also in uni know you are from FASS (OK DON'T KILL ME but everyone knows how ppl make fun about ppl from arts and social sci in sg). But I mean, you choose to go to the faculty, not for the prestige but passion right so heck care them.  Honestly, i don't think there's much to compare between NTU and NUS psych rn except your own needs (travel time, what kind of culture suits you most, etc.) Have to address this point. FASS takes in students based on faculty than major so hence, the lower RP.  I think it's a better system anyway. Anyone who wants to do psych can do so but they will be cleared away by Y1 anyway.

2020,National University of Singapore|nus|computer|com|infosys|information systems|analytics|smart city,interview|Discretionary|aptitude|Scholarship,"I’m the only daughter in my family, and the youngest. My parents are pretty toxic, good at gaslighting, and pretty controlling too.   -school- Ever since I was young I wasn’t allowed to stay over at people’s houses because my parents were scared that something would happen to me. They didn’t want to let me study overseas despite my dream to, and after they didn’t allow me to take the SAT gaslighted me by talking about how much I could’ve earned working there (tsk).   Then there was the constant comparisons to other children - how they were doing better in their DIFFERENT SCHOOLS with DIFFERENT PAPERS, how they got scholarships and all these opportunities with ministers and idk what. I mean, idk about my parents but most of those kids either ended up not doing as well as me (which they never mentioned), or are dead because they committed suicide.   I think one of the worst things was that whenever I fell out with my friends by no fault of my own / got bullied and ostracised super badly (still have that trauma until now which led to anxiety, depression, low self esteem and major trust issues) they would blame me for being unlikeable or having a “personality problem”. It’s really not a great feeling when you feel like you have nobody and your bloody parents can’t even be sensitive and be there for you. My mum would always say I was temperamental and should be “gentle” and more ladylike - just to clarify I don’t really think I’m over reactive I’m just outspoken about wanting to be treated right - which I’ve come to realise, does not connote to being difficult. It just means I know where I stand and I stay there. I confided this in them once and not only did my mum play the victim, my dad makes jokes about how I shouldn’t “do something regrettable” because they raised me up so well. They also don’t believe I can have mental problems because they “raised me well”.  - as a woman -  Even earlier today they shamed me for wearing what they considered a “revealing” top and my mum said that my way of dressing would prevent me from finding good honest boys and encourage harassment - she’s from the school of victim blaming where the short skirt attracts wrongdoing but it would still be the girl’s fault. They always wanted me to dress more “elegantly” etc. I mean, I’m not going to wear a turtleneck and long pants in 40 degree weather, thank you.   Going out clubbing freaks them out so much - they will literally blast my phone so many times in the night to see whether I’m alive / not raped / kidnapped somewhere / dead and basically tell me they’re losing sleep cos I’m not home. I’m a very responsible person - never been home drunk (don’t like the feeling), never stayed over without telling them it was with a friend I trusted, never went out with people I don’t trust, really nothing to raise suspicions at all. They’re suspicious of Grab drivers so they always want to pick me up - if I say yes, they will blast my phone every 10 minutes to see if I was ready to go home even if I had told them what time I’d be done.   I wasn’t allowed to pierce my ears until I forced them to when I was 18.   They were mad I blocked them from my instagram. But my mum would check my likes and ask me about people who didn’t like my post and whether it was cos my “disagreeable” ass fell out with them. She would look at my posts and criticise my appearance etc. There was a big argument once I blocked her. She called me an ungrateful child and told me she was “very hurt” by my selfish actions. I want to live my life?   - love life -   My parents are traditional people who think I should find a deferential rich boy. Because everybody walks around with their net worth printed on their foreheads right?   I tried to be that for them, but came to realise you can’t help who you’re attracted to. I guess unfortunately for them I was attracted to my boyfriend who is from a single parent family, not of “good financial standing”, and in their opinion “ugly”. After one month of being together I told them about him, and for that month at any point in time they made sure to mention how poor, ugly and “mentally scarred” he was from his parent’s divorce. It put a lot of stress on us and we took a break for a while. We’re back together now, but I haven’t told them. None of us deserve to be subject to judgment for things we can’t control. I don’t plan to tell them anything until I am independent.  I think I learnt this too from how they ruined my brother’s relationship - they’d let his gf come to dinner and proceed to constantly trash her behind her back in front of my brother or the rest of us even. It was pretty two faced and weird. Of course, no sex before marriage. Whatever.   - where I’m at now -  I’ve been safely staying away from them by staying in my uni hostel. They are very unhappy about this, but my insistence won. My uni hostel isn’t far from home, which made them feel it was a waste of money.   I think coming to uni and being out from their influence more made me realise I was being gaslighted and emotionally abused (even if they don’t recognise it). I’ve come to draw a lot more boundaries regarding my life and learnt to stand my ground. Not to say the comments don’t sting, and I’ve still got a few more years of big stings and tears to go no doubt, but I’ve got a really good network that understands my struggle. My boyfriend has been with my the whole way through my journey and has been really understanding and also opened me up to what was happening to me.   I’ve come to really address my anxiety and depression, and although I do get the occasional panic attacks and am no perfect person by any means, I think I’ve come to accept myself a lot more than I used to. More importantly, I am a happier person. A lot of stress keeping things from them, but nevertheless so much happier.   I can’t wait to work my ass off and move out permanently.",16.868675461774057
2020,National University of Singapore|nus|computer|com|infosys|information systems|analytics|smart city,interview|Discretionary|aptitude|Scholarship,"We haven't had an updated version for some time after the latest GES was released. Now this is one of the kinds of analysis that when interpreting the visualisation you must have in mind a few caveats. Although it is generally advised not to pick a course solely on remuneration, undoubtedly some are willing to sacrifice their happiness working in a field they later find they dislike for a higher pay, and this is their decision.   That being said, this plot is still interesting enough although with a few important things to note:  \- 10% IGP is not the minimum and may be a good measure, but A lvl Rank points does not solely determine the difficulty of entrance for some courses. Especially for courses with interviews, it is quite often the case where the real difficulty lies in passing the interview and not the RP filtering stage  \- For 85 RP courses, it is obvious that quite a few could, and will be greater than 85 RP. This is just a result of the published IGPs holding GP to be a 'C' grade, a decision made by the universities/MOE.  \- This does not take into account non-normal admission like discretionary admission scheme  \- <Honour> variants of the majors were assumed to have the same IGP. If this does not seem to make sense do point out!  \- Horizontal and Vertical lines are the major-wise mean of the courses analysed here.

2020,National University of Singapore|nus|computer|com|infosys|information systems|analytics|smart city,interview|Discretionary|aptitude|Scholarship,"   The old National Theatre was the biggest inspiration for the upcoming  Founders' Memorial, as the team behind the design scoured monuments and  icons throughout Singapore's history for ideas during the creative  process.  The new memorial, which honours Singapore's pioneer leaders, will be a  linear building, which features multiple green paths that converge on  an amphitheatre.  The winning design, announced last Monday, was submitted by a team  led by Japanese firm Kengo Kuma & Associates and Singapore firm K2LD  Architects, and won against four other shortlisted designs.  During the brainstorming process, the team said, they were  particularly interested in the old National Theatre as it was an  important landmark in the Republic's history before it was demolished.  ""We were inspired by her beautiful overarching cantilevered roof and  the semi-open seating along the slopes of Fort Canning Hill,"" said the  team in an e-mail interview with The Straits Times.  They also wanted to bring back the spirit of the ""People's Theatre"",  as the old National Theatre was known back then, as a gathering place  for all Singaporeans - and the design evolved to accommodate that  vision.  ""We had multiple iterations of how best to respond to the site and  programme requirements. We went from one memorial slope to two slopes;  one path to multiple paths,"" they said.  ""We also had the idea of the building as a garden, to pay homage to the founders' vision of a garden city.""  The memorial, which sits on a 5ha site in Bay East Garden, seeks to  commemorate the values and ideals exemplified by the late founding prime  minister Lee Kuan Yew and Singapore's first-generation leaders, and  others who played key roles in the nation's early years.  The memorial will have a viewing gallery, a lake, a discovery forest trail, as well as an amphitheatre for gatherings.  The seven-member jury which unanimously selected the winning design  commended it as ""a bold and imaginative new type of memorial which rises  out of the landscape"".     Construction work is expected to start in 2022, with the memorial ready by 2027.  In its heyday, the old National Theatre, located at the corner of  Clemenceau Avenue and River Valley Road, was used for performances,  concerts and conferences.  Designed by local pioneer architect Alfred Wong and opened in 1963,  the 3,420-seat theatre had a distinctive facade with five vertical  diamond-shaped bays and an open-air auditorium with a cantilevered roof.  The theatre was closed in 1984 after it was found to be structurally  unsafe. In 1986, it was demolished to make way for a flyover that became  part of the Central Expressway.  For the upcoming memorial, the team noted it was important that it  creates ""a new dialogue and relationship between the people, nature, and  the city"" where members of the public can gather close to nature, while  looking at the city skyline.  The team, made up of consultants from architecture, engineering and  landscape design disciplines, started work on the project last January.  Mr Ko Shiou Hee from K2LD Architects said the partnership comes  naturally as both firms have collaborated on projects for over seven  years.  ""Being Japanese, Kengo Kuma has a finely tuned sensitivity to local  materials, cultures and expressions. We're familiar with his unique way  of incorporating local elements while reinterpreting with his Japanese  sensibility; a design philosophy that K2LD shares,"" he said.  The team will work with the National Heritage Board and Gardens by  the Bay to ensure the design of the memorial fits cohesively into the  masterplan of the area.  Mr Kuma, design lead of the winning team, said: ""As a marker along  the transformative history of Singapore, I hope the Founders' Memorial  would grow into a living memorial over time, where all Singaporeans can  be inspired amidst the lush gardens for generations to come.""",12.43031570345073

If you lack reading comprehension, there's no point in continuing this discussion, especially when you continue to throw out random irrelevant points/quotes unrelated to the arguments at hand.  If you do not understand the ways in which basic diplomacy and public health measures work, re-read my recommendations on how you may educate yourself with reliable sources.     To your random quote from Tedros: What Tedros said was true \*at that time given the information they had on hand\*.  And the virus' relatively low spread to the majority of other Chinese provinces remains a fact, when you look at the data on a city-by-city, province-by-province basis.  Outside the epicenter, other Chinese provinces have had relatively low numbers of cases.  In fact, during the early phases of the epidemic (now pandemic) around early-mid February, Singapore had more cases than most other Chinese cities (Singapore was ranked among the top 10 cities - \*including\* all Chinese cities - for confirmed cases).  The virus could have been contained to a much greater extent had \*all\* countries treated the situation seriously as Singapore (and the other major Asian hubs).  Tedros was not wrong in saying that the virus had the potential to be contained and mitigated - however, this containment and mitigation hinged on the cooperation of all countries around the world, and very few countries outside Asia complied with the WHO's recommendations.  For example, if someone assigns you a project and says it is doable - after which you fail to take any steps to research the project and execute on it - it makes very little sense for you to then come complaining that the project is not doable and that the teacher/supervisor assigned an impractical/unrealistic project.  Containment and mitigation was indeed possible, especially at the time Tedros made that statement.  But many countries failed to act.  Singapore government ministers have also acknowledged this point - of the way other countries' inaction have impacted the outcome, despite Singapore's best individual efforts - in interviews.     I reiterate: if you don't understand why countries or international organizations act the way they do, or why epidemiologists make certain recommendations or forecasts, study reliable sources and academic journals.  The field of public health and the field of international studies interact in very interesting ways during a pandemic, and if you are sincerely interested in learning more instead of asking kneejerk rhetorical questions based on skimmed news articles, there are many ways you can actually educate yourself during this time.  (Especially when many academic - particularly public health-related - journals are now free for the general public to access, specifically during this time.  Normally they charge exorbitant access fees to those not affiliated with research/educational institutions - but they have recently waived those fees for the general public due to the pandemic.)",11.614856652508626

At the point of application you may indicate whether you wish to be a primary school, secondary school or JC teacher, and which subjects you would like to teach. Ultimately the decision lies with the ministry and you may be given something out of your indicated preferences if it serves the organisational needs better.  You are interviewed. If you clear it you are posted to a school at your assigned teaching level to do a contract teaching stint of 6 months to a year. If your school gives its blessings, you progress on to teacher training.  If you are a degree holder, you go to NIE to get a PGDE (postgraduate diploma in education). You are immediately posted to a school, where your exact deployment will depend on the school's needs. You do not necessarily always start as a lower sec teacher teaching the ""good"" classes. In my first year of service I taught all four levels across various abilities.  The pay is the same for equally qualified and equally well performing teachers across all levels. Your pay will depend on your grade and not whether you are in primary school, secondary school or JC. The only exception is if you're a direct hire in an independent school - meaning you're not within the MOE system and pay structure.  You may be cross-deployed to a different level (e.g. trained in Sec, but move to JC or Pri) at any time, either by request or, rarely, based on some urgent need - this is more common if you teach subjects with smaller cohort sizes and smaller teacher strength. You will not have a pay cut if you move from JC to Pri/Sec or Sec to Pri, unless you are relinquishing a management position like a HOD role.  The salary varies quite a bit after just a few years of service because it depends on the rate of promotion and size of your increments. The salaries upon graduation from NIE are in the region of 4k for dudes and 3.5k for ladies, but you get your first cohort promotion pretty quickly and it's a bump of about 500. The salary is cushy with the bonuses but won't make you filthy rich. The highest monthly salary for a normal teacher who isn't holding a management position or teacher leader position is about 7.8k, and we get on average a 15 - 15.5 month annual package.  The work life depends greatly on your school's staff culture, department culture, and the expectations your reporting officer has of you. I know teachers who work 15 hours a day and I know those who are chilling at cafes or getting pedicures by 4pm.

2020,National University of Singapore|nus|computer|com|infosys|information systems|analytics|smart city,interview|Discretionary|aptitude|Scholarship,"The university admission season is in full swing.  It is timely to reflect on whether admission processes can be improved to manage the increased diversity of prospective university students.  I am a recent graduate from the National University of Singapore’s (NUS) Master of Architecture programme from the polytechnic route.  But I initially faced significant challenges securing a place in local universities, though I came third in my interior architecture diploma from Temasek Polytechnic, one of two diplomas recognised by the Board of Architects Singapore for training waivers.  NUS and the Singapore University of Technology and Design rejected my application and appeals for admission to their bachelor’s degrees in architecture.  My grade point average (GPA) as the third-highest-scoring student was not enough to even land me an interview under a discretionary admissions scheme.  An appeal letter from a Member of Parliament was the saving grace that secured me an interview. I was offered a place in the NUS bachelor’s degree in architecture in 2015 and completed it in 2018. I finished the master’s course last year.  It was disquieting to observe, for instance, that students from Singapore Polytechnic’s environment-design-related diplomas disproportionately dominated the pool of polytechnic students in the bachelor’s and master’s courses in architecture at NUS.  My checks in 2015 revealed that the GPA of the bottom 10th percentile of polytechnic students admitted to the architecture programme was higher than that of the top scorer from my Temasek Polytechnic diploma cohort. This raises the question of whether it is equitable to use the polytechnic GPA as a standard for admission to courses in local universities.     While the A-Level examinations provide a level playing field for junior college students, can we assume that the GPAs between polytechnics are a similar and fair equivalent for our polytechnic students?  Do not get me wrong. This is not a public appeal to increase places for polytechnic students. It is about ensuring that these limited seats go to the best students from the various polytechnics.  Can the Ministry of Education clarify if there are measures to ensure similar levels of rigour in the curricula of diploma courses from the different polytechnics?  And is there a similar standard for assessment and grading?  The current practice in some diploma courses to invite university academics to review the work of their final-year students is commendable and should be better structured to serve as an objective means of assessing the competence of students.    An additional GPA score, perhaps moderated at a national level and reflective of the student’s position in his course, can help universities more fairly process these applications.  Polytechnics should also publish the proportion of their diploma graduates who enter local universities, so that prospective students can make informed choices. Students who are certain that they want to pursue further education after their diplomas can thus better gauge which course will offer them the best chances.",10.327938532318537

Have not been sleeping well these few days, so quality of writing will be quite cui. All institutes of higher learning or schools for that matter have been ordered to move classes online. Restaurants only allow you to dabao food, not eat in. Everyone is advised to stay in as far as possible. I've not been out for almost a week, and only left once in the past 12 days to stock up on even more food (I've got at least 1-2 months of supplies).  It's a tough situation for us students. The general opinion here is very mixed. To start off, the term \`student' is quite heavily overloaded, since the considerations of undergrads, masters, exchange, PhD students are all very different. For exchange students or students who are graduating this semester, coming back is almost certainly the right thing to do, *unless* you have a job lined up after graduation. That one is a bit of a grey area, especially if you chose to do your degree in the states precisely because you wanted a job there.  For PhD students, research is pretty much our job (no holidays btw). If you have to work in a physical lab, then things could get sticky. Fortunately, I study CS and hence am lucky enough to be able to pretty much work from home without any disruption. At any rate, that was pretty much my life before the virus outbreak. Advisors are generally very sympathetic and are willing to pay (sometimes out of their own pocket) for students to buy webcams/tablets etc. Things vary from person to person, but I can't imagine advisors turning down requests to fly home in a time like this. That said, bear in mind its not quite right for us to ""just stop playing and leave"", since that is akin to quitting your *job* without notice.  For most of us, the considerations are  1. Chance of contracting the virus while staying vs. Risk of contracting it en-route home. This is hard to judge, since most of us are well prepared to hunker down for months. Contrast this with going home, which means going through Newark or SFO, two huge danger zones. 2. Quality of health services (taking into account possible overload of health services) vs. that in Singapore. Here, SG wins hands down. 3. Logistical issues. How do we re-enter after (and if) this whole thing dies down? How will our visas be handled? Typically student visas expire after several months of not re-entering the states. Will we ever be able to graduate? 4. Productivity. WFH sounds great, especially for nerdy, introverted CS people. (I can literally root myself in my comfortable gaming chair all day!) But in reality, my productivity has never been lower. Not only is there this constant barrage of CV-related news (I follow the situation in both SG and US), the recent advisories for the past few days made me lose even more sleep. It's really difficult to concentrate when you keep second guessing your own decisions, which explains why I'm on reddit now. Maybe if I flew back, I'd lose less sleep and actually be more productive.  IF the US had stayed on the same course as it was a week ago, then leaving is obviously the better option. But my state and city have at least *some* primitive measures to flatten the curve,  so that makes the decision a bit tougher.  Addendum: Also, spoke to my Chinese peers and their concerns are generally the same, though (3) is obviously a more major one.  Edits: grammar, writing  Edit2: I also want to add that MFA, MOE etc have been extremely helpful to all of us during this period, especially with procedures and what to expect if we chose to go back.

You get many examples of poverty stricken countries rife with corruption because of low wages but their counterparts, wealthy officials who, given an acclimatization to an indulgent lifestyle, seek even more money ala the United States, Italy, Korea. Because they are well to do, the corruption present is not as often referenced as those from less well to do countries where there is the very common stereotype of ""its okay la just bribe them so they won't take their frustrations out on you"". They are an example as to how high salaries don't necessitate lower corruption. I know you mention assist but imho the correlation between pay and corruption is not as strong as many Singaporeans may think. I believe there is a definite need to look at addressing the average sandwiched middle-class Singaporean's concerns with income inequality. When the people who society deem as more important than you also earn a much higher wage than you whilst you juggle to keep up with the increasing costs of living yet failing to be afforded most of the financial assistance available, there is a growing general feeling of ""gahmen take all my money"". To me, it's most definitely more complicated than that even though my tldr opinion is ""no gahmen is not taking ALL your money"" but the ok boomers do not develop these feelings overnight over nothing. And while we brush aside their concerns as old people coming up with bullshit to satisfy their mundane lives and answer their unfulfilled dreams and aspirations, the discontent and ill-meaning is growing. People who normally straddle the fence find solace in more extreme beliefs and ideologies. We've seen what that kind of sweeping social epidemic can do to countries like the US and the UK with society so cleanly severed into factions.

With almost every major market being shut down across the world as  governments declare lockdowns, the airline has been forced to halve its  capacity.  Things are likely to get uglier in the days and weeks to come.  SIA is likely to be forced to ground more planes and furlough more staff by the end of this month.  The airline will be in deep financial distress by the end of this quarter as revenue dives and cash flow dries up.  The company typically generates between $4.1 billion and $4.4 billion  in revenue per quarter. During October to December last year, SIA's  third quarter generated $4.5 billion in revenue and had an operating  cost of $3.4 billion, excluding borrowing and leasing cost of $191  million.  UOB Kay Hian's K. Ajith estimates that SIA's revenue could decline by  $1 billion during the current final quarter. Meanwhile, about 70 per  cent of operating costs are fixed and variable costs, which are unlikely  to decline at a faster rate than revenue, he noted.  ""As such, after factoring in interest and lease payments, we expect  SIA to see operating cash burn of about $240 million in just the final  quarter, or about $80 million per month. SIA could potentially lose over  $140 million in April, given the likely steeper decline in traffic.  Though it had cash of just $1.57 billion, factoring in short-term debt  of $835 million as at end 2019 and capex (capital expenditure)  commitment of $6 billion, it would be in a precarious position by end  June, if the Government doesn't step in with additional liquidity.""  In short, a potentially painful endgame lies ahead.  SIA is not alone. The Centre for Asia Pacific Aviation reckons half  the global airlines could disappear before the year end, casualties of  Covid-19.  >**Should SIA be saved?  While a bailout is not in the Singapore DNA, SIA is a rare case. And  these are rare times. For one thing, SIA is the most visible icon of the  Singapore brand. It is also the most awarded airline in the world...**  SIA did everything right. It maintained a diversified network and  when its Chinese operations were hit (China is estimated to be around 15  per cent to 20 per cent of its market), it focused on other markets.  Any other carrier facing such a sudden disappearance of some 20 per cent  of its market would have run to its government, hat in hand, for a  bailout.  SIA's solid financial position and diversified strategy has allowed it to ride this turbulence out, till now.  As the crisis deepened, SIA cut capacity while maintaining the  connectivity needed to bring Singaporeans home from around the world.  The alternative could have been to cut capacity as dramatically as other  airlines have done, leaving passengers, especially Singaporeans and  residents, stranded.  Many SIA aircraft were flying out of Singapore to points in China,  the United Kingdom, the United States, India and elsewhere over the past  month almost half empty, but full when returning.  But none of this matters anymore.  Today the airline faces its darkest days, with some market insiders  betting it will not survive beyond the first half of the year without  financial assistance.  The company is offering no-pay leave and implementing pay cuts for  many of its 27,000 employees. But this company also indirectly supports  up to 100,000 workers down its supply chain.  Should SIA be saved?  While a bailout is not in the Singapore DNA, SIA is a rare case. And these are rare times.  For one thing, SIA is the most visible icon of the Singapore brand.  It is also the most awarded airline in the world, listed on Fortune  Magazine's 50 most admired companies for the last few years (with the  likes of Apple, Amazon and Walt Disney, and ahead of Toyota, BMW, Visa,  Nestle, Adidas and McDonald's).  Beyond this, there are very objective and dispassionate reasons for saving SIA.  Perhaps more importantly, this is the airline which almost  single-handedly built up Singapore as a major hub, and helps maintain  this status.  It has done so by optimising flight connectivity through Changi  Airport, which today remains one of Asia's most critical hub airports.  Its diversified network ensured that it brought to Singapore many folks  who would never have otherwise set foot on the island beyond Changi  Airport.  Until this crisis hit, SIA was the 15th largest airline group in the  world, serving around 140 destinations in more than 35 countries and  territories.  This expansion has been the result of a shrewd strategy of managing  capacity growth by closely tracking economic growth, market conditions  and other variables.  SIA is also well known in the industry for its rigorous approach to  choosing aircraft and aircraft orders (there is a saying within the  industry that SIA does the due diligence for other carriers, as they  tend to follow its lead in choosing planes).  And it has done all this without tax breaks, government handouts or access to cheap fuel.  Over the last 10 years, even as it was facing increasing challenges  from the Middle Eastern players and low-cost carriers, it stuck to a  clear and established growth strategy - one that focused on its  well-known premium products on one end (SIA, Silkair), and budget on the  other (Scoot). The strategy enabled it to cover all markets, from  business to leisure, to and through the Singapore hub.  Yes, SIA should be saved.  US carriers are already looking at a potential US$50 billion (S$72  billion) bailout from Washington, while Germany's Chancellor Angela  Merkel has committed to rescuing European giant Lufthansa. Other  governments such as Denmark, Taiwan, China and Australia have already  indicated they would step in for their carriers.  Perhaps for SIA, it need not be a bailout per se. Soft loans, guaranteed by the Government, might well do the job.  The concept is not new.  During the great financial crisis, the US rolled out the Troubled  Assets Relief Programme to underwrite loans to various critical  industries, including the auto sector. While the Government here has  indicated its priority is to provide support to small and medium-sized  enterprises and focus on the social front, a home-grown icon - and a  well-run one - should surely attract some love, no?  It would indeed be a sad day for Singapore if a national icon and an  internationally admired brand is allowed to disappear due to no fault of  its own.",14.428114943083996

Your opinion is unpopular because it seem like it came from a place of naivety and fundamental lack of understanding on how diplomatic/trade deals works.  > I think you're holding on too tightly to conventional commercial wisdom when we are in true uncharted waters, with new precedents being set every day.   Please Google ""Pandemics in history"" or ""20th/21st century pandemics"".  >I can see the Malaysian government subsidising farmers to keep producing food but for the local market.  Yes, this is a given, but it'll cost the government money, right?  Therefore your suggestion is that they should *continue* to put their economic value (never mind to what to degree for now) in jeopardy - **AND** \- dig into their reserve to sustain their farms when there are plentiful alternatives out there (will get into this later)...?  Horrible idea - but sure - 2 methods of achieving that;  1. **Printing more money**: After Malaysia gets approval from the UN to print more money, banks *can* print out more money, but did you know this will directly depreciate the Ringgit? 2. **Tax increase**: Nobody wants depreciation, so let's kick up taxes instead for the locals; who likes going to the money changer and exchange for lesser foreign dollars!? It's conveniently the number one patriotic thing to do. /s  >It could even be spun as a patriotic/nationalist thing ""feed Malaysians first."" I could see Malaysia demanding air freight instead, which would be nowhere near the amount of food we get through the land borders.  When writing claims like this, it's very important that you understand the sociopolitical climate that's current in the subject country. So, for Malaysia:  The previous PM is not even low-key pro-Malay; tried an unsuccessful coup recently to overtake the government in efforts to achieve his racist ideals, and the current one infamously said ""Malay first, and Malaysian second"" in the past.  That's always exciting to have when you're Malay, except when you're the 30-40% minorities who are not. There's no ""spinning"" of patriotism or nationalism here which would result in your grand image. I have my doubts.  But yeah, alternatives like air freight a way to circumvent the ban, but you pointing this out had directly contradicted your doomsday theory of having zero imports from Malaysia... so which is it?  Or (in whispers): ""*Exemptions*"".  Thank you for agreeing with me even though you don't see it.  >Remember, everything is about politics. If Malaysia lifts the ban and another outbreak occurs because of the ""Singapore worker/supply delivery exception"", this government is finished.  You have contradicted yourself again: You argued against going with ""conventional wisdom"" in the beginning to saying everything is about politics...?  Please don't take this personally, but I don't think you have any grounds to be telling people to ""think a bit lah"" when you have demonstrated that you yourself needed that advice.  Anyway I don't think I need to repeat this anymore... but regarding your quote above: it is certainly not how geopolitics work, perhaps in your imagination, but definitely not on the planet we live in.",14.095695591952605
2020,National University of Singapore|nus|computer|com|infosys|information systems|analytics|smart city,salary|Exemption|career prospect|difficulty|pay,"   Singapore is now in the final stages of sealing a deal for its first  next-generation stealth fighter jets, joining 12 other countries who are  set to receive or currently operate the F-35 Joint Strike Fighters.  Singapore will buy four F-35Bs and evaluate them fully before  committing to a further eight, said Defence Minister Ng Eng Hen last  Monday. The first planes will be based in the United States for training  and evaluation, with delivery expected in 2026.  The US government in January gave the green light for the sale of up  to a dozen elite stealth fighter jets and related equipment to Singapore  for US$2.75 billion (S$3.79 billion). Dr Ng told Parliament last week  that the US Congress has approved the sale as well.  The Straits Times answers some remaining questions about Singapore's F-35 acquisition.  #### Q Why does delivery take six years?  **A** Other than having to clear the backlog of orders  from other countries, defence journalist Mike Yeo said Singapore could  itself have requested the 2026 delivery date to meet its own schedules  for introducing the F-35 into the Republic of Singapore Air Force  (RSAF). ""Another reason could be the potential for further reduction in  acquisition and operating costs at that time, given the F-35 will be  firmly established by then,"" he added.  In the past, it has taken other foreign countries about five years between finalising the deal and delivery of the planes.  For instance, Belgium officially selected 34 F-35As in 2018, with the first deliveries expected in 2023.  Japan announced its decision to buy 42 F-35s in 2011 and received its first planes in 2016.  #### Q Where will the first F-35s be based?  **A** Mr Yeo, who writes for Defense News website,  believes there are three air force bases in the US that are likely  candidates: Marine Corps Air Station (MCAS) Yuma in Arizona, MCAS  Miramar in California and MCAS Beaufort in South Carolina.  The Luke Air Force Base in Arizona, where international F-35 training  is conducted and where the RSAF's Peace Carvin II F-16 detachment is  based, operates the F-35A model, noted Mr Yeo, and thus might not be  useful to the RSAF's F-35Bs.  ""The most obvious reason for basing in the US for training and  evaluation is of course the availability of training airspace and less  restrictions on it.  ""The second reason is basing in the US allows the RSAF to leverage on  the US military's experience and infrastructure in operating the  (F-35B) which would allow the RSAF to adopt the established best  practices for training and operating the F-35B and its unique  capabilities,"" he added.  The US Marine Corps is the only US armed service to also operate the  F-35B, which can take off from a shorter runway and land vertically.  #### Q Why did Singapore place a small initial order for four F-35s, with an option for eight more?  **A** Mr Ben Ho, an airpower analyst with the S.  Rajaratnam School of International Studies, said this reflected  Singapore's gradualist and evolutionary approach towards defence  acquisition.  ""The Republic's modus operandi in this regard has usually been this:  make a limited purchase, slowly ease in the capability while  fastidiously assess its effectiveness and level of integration. Only  when the F-35B has been truly bedded into the RSAF/SAF edifice would  another purchase be considered.""  He noted that while Singapore's first purchase of its F-15s in 2005  was larger with 12 aircraft and an option for eight more, that plane had  ""an enviable decades-long operational record by then"".  ""The same cannot be said of the F-35 at this stage, given that it was  first deployed for operations - with the US military - only in recent  years. This lack of a track record may be key in explaining Singapore's  cautious F-35 buy,"" he added.  Dr Ng had also suggested, in response to a question by Workers' Party  chairman and Aljunied GRC MP Sylvia Lim last Monday, that further  evaluation was important before Singapore commits to a full fleet.  The minister said Singapore was ""in no hurry"" to buy the F-35s, as  the F-15SGs and F-16s are adequate for its air defence and capabilities.  ""We (will) evaluate them fully, including all the questions that were  attributed to the F-35s including costs and maintenance, before we  decide fully on a full fleet of F-35s.""  #### Q Would Singapore still buy the ""A"" variant?  **A** While some have pointed out that the F-35B variant  is more pricey and has lower range and payload compared to the ""A""  model, analysts have said the F-35B's short takeoff and landing  capabilities could allow them to take off from temporary highway strips  should the RSAF's fixed-wing facilities be taken out.  Mr Ho of RSIS said it would make sense to consider the ""A"" model,  which is cheaper and technically less complex. For instance, it can  carry a larger payload and also strike targets from further away than  the ""B"" variant.  ""It is therefore conceivable that the F-35A could be in RSAF service  one day - and this would arguably be well into the 2030s and beyond. By  then, the cost of the F-35 should have gone down significantly and its  problems rectified.""",14.065292342585755

When I posted the link, I just meant to tell people that in germany we have respect for your way of handling the situation. Here's the translation:  &#x200B;  ""We fight the Virus"" is a song to the melody of simon&garfunkels ""sound of silence"". There also is a corona-rap to which people dance in singapores schools: ""Wash your hands, dont touch your face -  thats how we rid the virus""  Thats what battle songs sound like in a fight where people trust each other. That is the spirit of singapore, to which president Lee Hsien Loong spoke:""Everyone has their task in this crisis, we dont leave anyone behind. That is the united singapore""  Also the peeping of the thermometers is one of the new sounds of singapore - at the airport, train stations in public buildings and stores.  There are 121 confirmed cases of sars-cov-2 in singapore - As of monday morning. But the important thing is: there are as many cured patients. All infections could be isolated very fast and the contacts of infected people could be identified using the contact-tracing management which was developed 17 years ago during the sars-epidemic.  The government says the situation is under control and the city does not need to be put under lockdown like in china, south korea or italy.  Life goes on in the city of millions. Schools, restourants and stores are open and theres not more then usual amount of masks. In asia it is more a tradition to wear masks not to protect ones self but to protect others. ""Every thing else would be a bad signal"", says the president and the singaporeans agree.  Be alaramed but dont panic. Of course the city has less going on as usual - that is also because there are fewer visitors. Besides people from china, south korea and italy also people from germany are no longer allowed to enter the country. Asia sees germany as a risk - one of the countries that didnt take corona serious, says president Lee: ""An alarming level of inactivity sayed so by the world health organization. We here in singapore tool covid19 serious from the beginning.""  Like all of the ministers and members of parlament they forfeit their salary to help the heros of corona fighting: nurses, cleaning workers, cab drivers. While that doesnt kill the virus, it does create solidarity. The virus is seen as an existential threat to the society and economy.  That's why reactions were detemined. Quarantine rules started with self quarantine at home; a precaution. Hospitals have more than 400 isolation beds ready.  Wrong doings have strict consequences: four foreigners with working permits have been removed from the country after violating the quarantine rules. They had made wrong statements about their whereabouts after travel.  Of course singapore can not be compared to other countries: Traffic can be controlled because it is an island and the border can be closed easily. And it is not a democracy in western sense.  News media is controlled by the government and report their message about corona - how to prevent infection. Also in the eyes of the west, singaporeans have an unbelievable amount of believe and trust in their government. That makes managing a crisis easier: people belive their government and do as they are told. That is also a reason why panic is something foreign in singapore.",13.750589490620753
2020,National University of Singapore|nus|computer|com|infosys|information systems|analytics|smart city,salary|Exemption|career prospect|difficulty|pay,"Writer is clearly justifying the case to bail out the national carrier, but really, your former PM Lee Kuan Yew mentioned that Singapore is different, in that the system will not bailout private companies and let them fail if need to be. Of course, me citing his words doesn't mean one has to follow traditions and past ideas blindly. One has to adaptive. Then again, providing a bailout just because of national pride is senseless because when it comes to business, decisions must be firmly rooted in logic and business sense. So what it has won a lot of awards? Also, given the current unpredictability of the business landscape, this company can become an absolute blackhole, sucking endless resources until it finally dies. A national carrier is like a person's car. If the economic situation is bad, lets say an individual is struggling to keep up with mortgages and other fixed payments and unable to maintain steady cash flow, would you quickly dispose the car or change to a smaller car or take public transport? One day when situation is better, maybe i can get myself the same car or better one? Or you would maintain the same car and try to refinance to lower interest rate? It all depends on your current savings and cashflow, plus future business outlook. Anyway, there's so many other corporate options other than bailing out by infusing tax payers' money. Ask the bankers and financiers to refinance, increase existing loan tenures, take on more debts, spin offs, restructure, etc. If really the national pride of Singapore, why not consider a SIA National Pride Bond and raise one round of cash from Singaporeans?   But that's a very simplistic way of thinking but essentially an important one. If Singaporeans refused to bail the national carrier, there are certainly cascading effects at many levels for example, maintenance industry, spare parts suppliers, pull-outs of foreign air industry related companies and so on. Many more and hopefully you are able to mind-map all possibilities. Finally, whether or not SIA deserves a helping hand should be a business decision based on financials and business sense, not an emotional one. SIA should explore and exhaust all possibilities by themselves first before asking for a government bailout. I look forward to reading the future case study of SIA from Harvard.  On a personal note, I have a different perspective when it comes to choosing airlines. I don't take it because the air stewards and stewardesses are handsome, pretty and professional. Also, not because it is more comfortable. These are just bonuses for me. Rather I look at the company's maintenance standards and their procurement practice. Do they procure the best or better planes or entry level planes? Additionally, I look at the country's diplomacy because even though you could be flying through a safe zone, the nationality of the aircraft company,  plays a BIG part in a safe journey. Just for example, flying on an Israelite civilian airplane over a Hezbollah infested area. It's an extreme case but cited to bring the message across. To me, Singapore is an extremely neutral country therefore I always feel safer in a Singaporean aircraft hence the willingness to pay premium when flying long journeys. I don't really associate this advantage to SIA, rather more to the Singapore brand and its diplomacy efforts.",13.508181597361174

Now this is one of the kinds of analysis that when interpreting the visualisation you must have in mind a few caveats. Although it is generally advised not to pick a course solely on remuneration, undoubtedly some are willing to sacrifice their happiness working in a field they later find they dislike for a higher pay, and this is their decision.   That being said, this plot is still interesting enough although with a few important things to note:  \- 10% IGP is not the minimum and may be a good measure, but A lvl Rank points does not solely determine the difficulty of entrance for some courses. Especially for courses with interviews, it is quite often the case where the real difficulty lies in passing the interview and not the RP filtering stage  \- For 85 RP courses, it is obvious that quite a few could, and will be greater than 85 RP. This is just a result of the published IGPs holding GP to be a 'C' grade, a decision made by the universities/MOE.  \- This does not take into account non-normal admission like discretionary admission scheme  \- <Honour> variants of the majors were assumed to have the same IGP. If this does not seem to make sense do point out!  \- Horizontal and Vertical lines are the major-wise mean of the courses analysed here. If your major is not here, it must have meant I could not obtain the data for either dimension.  \- One last thing to add is that starting salary is not necessarily the best measure for some majors. For one example, accountancy is known to have lower starting pay but more well-known for its increment/progression. So do take note of this.  \- Business Analytics is from Computing but it is a Bachelor of Science  \- the usual problems for GES in general still apply, like reporting bias, sample size etc. (although all here are >30, but that's still not significantly big).  \- Decided to do for gross starting remuneration but basic could also hold some insights.  \- For obvious reasons, there is a 3/4 year lag between the latest batch(IGP) and the batch whose GES was considered.  &#x200B;  Data was taken from MOE at: [https://www.moe.gov.sg/docs/default-source/document/education/post-secondary/files/web-publication-nus-ges-2019.pdf](https://www.moe.gov.sg/docs/default-source/document/education/post-secondary/files/web-publication-nus-ges-2019.pdf)  Some footnotes copy and pasted from their report:  ""  6.

2020,National University of Singapore|nus|computer|com|infosys|information systems|analytics|smart city,salary|Exemption|career prospect|difficulty|pay,"   The old National Theatre was the biggest inspiration for the upcoming  Founders' Memorial, as the team behind the design scoured monuments and  icons throughout Singapore's history for ideas during the creative  process.  The new memorial, which honours Singapore's pioneer leaders, will be a  linear building, which features multiple green paths that converge on  an amphitheatre.  The winning design, announced last Monday, was submitted by a team  led by Japanese firm Kengo Kuma & Associates and Singapore firm K2LD  Architects, and won against four other shortlisted designs.  During the brainstorming process, the team said, they were  particularly interested in the old National Theatre as it was an  important landmark in the Republic's history before it was demolished.  ""We were inspired by her beautiful overarching cantilevered roof and  the semi-open seating along the slopes of Fort Canning Hill,"" said the  team in an e-mail interview with The Straits Times.  They also wanted to bring back the spirit of the ""People's Theatre"",  as the old National Theatre was known back then, as a gathering place  for all Singaporeans - and the design evolved to accommodate that  vision.  ""We had multiple iterations of how best to respond to the site and  programme requirements. We went from one memorial slope to two slopes;  one path to multiple paths,"" they said.  ""We also had the idea of the building as a garden, to pay homage to the founders' vision of a garden city.""  The memorial, which sits on a 5ha site in Bay East Garden, seeks to  commemorate the values and ideals exemplified by the late founding prime  minister Lee Kuan Yew and Singapore's first-generation leaders, and  others who played key roles in the nation's early years.  The memorial will have a viewing gallery, a lake, a discovery forest trail, as well as an amphitheatre for gatherings.  The seven-member jury which unanimously selected the winning design  commended it as ""a bold and imaginative new type of memorial which rises  out of the landscape"".     Construction work is expected to start in 2022, with the memorial ready by 2027.  In its heyday, the old National Theatre, located at the corner of  Clemenceau Avenue and River Valley Road, was used for performances,  concerts and conferences.  Designed by local pioneer architect Alfred Wong and opened in 1963,  the 3,420-seat theatre had a distinctive facade with five vertical  diamond-shaped bays and an open-air auditorium with a cantilevered roof.  The theatre was closed in 1984 after it was found to be structurally  unsafe. In 1986, it was demolished to make way for a flyover that became  part of the Central Expressway.  For the upcoming memorial, the team noted it was important that it  creates ""a new dialogue and relationship between the people, nature, and  the city"" where members of the public can gather close to nature, while  looking at the city skyline.  The team, made up of consultants from architecture, engineering and  landscape design disciplines, started work on the project last January.  Mr Ko Shiou Hee from K2LD Architects said the partnership comes  naturally as both firms have collaborated on projects for over seven  years.  ""Being Japanese, Kengo Kuma has a finely tuned sensitivity to local  materials, cultures and expressions. We're familiar with his unique way  of incorporating local elements while reinterpreting with his Japanese  sensibility; a design philosophy that K2LD shares,"" he said.  The team will work with the National Heritage Board and Gardens by  the Bay to ensure the design of the memorial fits cohesively into the  masterplan of the area.  Mr Kuma, design lead of the winning team, said: ""As a marker along  the transformative history of Singapore, I hope the Founders' Memorial  would grow into a living memorial over time, where all Singaporeans can  be inspired amidst the lush gardens for generations to come.""",12.243140517808627

I now commute 2.5 hours to Singapore to work from my JB hometown; the pay, however, is 3.1x, which, if I save at the current rate, I can hold 6 months' worth of salary as emergency savings, in the next 1.3 years. Compared to my salary in KL, I am living day-to-day trying to make ends meet. 2. I had access to friends from university days, as well as friends I made because I was part of the ex-com for some of the anime events in Kuala Lumpur. Enjoyed the random Touhou madness at events, watched live viewings of anime-based concerts in theatres, enjoyed Japan Expo in Malaysia by wota-ing with fellow friends to idol songs, and even attended casual meetups with Japanese exchange students and working adults, trying to communicate in Japanese. Also played a bit of board games and D&D with like-minded people. Still watching Critical Role now albeit *very slowly*. 3. Compared to that lifestyle, I am currently living as a hermit; I'm trying to build my emergency savings as well as some kind of savings that I can carry forward to moving out of Singapore. I'm currently studying Japanese as a 3rd language, intending to take JLPT 4 this July. However, due to the long commutes (every day is 5 hours going up and down the Causeway) I could not afford to have a social life. 4. In the end, I attempted to take my own life in 2018 because I couldn't cope with my constant comparison of my current financial status against others (saving money in Malaysia is more difficult compared to saving money in Singapore). Because of that, I stopped living alone, and returned to my hometown to find work in Singapore. I managed to land myself a job last April, and have been saving money ever since. 5. Even if I don't have a social life right now, I'm aware that I come back to a family that accepts me even if I don't share their political ideologies. Friends can only do so much; family will still have to pick up my mess, there's something about knowing my place to realise I have a lot of unresolved things needed to tend to by myself.  I had a good time living alone in KL after my university time. Too bad I now know I have some sort of mental issues, I couldn't live alone because I can go into these lapses of self-doubt and comparison. Only through constant distraction and having to go back and forth across the Causeway can my mind stop going into that direction. Therefore I intentionally deleted Facebook and Instagram, and kept my Twitter to only following Japanese celebrities and illustrators so that I am not in tune to political stuffs and current affairs.",12.073683501350095

To answer your questions:  1. You will need to remove it as a measure of confidence. Most paramedics wear [short sleeved vests](https://nyp.jobscentral.com.sg/magazine/polytechnic-2017/img/scdf-masthead.jpg) so your tattoo will be visible.  2. Shift cycles go by this: 2 13-hour daytime shifts, 1 day of ""reserved duty"" (administrative work), 1 day off, 2 11-hour night shifts, another day of ""reserved duty"", and 1 day off. By mandate, any work that requires a total of 24 hours of employed work needs to be offset by 48 hours of rest, but because paramedics in SCDF work in staggered 24-hour shifts, there's some flexibility involved.  3. Could you elaborate on what specifics you want to pursue? Urban search and rescue? Mass casualty response? Emergency psychology? These fields are available once you have informed your officer-in-charge of your desired expertise. Usually after you have stabilised for a period of tiem, you can approach your officer-in-charge to plan your career.  4. This will be long, and my memory was taken from my discussions with fellow paramedics that I talked to in my time as a medic, so your mileage may vary.  To start, you will be attached to SAF Medical School seconded under the SCDF organization to train you up on emergency field paramedicine. The total time will be three years, with each year you're being tested on practical and theory work. You will be attached at least six months to a fire station (not sure if by choice or by allocation of manpower resources) to pick up the training on handling real-life patients. You will be mostly performing more advanced duties like needle injection and infusion (IV), airway tubing, vacuum suctioning, ECG and pre-hospital ACLS routines, advanced spine management, extreme traumatic injuries, inter- and post-natal emergencies, and first aid that an NSF medic isn't expected to handle. You will also be learning on field management (e.g. radio reporting, situational awareness etc.) to complement your paramedicine duties. Afterwards, you will be tested, and you need to pass 80% of your assessments to advance to the next level of paramedicine. Only after the completion of 3 years of training will you be officially a paramedic.  Afterwards, you are attached to a fire station, still, not sure if by choice or by current allocation. You have two overall in charge: the commanding officer for the fire station, and the paramedic officer-in-charge of EMS. You will follow the regulations as set by the fire station CO, (as an overall leader in charge of the fire station representing SCDF at large), and you will follow the occupation regulations as set forth by the OIC (operational procedures, case paperwork, medical logistics etc.). Depending on your level of experience, you can be seconded as an assistant to the OIC, or you can be posted as a fast-response paramedic (usually it's performed by paramedics converted from fire and rescue units).  Most firefighters are OK with paramedics, but because the operational framework is different (one deals with fires and rescue operations, the other, fixing the human body so that it survives the hsopital trip) the only other time you get together is in drills and exercises, as well as station bonding activities and various inter-department and inter-division activities.

2020,National University of Singapore|nus|computer|com|infosys|information systems|analytics|smart city,career|prospect,"Turned 30 a couple months ago.  Last year I was still actively trying to meet new people. Got into a whirlwind relationship with a guy who apparently fell for me really quickly (a bit of a red flag which I had addressed to him several times, warning him not to just talk about how he was going to be the best partner and make all these promises and get my hopes up). He also talked about marriage a lot. Eventually I went along with it and I was happy because I thought I'd found a life partner, which is my goal. So, I put all my effort into the relationship.  He freelanced and was in a band, and I loaned him money, or bought stuff for him, paid for a LOT of things. Met his bandmates, tried my best to be the best supportive GF and even paid for their drinks at his bandmate's birthday event.  Weeks passed, he fucked up some band stuff because apparently 'he was too distracted by a relationship' and his bandmates apparently all agreed that the relationship was fucking with him (and I'm still super sour about how they approached him about it). And by the way, I wasn't even meeting him much around that time because I knew what he was working on was big.  *Note: To be clear, I never demanded his time (again, trying to be the best supportive GF I could be). I would work around HIS schedule and/or location for meetups. If he could only meet for an hour, I would never throw a fit or get mad, and I was super understanding.*  So, based on what all his bandmates said, he came over to my block one night and just told me he needs to focus on his career because other things were also going to come up and he was going to get busier. I was obviously crushed because like I said, my initial fears of him talking about long term plans so early on all came true.  I was mad that he hadn't considered his career and work before making all those promises, and even madder at myself for having spent so much money on him. I tried to defend myself and reminded him how I never expected much from him, and how I've been nothing but supportive in all his endeavors and even with his friends.  That relationship really fucked me up. I started drinking a lot after that, and honestly I'm still still struggling with sobriety now. The drinking also made me make some really bad decisions and got me in bad situations. A few months ago I was out with a friend drinking and friend went home first because she'd already puked. Her BF came to pick her up and I assured her I was going to finish my drink and head home after. At this point the place was already spinning for me. After she left I took out my phone to reply to texts and I responded to someone who I was talking to on OKC. I made the huge mistake of telling him I was alone and drunk. He arrived where I was in fifteen minutes and immediately whisked me back to his apartment (this was the first time we met) where I was basically 'held' the whole night and I couldn't leave until I got him off twice and he fell asleep. He didn't stop even though I was crying and I just wanted to go home.  So, that incident just fucked with me even more, and again I turned to more booze, only this time coupled with severe social isolation (this is even before the virus). I meet friends maybe once a month but honestly if it were up to me I would just never go out again. I have tried talking to new people but I'm just so fucked up now I know it's not fair to even think about a relationship before I fix myself.  tl;dr - Last relationship triggered me to start drinking heavily (yes I am aware it was a choice that I made), which led to a bad situation, which led to more drinking and isolating myself. Gotta work on myself before thinking about relationships.  Sorry for the grandmother story  \---------------  Edit: The responses and messages I've gotten have been so overwhelmingly positive and encouraging - thank you all for your support. This makes me even more determined to turn my life around and stop punishing myself for someone else's mistakes. I love you guys. <3",13.14949035260977
2020,National University of Singapore|nus|computer|com|infosys|information systems|analytics|smart city,career|prospect,"I had parents who were overly concerned over what I studied and what I worked in and also who my friends were. I was discouraged from taking the course that I wanted and told to take a course they preferred in Poly. Eventually, in Uni, I had to take the same course and graduated. I did not like it, but I did what I had to do, I actually graduated with a good GPA.   So i thought that was it, I did what they wanted, I'm free to choose my own career path. Nope, my father got me a job in his industry and was very unhappy when I said I wanted to go into something else he deemed frivolous. I worked in a qausi government-owned company which made me absolutely miserable and I went through a period of depression where I had to seek professional help. The problem for me there is that local bosses are also helicopters. They often bulled me, intimidated me or threatened me, I'm not sure if its just me who invites these things, but the high turnover said something about the environment there.   I'm now still in the industry but doing way better. I got a job in an MNC with a boss based in the US, which really helps for me as I grew up with helicopters, so my boss now is far away and leaves me to my own devices. I got a role within the industry where I have a good degree of autonomy and can make my own decisions, which the mental health professional I consulted said would help me - he was right.   For some time, I was still unhappy and I was only really truly happy when I moved out of home. Suddenly, I was free to be myself, to pursue my own hobbies. I love the outdoors, it gives me a sense of peace, but everytime I wanted to schedule a camping trip, I was actively discouraged. After moving on and out, I was free to do all of it, and I got my scuba diving license, I hiked several hills/mountains in Malaysia, Indonesia and even went to Scotland and New Zealand to hike. I've travelled the world, rode the sand dunes in Dubai, backpacked Europe for 2 months, took long road trips in Australia, had an amazing time in the US and China, the list goes on.   I'm now married, I make my own decisions equally with my husband, see my parents about once every 2 weeks for maybe 3hrs for a meal and I have a sense of calmness I've never had while living under judgemental eyes for over 30 years. I realise now it was that sense of inner peace that I never had living with my parents that made me anxious and kept me miserable and looking for escape at every opportunity. I think as a daughter of helicopter parent(s), it is very difficult for us to move on with our own lives but the best decision I ever made was striking out on my own, of course my parents aren't the happiest about my decision, but now they respect me and respect my husband enough to leave me alone.",12.333496999454367

I have about 90k in cash & liquid assets, she has about 10k in cash. We’re looking at starting our life together soon and been pondering resale. Is that feasible? A 3-4 room flat will do, or should we go for a 5 room for resale purposes? Deciding between balloting bto. When is the next balance of sales? And is balnce of sale cheaper than resale?  We have a few things to discuss between ourselves like when we are aiming to retire and what kind of lifestyle to have in retirement and of course if we want to have kids. (How much do these little rascals cost anyway?)  I’ve been thinking about furthering my education to give me a competitive edge. I’ve been thinking of a really expensive full time MBA program (INSEAD) which will really exhaust my entire savings and put me into debt. Is it possible to go into this program and still hold down a loan on housing? Perhaps get BTO then go MBA and come out with 2 huge debts? Personally I want to live to my maximum potential and be given the opportunity to climb the corporate ladder. Big dreams, but right now I’m in an SME that really appreciates my talent but I feel like the growth is limited here. What career advice can you guys offer?  Honestly, I have been stuck in a rut and been avoiding all these questions that needs to be answered and I need to get my shit together. My current salary is pretty comfortable but I know I can do more and at my age its the best time to push hard. Should I go for the 150k MBA? Or should I keep pushing in this SME and hope for the best? Should we settle down now and get our own place? I’m honestly quite afraid of being ladened with so much debt. Right now I love being able to say fuck you to my boss and leave with little repercussions, no debt, no family to feed, no big bills. What advice do you have on this?   How much is enough for retirement? When should I retire? So many questions.  Sorry for the long rant and questions. I can really use some guidance now and I have no idea who to turn to.

In my 3rd job, where I told my boss I intended to leave and he counteroffered me with a 70% pay raise and still open for negotiation which I rejected anyway because I'm bored with that company and decided to jump ship to a lower pay (in which I managed to get that amount of salary raised within a year anyway through promotion in new company).

It is timely to reflect on whether admission processes can be improved to manage the increased diversity of prospective university students.  I am a recent graduate from the National University of Singapore’s (NUS) Master of Architecture programme from the polytechnic route.  But I initially faced significant challenges securing a place in local universities, though I came third in my interior architecture diploma from Temasek Polytechnic, one of two diplomas recognised by the Board of Architects Singapore for training waivers.  NUS and the Singapore University of Technology and Design rejected my application and appeals for admission to their bachelor’s degrees in architecture.  My grade point average (GPA) as the third-highest-scoring student was not enough to even land me an interview under a discretionary admissions scheme.  An appeal letter from a Member of Parliament was the saving grace that secured me an interview. I was offered a place in the NUS bachelor’s degree in architecture in 2015 and completed it in 2018.

It was disquieting to observe, for instance, that students from Singapore Polytechnic’s environment-design-related diplomas disproportionately dominated the pool of polytechnic students in the bachelor’s and master’s courses in architecture at NUS.  My checks in 2015 revealed that the GPA of the bottom 10th percentile of polytechnic students admitted to the architecture programme was higher than that of the top scorer from my Temasek Polytechnic diploma cohort. This raises the question of whether it is equitable to use the polytechnic GPA as a standard for admission to courses in local universities.     While the A-Level examinations provide a level playing field for junior college students, can we assume that the GPAs between polytechnics are a similar and fair equivalent for our polytechnic students?  Do not get me wrong. This is not a public appeal to increase places for polytechnic students. It is about ensuring that these limited seats go to the best students from the various polytechnics.

2020,National University of Singapore|nus|computer|com|infosys|information systems|analytics|smart city,career|prospect,"Serious answer, and just sharing my own experience: it’s a combination of help from previous generations, hard work, and good fortune.   In my case:  1) Help from parents, starting from getting me into “elite” schools and help with subjects I was weaker in for tuition, and later on, loaning me money for a down payment for my first private property. That helped me parlay the first property into a bigger one, repay them, and climb up the mortgage ladder.   2) Picking a career that pays decently, and working hard at it. When I was just starting out, 16-18 hour days were the norm, and that definitely helped get ahead of the pack. I also married someone in the same profession, so the combined income helps.  3) Definitely have been fortunate throughout - no terrible investments that I’ve regretted and some which have appreciated well enough to make decent amounts.   This is in no way be indicative of everyone reasonably well-off who might fall into this category, but I’ve grown up with enough folks who have similar life experiences to know that it’s not an uncommon story.   Side note: The effect of social stratification is something I’ve been thinking about a lot more as I get older and have had a kid of my own, who will grow up with the same advantages and safety net I had.

2020,National University of Singapore|nus|computer|com|infosys|information systems|analytics|smart city,career|prospect,"Let me share with you my journey. TLDR: A Levels was a defining moment but definitely not pivotal.   I was in Arts stream for A levels - partly because I was forced to drop Additional Mathematics during O levels (thereby closing alot of doors) and partly because of interest (I was interested in History having enjoyed Pure History in O levels). Year 1 was tough. But year 2 was a heck more fun because something clicked in me and I guess I began to understand the skills needed for A level humanities. But my A level journey was a defining moment because I, for the first time in my life, had career ambitions and I worked towards it. Like you, I was under the impression that there exists only a linear path: do well in JC -> do well in reputable University and then a good job is guaranteed.   But as I went along ...I realized that life isn’t so straightforward.   Getting into a reputable university isn’t enough. During my university days, I met people from diverse education background. There was this dude who failed As, went polytechnic and did well to come to Uni.   Doing consistently well in University is traditionally a key (not the only one) to a good job but everything depends on you. And if you are an average student like me, you need to manage priorities to do well or you will have to make sacrifices. And forget about your parents’ advice that a good job is guaranteed with good results. Secure as many internships as you can. Many companies and public sector agencies now use internships as a litmus test for future employment. I have friends, with 1st class degrees from reputable universities, still unemployed or under-employed. Conversely, I do have friends with third class or 2nd lower degrees securing good jobs (subjective though) even before graduation.   When you step into the working world, its a different ball game. What is a good job? High paying? Prestigious? Good bosses? Work-life balance? Easy?   Life is subjective and there are a trillion ways to go around getting what you want. Scoring well for As is just a step, out of many, to a reputable University. Scoring well in a reputable University is just one of the steps to a good job. And a good job may not be that good after all when you actually get in.  Look at your priorities and work towards it.",9.814281480944434

Career-wise, ask yourself - what parent of their child’s school is going to want a principal who had a track record of condoning or being unable to stop a problem as basic as bullying? It also becomes an indelible stain on his record. Even if the principal doesn’t get demoted, he will have a hard time being employed in other ministries, much less be considered for future promotions.   What will likely happen is that the school will fast-track an investigation into the matter. The case will be closed ASAP, a statement will be made about what has been done with the bullies, what will be done for the bullied, and the measures the school will take to address the situation and prevent similar issues from happening again (to regain public confidence).

Now this is one of the kinds of analysis that when interpreting the visualisation you must have in mind a few caveats. Although it is generally advised not to pick a course solely on remuneration, undoubtedly some are willing to sacrifice their happiness working in a field they later find they dislike for a higher pay, and this is their decision.   That being said, this plot is still interesting enough although with a few important things to note:  \- 10% IGP is not the minimum and may be a good measure, but A lvl Rank points does not solely determine the difficulty of entrance for some courses. Especially for courses with interviews, it is quite often the case where the real difficulty lies in passing the interview and not the RP filtering stage  \- For 85 RP courses, it is obvious that quite a few could, and will be greater than 85 RP. This is just a result of the published IGPs holding GP to be a 'C' grade, a decision made by the universities/MOE.  \- This does not take into account non-normal admission like discretionary admission scheme  \- <Honour> variants of the majors were assumed to have the same IGP. If this does not seem to make sense do point out!  \- Horizontal and Vertical lines are the major-wise mean of the courses analysed here. If your major is not here, it must have meant I could not obtain the data for either dimension.  \- One last thing to add is that starting salary is not necessarily the best measure for some majors. For one example, accountancy is known to have lower starting pay but more well-known for its increment/progression. So do take note of this.  \- Business Analytics is from Computing but it is a Bachelor of Science  \- the usual problems for GES in general still apply, like reporting bias, sample size etc. (although all here are >30, but that's still not significantly big).  \- Decided to do for gross starting remuneration but basic could also hold some insights.  \- For obvious reasons, there is a 3/4 year lag between the latest batch(IGP) and the batch whose GES was considered.  &#x200B;  Data was taken from MOE at: [https://www.moe.gov.sg/docs/default-source/document/education/post-secondary/files/web-publication-nus-ges-2019.pdf](https://www.moe.gov.sg/docs/default-source/document/education/post-secondary/files/web-publication-nus-ges-2019.pdf)  Some footnotes copy and pasted from their report:  ""  6.

With developments on the coronavirus outbreak - including new border restriction measures announced on Sunday to reduce the number of imported cases into Singapore - the MOE and institutes of higher learning (IHLs) have decided to suspend all official overseas placements until the end of July.  ""Students who are currently on such overseas placements will be recalled as soon as is practicable,"" said the ministry.   The MOE said that IHLs will address students' concerns about the loss of credits earned during their exchanges or placements.  There will be no delay in students' graduation and the IHLs will support affected students by providing alternative learning arrangements, such as credit-bearing modules during the summer semester or local internship placements.  ""As most of the affected students are second- or third-year students, they also have the option to take additional credits in subsequent years.  ""In the coming weeks, the IHLs will work with each affected student to finalise these alternative arrangements,"" the MOE said.  It added that the alternative arrangements should not impose additional financial cost to students, and the additional modules or local internships will not add to the current school fees.  ""MOE will continue to monitor the global situation and work closely with the IHLs to take appropriate measures to ensure the safety and well-being of our students,"" it said.  The National University of Singapore (NUS) has already asked students to come home.   It is recalling some 200 students on an overseas internship programme after the MOE last Friday afternoon issued a directive requiring all overseas students at IHLs to return to Singapore as soon as possible.  The recall by NUS will be a large-scale operation that needs to be done in phases due to the size of the programme's cohort, according to an e-mail sent by the university to students on the NUS Overseas College Programme (NOC), which was seen by The Straits Times.  The NOC is an internship programme with an emphasis on technology entrepreneurship, and participants spend either six months or a year at a start-up overseas and take entrepreneurship courses at a designated partner university.  NUS Overseas Colleges director Chee Yeow Meng said in the e-mail: ""NUS has been closely monitoring the Covid-19 outbreak across the world, with great concern.  ""The recent global development has caused serious concerns in NUS senior management for your health and safety, even more so with the trends these last couple of days.  ""We now feel it prudent and urgent to recall all overseas NOC students back to Singapore,"" added Professor Chee, who is also associate vice-president for innovation and enterprise.  Providing more details on the recall, he said the students' location managers and directors will be in touch with them on the dates, periods and logistical arrangements for their journey back to Singapore.  They will also help students to obtain air tickets for their return.  The university will pay or reimburse students' flights back to Singapore and other transport costs.  It will also reimburse their rental deposits, outstanding rental obligations on their accommodation, mobile and Wi-Fi plans, shipping of belongings and extra baggage allowance within reason, and other items on a case-by-case basis.  NUS will also inform students' internship companies about the recall and find ways for students to continue their internship with the companies in Singapore as an option, where possible.  ""We will ensure that you will suffer no academic loss and financial loss due to this recall,"" Prof Chee wrote, adding that the university will put in place a meaningful programme for students to continue their NOC programme in Singapore even after they return.  They will also fully receive their academic credits for the programme.  On measures students will have to take upon returning to Singapore, Prof Chee said all those returning from Germany will be issued a stay-home notice, as directed by the Ministry of Health.  Students returning from other countries will be asked to go on a voluntary leave of absence for 14 days, away from the NUS campus.  The university will provide an on-campus facility for students' self-isolation period if their family is not in Singapore or they prefer to serve their stay-home notice or leave of absence away from home.

Working hard and smart to climb the corporate ladder to show that you are a valuable asset to your company. This gives you a lot of room for negotiations within your company and if you feel you are not suffificiently compensated you can just as easily find another job with your skills compared to others. Of course this requires you to understand which job markets are in demand.  Next would be to learn about investing. My implication of investing does not mean buy whatever anyone says is a good stock, but instead learn to read financial statements, determine a good buy entry, good portfolio risk management(such as using derivatives to hedge your portoflio) and the discipline to allocate a fixed(or increasing) amount every month to your portfolio. The compounded returns will really make a difference especially if you are doing this for your whole working life(30-40 years). If you really dont understand anything you can start off with ETFs first as they are simpler to understand and come with very minimal expense ratio(something like management fee).  Lastly really is just a repeat of what the government have always been saying, upskilling or whatever they call it. Take courses from EdX or Coursera to boost your skills and knowledge so that the likelihood that you will he caught up in a situation where your skills is irrelevant due to being displaced by outsourcing or automation is slim. You can use the online platforms mentioned to learn more in depth about investing as well and if i remember correctly you can use your Skillsfuture(correct me if im wrong) to be a certified student.",10.722866311221296

2020,National University of Singapore|nus|computer|com|infosys|information systems|analytics|smart city,Curriculum|Curriculumn|courses|modules|pedagogy,"Nus cs student here. Cs1010e is a programming module taken by engineering students under the school of computing and it isnt taken by computer science students. It is a compulsory module for them. Though for this semester, there are more students from other faculties taking 1010e apart from engineering students because many engineering students would have cleared in last semester. Computer science students are expected to take another module called CS1101S. So we are not related to this saga.  SoC is pretty notorious for their hard introductory programming modules and setting killer papers. As such, i kind of get why students in 1010e would resort to cheating.   First reason is because they arent com sci student, and personally i feel that its absurb to subject them to such programming rigour. So that might have had been a motivating factor and i can kind of relate to it. Cs modules in nus are fking crazy and i feel since engineering students are not training to be future software engineers, 1010e should be revamped to a slightly chill module. Perhaps just to introduce syntax and solve some simpler questions with lighter workload.  Second is because generally, i feel that the school is asking for it by using examplify, which is an online exam platform. If its so difficult to organise midterms, then why not considering scrapping it, or run a 10 venue assessment like how prof ben leong did? It is not possible to prevent cheating under such circumstances because of how large the cohort is. Even if you dont cheat, other students will collude and you run the risk of losing out to others. (Though admittedly its quite dumb that they copy and pasted the code directly which triggered the plagarism checker)",9.797816915805956

Could it be that they were looking for other qualities aside from their GPA score?    > students from Singapore Polytechnic’s environment-design-related diplomas disproportionately dominated the pool of polytechnic students in the bachelor’s and master’s courses in architecture at NUS.    Perhaps there was a decision that was made to accept poly students from those specific areas of discipline/schools for the course? Like, “the meta” and University’s vision shifted?    Like back when I was schooling, the (then existing) Direct School Admission meta always shift, depending on the alternate years, and what the school is looking for or focusing on.   Singapore Youth Festival competition? Sports? Maybe specific CCAs need desperate help and are willing to take in a surge of those CCA-talented students if it means securing that championship or Gold award. For example, some schools have to choose between a top scoring student (there’s plenty of them) or a student athlete that has represented Singapore well on the international stage. Sounds like an easy pick, no matter how unfair it might sound.",8.919210665218248

Have you taken NUS SoC programming mods? It's not that these students have issues with programming or that programming is difficult. You can go to those govt-subsidised Python bootcamps and press play on jupyter notebook cells and learning programming is all fun and easy. Except that in SoC, the mods are designed to be difficult and stretch your understanding of core topics like recursion.  They teach you the basics and first principles via lectures, and then give you many assignments/tests that really challenge your understanding of these first principles. That's how we learn here. The tests are meant to be difficult.  The issue here is simply the portion of Engineering students having integrity issues and a lack of tenacity. The mod can be hard and all, but they didn't have to resort to plagiarism. Some of them also can't be half-arsed to properly learn this mod because it's ""just a graduation requirement"" to them, since they are not computing majors.  A better question for you to ask is, does CS1010E need to be as rigorous as it currently is (it actually really isn't as difficult as the other CS1101S/CS1010* modules) for engineering students? You could argue that in some ways, it being so rigorous ""caused the students to cheat"", but even for this line of argument, the fault is clearly on the students.",8.691495566953863

For engin, it's a bit subjective to say they are smart in terms of grades? Since if you look at a lot of engin courses, their igp entry requirements are one of the lowest among all the other courses offered by the top public unis in sg.   But engin has such a huge cohort, and from my observation, there's crazy smart people and the ones who just made it in (going back to their low igp entry requirements as aforementioned). Those whose gpa is not good enough wouldnt be able to qualify for the sponsored masters in management programmes that companies offer high gpa bearers.  So that's why they probably go into insurance?? All the promises of vacay and what not; if you can't be a head engineer or get some high level managerial position, might as well try to be a top insurance agent where everyone seems to start equal regardless of qualifications..?",8.450875967366256
